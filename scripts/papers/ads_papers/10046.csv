1971GeCoA..35..865T|1971|Ferromagnetic resonance of lunar samples|Tsay, Fun-Dow, Chan, Sunney I., Manatt, Stanley L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|35|9|865|Evidence is presented to support that the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra observed for a selection of Apollo 11 lunar samples (10087-10, 11; 10046-29, 30; 10062-26, 27; 10017-35, 36) arise from the ferromagnetic centers consisting of metallic Fe. A model study to simulate the polycrystalline spectra has been carried out, from which it was possible to ascertain with some degree of certainty the size and shape of the ferromagnetic centers as well as the metallic iron content. Some variations in the metallic Fe content have been noted in these samples, for example, between rocks and fine soil.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(71)90001-9

Craters with diameters between 2 microns and 0.8 mm were observed. Approx. 1 crater larger than 0.15 mm in diameter per 1 mm <SUP>2</SUP> and 1 crater larger than 2 μm per 500 μm <SUP>2</SUP> could be found. The time of exposure is calculated from crater number densities and cosmic dust influx values to be 10 000 yr and 100 yr for layers of respectivethicknesses. On lunar glassy spherules impact features were found which yield the same crater number densities. The phenomenology of high velocity impacts was studies by shooting microspheres on targets similar to lunar material using a 2 MV dust accelerator.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90095-6
