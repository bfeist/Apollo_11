1971GeCoA..35..865T|1971|Ferromagnetic resonance of lunar samples|Tsay, Fun-Dow, Chan, Sunney I., Manatt, Stanley L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|35|9|865|Evidence is presented to support that the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra observed for a selection of Apollo 11 lunar samples (10087-10, 11; 10046-29, 30; 10062-26, 27; 10017-35, 36) arise from the ferromagnetic centers consisting of metallic Fe. A model study to simulate the polycrystalline spectra has been carried out, from which it was possible to ascertain with some degree of certainty the size and shape of the ferromagnetic centers as well as the metallic iron content. Some variations in the metallic Fe content have been noted in these samples, for example, between rocks and fine soil.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(71)90001-9

R.|Journal of Geophysical Research|75|32|6553|Heat-capacity measurements have been made on portions of lunar rocks 10017 and 10046 in the temperature region 2° to 5°K. For both specimens, the heat capacity is over 100 times greater than is predicted from acoustic wave velocities measured in the same rocks. Several possible reasons for this behavior are considered. It is concluded that the effect originates in the existence of one or more small peaks in the low-frequency part of the vibrational frequency distribution. The ‘excess’ heat capacity of rock 10017 can be accounted for semiquantitatively by one such peak containing 3% of the normal modes at a frequency of 5 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. Thermal equilibration in rock 10046 was sufficiently slow to allow a good estimate to be made of its thermal conductivity. The result, K = 2.5(±0.5) × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> cal/sec cm deg, is compared with values obtained by using other experimental techniques. The thermal conductivity of rock 10017 was found to be 10 to 100 times larger.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB075i032p06553

B., Simmons, G.|Journal of Geophysical Research|75|32|6524|Presented here are values of dielectric permittivity, dissipation factor, and electrical conductivity of Apollo 11 lunar samples 10020, 10057, and 10046 in the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 MHz and temperature range from -196°C to + 200°C. The dielectric properties determined on earth basalts and a simulated lunar material with the composition of the Surveyor 5 results are used to characterize the dielectric properties of these lunar samples. We conclude that: (1) the lunar samples have higher values of the dielectric constant than terrestrial basalts, an effect due probably to the presence of ilmenite in the lunar samples, and the high-frequency dielectric constant of the lunar igneous samples is about 9 to 15, whereas that of the lunar breccia is about 6 to 9; (2) the lunar samples show greater dielectric losses than terrestrial basalts, and the loss tangents measured on the lunar igneous samples are consistently higher than those of the lunar breccia, ranging from 0.09 to 0.2 for the igneous samples and 0.5 to 0.09 for the breccia; (3) the electrical conductivity values for the lunar samples are 10<SUP>-9</SUP> to 10<SUP>-11</SUP> (ohm cm)<SUP>-1</SUP>, and the electrical conductivity of the lunar igneous samples depends more strongly on temperature than that observed for the lunar brecica; (4) all the lunar samples show a temperature-dependent, low-frequency dispersion that may be due to the combined effect of impurity charges and moisture in the samples that is absorbed from the atmosphere.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB075i032p06524

Craters with diameters between 2 microns and 0.8 mm were observed. Approx. 1 crater larger than 0.15 mm in diameter per 1 mm <SUP>2</SUP> and 1 crater larger than 2 μm per 500 μm <SUP>2</SUP> could be found. The time of exposure is calculated from crater number densities and cosmic dust influx values to be 10 000 yr and 100 yr for layers of respectivethicknesses. On lunar glassy spherules impact features were found which yield the same crater number densities. The phenomenology of high velocity impacts was studies by shooting microspheres on targets similar to lunar material using a 2 MV dust accelerator.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90095-6
