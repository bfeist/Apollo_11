1994GeCoA..58.4795S|1994|Evolution of the upper mantle of the Earth's Moon: Neodymium and strontium isotopic constraints from high-Ti mare basalts|Snyder, Gregory A., Lee, Der-Chuen, Taylor, Lawrence A., Halliday, Alex N., Jerde, Eric A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|21|4795|Isotopic studies of mare basalts have led workers to conclude that their sources are heterogeneous on both large and small scales. Furthermore, these studies have led workers to postulate that depletion within the lunar mantle occurred early in its evolution and was a result of accumulation of mafic minerals from a LREE-enriched magma ocean. High-Ti basalts from the Apollo 11 and 17 landing sites and ilmenite basalts from Apollo 12 are secondary evidence of this extreme, early depletion event. KREEPy rocks are the complementary enriched component in the Moon. A total of fourteen high-Ti basalts have now been analyzed from the Apollo 11 landing site for neodymium and strontium isotopes. A Sm-Nd internal isochron on basalt 10058 yields an age of 3.70 ± 0.06 Ga, similar to <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages of other Group B1 basalts. A compilation of all previously determined ages on Apollo 11 high-Ti basalts indicates four distinct phases of volcanism at 3.85 ± 0.02 Ga (Group B2), 3.71 ± 0.02 Ga (Group B3), 3.67 ± 0.02 Ga (Group B1), and 3.59 ± 0.04 Ga (Group A). Wholerock Sm-Nd isotopic data for all Apollo 11 high-Ti basalts form a linear array, which yields the age of the Moon (4.55 ± 0.30 Ga). A similar regression of all uncontaminated high-Ti basalts from the Moon (both Apollo 11 and Apollo 17) yields an age of 4.46 ± 0.17 Ga. Both arrays are interpreted as average source ages of the high-Ti basalts and are consistent with the formation of these sources by precipitation of cumulates from a magma ocean early in the history of the Moon. These new strontium and neodymium isotopic data, coupled with previously published data, are consistent with a two component model for the upper mantle of the Moon. These two-components include mafic adcumulates precipitated from a magma ocean prior to 4.4 Ga and small amounts (&lt; 2%) of trapped, KREEPy, late-stage, magma ocean differentiates. The mafic adcumulate evolves from 4.5 Ga, with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.318 and <SUP>87</SUP>Rb /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr = 0.005 to extremely radiogenic neodymium isotopic ratios and very unradiogenic strontium isotopic ratios. The KREEPy trapped liquid has a <SUP>147</SUP>Sm /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.168 and <SUP>87</SUP>Rb /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr = 0.235 and thus, evolves toward very unradiogenic neodymium and radiogenic strontium isotopic ratios. Because the KREEPy trapped liquid is enriched in both rubidium and the REEs by over an order of magnitude compared to the mafic adcumulate, trapping of even small proportions of this liquid in the adcumulate will control the radiogenic isotopic composition of the source. The apparent heterogeneity in the source regions of mare basalts could be caused by trapping of variable, yet small, proportions of this LILE-enriched liquid in the cumulate pile.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90209-7
1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|

Specimens in the form of petrographic thin sections were mounted on polarizing microscopes equipped with three-axis universal stage attachments and inserted into a Cary 17 spectrophotometer. The Apollo 11 pyroxenes with relatively high Ti/Fe ratios were chosen initially to investigate the presence of crystal field spectra of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the minerals. Broad intense bands at about 1000 and 2100 nm. arise from spin-allowed, polarization-dependent transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in pyroxenes. Several weak sharp peaks occur in the visible region. Peaks at 402, 425, 505, 550 and 585 nm. represent spin-forbidden transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions, while broader bands at 460 470 nm. and 650 660 nm. are attributed to Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions. Charge transfer bands, which in terrestrial pyroxenes often extend into the visible region, are displaced to shorter wavelengths in lunar pyroxenes. This feature correlates with the absence of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in these minerals. The magnitudes of the intensity ratios: band 465 nm. (Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>) to band 1000 nm. (Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>) are similar to Ti/Fe ratios from lunar pyroxene bulk chemical analyses, suggesting that an appreciable amount of titanium occurs as Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the lunar pyroxenes. The 505 nm. spin-forbidden peak in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, together with absorption at 465 nm. by Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, contribute to the pink or pale reddish-brown colors of lunar pyroxenes in transmitted lights. The absorption spectral measurements not only provide information on the redox behavior and crystal chemistry of lunar pyroxenes, but also form a basis for interpreting spectral reflectivity properties of lunar rocks and the Moon's surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00562917

R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|35|11|1139|Rb-Sr internal isochron ages for three basaltic crystalline rocks from the Ocean of Storms are 300-600 m.y. younger than the ages of basaltic rocks from the Sea of Tranquillity. Rock 12063 has an age of 3.34 ± 0.10AE and [ <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ] <SUB>I</SUB> of 0.69914 ± 3. Internal isochron ages of two separate samples of rock 12004 yield ages of 3.01 ±0.11 and 3.03 ± 0.09AE indicating that this rock is distinctly younger than rock 12063 by about 300 m.y. A relatively imprecise age of 2.92 ± 0.18AE is obtained for rock 12052. The range in ages obtained by us indicate magmatic activity extending over a 300 m.y. period in the Ocean of Storms. Initial Sr compositions for the three rocks are distinctly higher than BABI value and provide evidence for the extreme alkali depletion in the source areas of these basalts, as also indicated by the trace element data. The differences in the initial Sr compositions and ages suggest that these lavas are produced from different source materials. An internal isochron age of 3.63 ± 0.11AE and a [ <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ] <SUB>I</SUB> of 0.69903 ± 5 has been obtained on the Apollo 11 Sample 10058. Model ages for the soil samples 12033 and 12070 are 4.3AE and 4.6AE respectively. The different model ages and the abundances of K, Rb, Sr and Ba in the soils indicate the heterogeneous nature and lack of mixing in the soils. The soils are highly radiogenic compared to the rocks. Both the trace element data and the Sr-isotopic data from leaching experiments show that the soil is not simply derived from the mare basalts, but contains a highly radiogenic and K, Rb, Ba rich component similar in composition to rock 12013. We infer that this exotic component is more ubiquitous on the lunar surface than present sampling indicates.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(71)90030-5
