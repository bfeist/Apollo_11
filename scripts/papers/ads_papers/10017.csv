2013AGUSMGP24A..05F|2013|Lunar Paleomagnetism|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2013||GP24A-05|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.|

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2012||GP51B-03|Apollo-era paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples suggested that the Moon generated an ancient core dynamo. However, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field was unclear. One group proposed that the lunar dynamo ceased by 3.6 Ga, and that all paleointensity determinations from younger samples were indistinguishable from zero (Cisowski and Fuller, 1986). A second group proposed that the lunar dynamo persisted to at least 3.1 Ga, but surface field intensities declined to values 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those during the period of 3.9-3.65 Ga (Runcorn, 1996). Recent re-analysis of samples 76535, 10020, and 10017 confirm that a lunar core dynamo generated a long-lived, stable magnetic field from 4.2 Ga to at least 3.6 Ga, with ~ 70 μT fields at 3.6-3.7 Ga (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009; Shea et al., 2012; Suavet et al., 2012). Determining when the dynamo ultimately decayed is difficult because retrieving high-fidelity paleointensities for weak fields is difficult for the vast majority of lunar samples due to their poor magnetic recording properties (Tikoo et al., 2012). Thus far, no lunar samples with ages &lt; 3.6 Ga have been reported which unambiguously record a thermoremanence (TRM) acquired while cooling in the presence of a core dynamo-generated field. We investigated the state of the lunar dynamo after 3.6 Ga by studying the natural remanent magnetization of high magnetic fidelity mare basalts 15597 (~ 3.3 Ga) and 12022 (~ 3.2 Ga). Our alternating field and thermal demagnetization as well as rock magnetic data indicate that, by 3.2 Ga, any surface fields on the Moon were too weak (&lt; 7 μT) to be retrieved by our methods. Because our upper limit of 7 μT is consistent with predictions of dynamo scaling laws, it is possible that the lunar dynamo was still active at 3.2 Ga (Dwyer et al., 2011; LeBars et al., 2011). Nevertheless. such weak fields contrast strongly with the 60-70 μT paleointensities inferred for the Moon just 300-400 million years earlier. Furthermore, although Apollo-era paleointensity compilations have identified lunar paleofields ranging from 0.1-10 μT at 3.3 Ga to &lt;200 Ma, we have recently shown that many or all of these values are likely only upper limits (Tikoo et al. 2012).|

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||GP11B-04|Following the Apollo missions, twenty years of paleomagnetic studies of returned samples have failed to demonstrate unambiguously the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. As a result of new technologies, more robust analytical methods, and a better understanding of rock magnetism, it is now possible to revisit lunar paleomagnetism. A set of criteria that must be met in order to demonstrate that a sample has recorded a core dynamo field has been defined: the samples must not show petrologic evidence of shock, the magnetization must be a stable thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), mutually oriented subsamples should agree in direction and intensity, and the thermal history should be well constrained, with a cooling timescale longer than the lifetime of impact generated fields (&gt;1h). A critical review of the literature has allowed us to identify Apollo samples that are most likely to provide good records of ancient lunar magnetic fields. The first samples to be studied within this framework were troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009) and mare basalt 10020 (Shea et al., 2010), which have recorded a core dynamo field at 4.2 and 3.7 Ga, respectively. Mare basalt 10017 is a fine grained, vesicular, high-K ilmenite basalt with a crystallization age of 3.6 Ga. It was studied by different groups (Fuller and Meshkov, 1979; Hoffman et al., 1979; Runcorn et al., 1970; Stephenson et al., 1977), all of whom noted the stability of its magnetization. We have measured 7 subsamples of chip 10017,378. Their magnetizations agree in direction, with a low coercivity overprint removed by 10 mT AF demagnetization, and a stable high coercivity component consistent with a TRM. Paleointensity estimations give a conservative minimum of 12 μT for the paleofield. This sample is ~100 Myr younger than the end of the late heavy bombardment, which rules out basin-forming impacts as a possible candidate to explain its magnetization. It extends the lifetime of the putative ancient lunar core dynamo well after thermal convection of the liquid core could have sustained an Earth-like lunar dynamo, thereby supporting non-standard dynamo scenarios such as a mechanical-stirring driven dynamo that could have been triggered by lunar librations from Earth tides or by impacts.|

P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||P13D-1696|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis.

It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498.

These cross sections were used to calculate galactic-cosmic-ray and solar-proton production rates for Kr isotopes in the moon. The paper reports spallation Kr data obtained from ilmenite separates of rocks 10017 and 10047. Production rates and isotopic ratios for cosmogenic Kr observed in ten well-documented lunar samples and in ilmenite separates and bulk samples from several lunar rocks with long but unknown irradiation histories were compared with predicted rates and ratios. The agreements were generally quite good.|

Whole rock K/Ar ages of rocks 10017 and 10071 are (2350 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (2880 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr, respectively. The two feldspar concentrates of rock 10071 have distinctly higher ages: (3260 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (3350 ± 70) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr. These ages are still 10 per cent lower than the Rb/Sr age obtained by PAPANASTASSIOUet al. (1970) and some Ar <SUP>40</SUP> diffusion loss must have occurred even in the relatively coarse-grained feldspar. The relative abundance patterns of spallation Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe are in agreement with the ratios predicted from meteoritic production rates. However, diffusion loss of spallation He <SUP>3</SUP> is evident in the whole rock samples, and even more in the feldspar concentrates. The ilmenite shows little or no diffusion loss. The isotopic composition of spallation Kr and Xe is similar to the one observed in meteorites. Small, systematic differences in the spallation Kr spectra of rocks 10017 and 10071 are due to variations in the irradiation hardness (shielding). The Kr spallation spectra in the mineral concentrates are different from the whole rock spectra and also show individual variations, reflecting the differences in target element composition. The relative abundance of cosmic ray produced Xe <SUP>131</SUP> differs by nearly 50 per cent in the two rocks. The other Xe isotopes show no variations of similar magnitude. The origin of the Xe <SUP>131</SUP> yield variability is discussed. Kr <SUP>81</SUP> was measured in all the samples investigated. The Kr <SUP>81</SUP>/Kr exposure ages of rocks 10017 and 10071 are (480 ± 25) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (350 ± 15) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr, respectively. Exposure ages derived from spallation Ne <SUP>21</SUP>, Ar <SUP>38</SUP>, Kr <SUP>83</SUP> and Xe <SUP>126</SUP> are essentially in agreement with the Kr <SUP>81</SUP>/Kr ages. The age of rock 10071 might be somewhat low because of a possible recent exposure of our sample to solar flare particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(74)90197-5

Unfortunately, the data concern chiefly the measurements of medium radioactivity of whole rock (by non-destructive gamma-spectrometry) or large volume samples (by radiochemical methods). The data provide no way to determine the overall depth distribution gradient of radionuclides, produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays, and so no information can be extracted about the intensity of cosmic rays. But ref. 1 describes how the radioactivities of some radionuclides have been measured as a function of depth in lunar sample 10,017.

R.|Journal of Geophysical Research|75|32|6553|Heat-capacity measurements have been made on portions of lunar rocks 10017 and 10046 in the temperature region 2° to 5°K. For both specimens, the heat capacity is over 100 times greater than is predicted from acoustic wave velocities measured in the same rocks. Several possible reasons for this behavior are considered. It is concluded that the effect originates in the existence of one or more small peaks in the low-frequency part of the vibrational frequency distribution. The ‘excess’ heat capacity of rock 10017 can be accounted for semiquantitatively by one such peak containing 3% of the normal modes at a frequency of 5 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. Thermal equilibration in rock 10046 was sufficiently slow to allow a good estimate to be made of its thermal conductivity. The result, K = 2.5(±0.5) × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> cal/sec cm deg, is compared with values obtained by using other experimental techniques. The thermal conductivity of rock 10017 was found to be 10 to 100 times larger.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB075i032p06553
