A model study to simulate the polycrystalline spectra has been carried out, from which it was possible to ascertain with some degree of certainty the size and shape of the ferromagnetic centers as well as the metallic iron content. Some variations in the metallic Fe content have been noted in these samples, for example, between rocks and fine soil.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(71)90001-9
