1971E&PSL..11...37P|1971|Lunar chronology and evolution from Rb sbnd Sr studies of Apollo 11 and 12 samples|Papanastassiou, D. A., Wasserburg, G. J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|11|1|37|Rb-Sr internal isochrons for a total of eight Apollo 12 crystalline rocks yield ages of 3.36 to 3.16 AE. The initial Sr compositions ( I) are relatively primitive and range from 0.69918 to 0.69957 as compared to BABI= 0.69898 ± 3. No clear groupings in I are observed, however, the wide range indicates that at least four different rock bodies were sampled. An Apollo 11 basalt (10024) yielded an age of 3.61 ± 0.07AE andI = 0.69935 ∓ 8 in agreement with previous results on other Apollo 11 high K rocks. Several Apollo 12 soil samples yield model ages which range from 4.4 to 4.6 AE and indicate that the special nature and older "age" of the lunar soil determined at the Apollo 11 site is a widespread phenomenon. Initial Sr compositions from Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 support our previous conclusions that the moon as a whole has a Rb/Sr much lower ( Rb/Sr≈ 0.008) than found in chondrites. We summarize the current status of Rb sbnd Sr lunar chronology and some implications regarding the melting and differentiation history of the moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90139-7
