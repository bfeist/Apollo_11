D., Raut, U., Karnes, P. L., Poston, M., Wyrick, D. Y.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P51D-2916|The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has found evidence of water frost inside permanently shaded regions (PSR's) of craters on the Moon. These results have increased the scientific community's interest in developing technology to harness water ice on the Moon as a resource. Understanding how lunar simulants adsorb water ice will be crucial to the development of this new technology, especially when medium to large sample sizes are required. While JSC-1A is the favored lunar simulant, its lack of np-Fe and differences in grain size distribution could affect the surface area/activation sites available for water frost adsorption on the grains. Far-UV reflectance spectra of the JSC-1A will be taken in the Southwest Ultraviolet Reflectance Chamber (SwURC). After the dry far-UV reflectance spectra are taken, soil samples will be coated with a thin layer of ice, using a micro-capillary doser. The final reflectance spectra will be calculated using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). We investigate the dry reflected far-UV spectra of the JSC-1A and compare to the reflectance spectra of the Apollo lunar soils 10084 and 15041. In addition, preliminary results for the far-UV reflectance spectra of ice coated lunar simulant will also be discussed. Both the dry and ice coated spectra of the JSC-1A simulant will serve as resource to help scientists better understand the differences between the ice coated JSC-1A lunar simulant and the icy lunar soils that will be encountered by future crewed missions to the Moon.|

D., Orlando, Thomas M.|Geophysical Research Letters|45|20|10,959|The solar wind has been implicated as a source of water on airless bodies such as the Moon, asteroids, and possibly Mercury, yet a kinetic and mechanistic chemical model consistent with present-day observational data is still lacking. Utilizing available data sets on temperature-driven water formation and desorption from metal oxides (e.g., SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) with surface hydroxyl defects (-OH) and experimental data from a lunar mare regolith Apollo sample (10084), the 2.8-μm optical signal on the Moon is modeled. Specifically, the presence and persistence of this band result from the balance of formation and loss mechanisms associated with solar wind production and thermal transformation of hydroxyls on and within the regolith. This cycle involves formation and release of molecular water via recombinative desorption of the chemically bound -OH. Though this mechanism forms gas-phase H<SUB>2</SUB>O on the sunlit side, photodissociation and dissociative adsorption lead to rehydroxylation and very limited exospheric water over a lunation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080008

The bidirectional reflectance distribution function of this mare soil, enriched in Ti and Fe content, is rather featureless in the FUV wavelength region of 115-180 nm, except for a small blue slope, which is attributed to the effects of space weathering. This soil preferentially backscatters FUV photons as indicated by the angular distribution of the bidirectional reflectance. The phase curves are fitted with a simplified Hapke photometric model to derive the average volume single scattering albedo and scattering phase function of the mare lunar grains. The albedo values and the backscattering nature reported here are consistent with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project ultraviolet imaging spectrograph observations, despite expected morphological differences.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JE005567

We find the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to be featureless in this wavelength region, though with a small blue slope. The angular distribution of the BRDF at Ly-α and 160 nm shows that this mature mare soil, containing nanophase Fe and enriched in Ti, anisotropically scatters light in the forward direction. The phase angle dependence of the BRDF is fitted with Hapke's photometric model with an additional diffuse-directional term. Future plans include measurements of mare and highland soils of differing maturity index (Is/FeO), water ice frost and lunar soil-ice aggregates. Such measurements will help constrain the abundance and distribution of the water ice on the illuminated lunar surface and dark permanently shadowed regions of the moon, as reported by LRO-LAMP.|

A.|Icarus|255||51|Low energy secondary ions ejected by the solar wind are an important component of tenuous exospheres surrounding airless bodies, since these ions carry information on the planetary surface composition. In this work we examine the dependence of secondary-ion abundance, as a function of energy and mass, on surface composition. The surface compositions of two Apollo soils (10084 and 62231) and a synthetic Corning glass lunar simulant were measured with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and correlated with the spectra of secondary-ions ejected from the same soils by 4 keV He ions. XPS spectra for lunar soils show that the surface compositions are similar to the bulk, but enriched in Fe and O, while depleted in Mg and Ca. 4 keV He irradiation on the lunar soils and a glass simulant preferentially removes O and Si, enriching the surface in Al, Ti, Mg, and Ca. Secondary-ion species ejected from the Apollo soils by 4 keV He include: Na<SUP>+</SUP>, Mg<SUP>+</SUP>, Al<SUP>+</SUP>, Si<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>++</SUP>, Ti<SUP>+</SUP>, Fe<SUP>+</SUP>, and molecular species: NaO<SUP>+</SUP>, MgO<SUP>+</SUP> and SiO<SUP>+</SUP>. Secondary ion energy distributions for lunar soil 10084 and 62231 rise rapidly, reach a maxima at ∼5 eV for molecular ions and Na<SUP>+</SUP>, ∼7.5 eV for Fe<SUP>+</SUP>, and ∼10 eV for Mg<SUP>+</SUP>, Al<SUP>+</SUP>, Si<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>+</SUP> and Ti<SUP>+</SUP>, then decrease slowly with energy.

E., Allen, C., Pieters, C. M., Paige, D. A.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2014||P13D-3841|The Diviner Lunar Radiometer, onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, has produced the first global, high resolution, thermal infrared observations of an airless body. The Moon, which is the most accessible member of this most abundant class of solar system objects, is also the only body for which we have extraterrestrial samples with known spatial context. Here we present the results of a comprehensive study to reproduce an accurate simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with Diviner observations of the lunar surface. It has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions. The data presented here were collected at the University of Oxford Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC). In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (&lt;10-4 mbar) sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber with liquid nitrogen to simulate radiation to the cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples with heaters and lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. A comprehensive suite of experiments were conducted using different sample preparation and heating conditions on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) and compared the results to Diviner noontime data to select the optimal experimental conditions. Additional thermal infrared measurements in optimized SLE were made of 10084 (A11 - LM), 12001 (A12 - LM), 14259 (A14 - LM), 15071 (A15 - S1), 15601 (A15 - S9a), 61141 (A16 - S1), 66031 (A16 - S6), 67701 (A16 - S11), and 70181 (A17 - LM).The Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. We find that analyses of Diviner observations of individual sampling stations and SLE measurements of returned Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal infrared reflectance under terrestrial conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates the Diviner compositional dataset.|

The chamber provides laboratory-based UV reflectance measurements of water frost/ice, lunar soils, simulants, and analogs to support interpretation of UV reflectance data from the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). A deuterium lamp illuminates a monochromator with a nominal wavelength range of 115 nm to 210 nm. The detector scans emission angles -85° to +85°in the principal plane. Liquid nitrogen passed through the sample mount enables constant refrigeration of tray temperatures down to 78 K to form water ice and other volatile samples. The SwURC can be configured to examine a wide range of samples and materials through the use of custom removable sample trays, connectors, and holders.

However, additional work is needed to fully evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation. Such work would help ongoing efforts to improve TiO<SUB>2</SUB> mapping (e.g., as currently underway with LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) data). To evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation, we are investigating soil petrographic factors (e.g., modal abundances of Ti bearing minerals, lithic, and glass hosts, ilmenite morphology, grain size, and maturity) that may influence the spectra. This “ground truth” approach will be useful in comparing between sample information and laboratory spectra to investigate the influence of petrographic factors on the spectra. In this work, we report the quantitative results of a systematic laboratory investigation of three size fractions (210-100 μm, 100-48 μm, 48-20 μm) of two high Ti lunar soils 10084 and 71501 using a combined digital imaging (backscattered electron image and X-ray maps) method. For each size fraction, the results include: (1) the modal abundances for single phase minerals and lithologic components; (2) the Ti distributions among Ti host components; and (3) the shape of ilmenite grains. We compile and compare the data together for the three size fractions of the two high Ti soils with different maturities as well as data from previous studies. Future work will include the investigation of finer size fractions (&lt;20 μm) and more samples (Apollo 12, Apollo 15) covering a larger range of Ti concentration and maturity, and comparison with their spectra.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.07.007

R., Biggar, S. F., Greenhagen, B. T., Allen, C.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||P53A-1499|We have compared laboratory solar reflectance measurements of Apollo 11 and 16 soil samples to Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner orbital albedo measurements at the Apollo landing sites. The soil samples are two representative end member samples from the moon, low albedo lunar maria (sample 10084) and high albedo lunar highlands (sample 68810). Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements of the soil samples were conducted at Bloomsburg University (BUG) and at the University of Arizona [1,2]. We collected two different types of BUG datasets: a standard set of BRDF measurements at incidence angles of 0-60°, emission angles of 0-80°, and phase angles of 3-140°, and a high-incidence angle set of measurements along and perpendicular to the principal plane at incidence angles of 0-75° and phase angles of 3-155°. The BUG measurements generated a total of 765 data points in four different filters 450, 550, 750 and 950 nm. The Blacklab measurements were acquired at incidence angles of 60-88°, emission angles 60-82°, and phase angles of 17-93° at wavelengths of 455, 554, 699, 949nm. The BUG data were fit to two BRDF models: Hapke’s model [3] as described by Johnson et al, 2010 [4], and a simplified empirical function. The fact that both approaches can satisfactorily fit the BUG data is not unexpected, given the similarities between the functions and their input parameters, and the fact that the BRDF for dark lunar soil is dominated by the single scattering phase functions of the individual soil particles. To compare our lunar sample measurements with LRO Diviner data [5], we selected all daytime observations acquired during the first year of operation within 3 km square boxes centered at the landing sites. We compared Diviner Channel 1 (0.3 - 3 µm) Lambert albedos with model calculated Lambert albedos of the lunar samples at the same photometric angles. In general, we found good agreement between the laboratory and Diviner measurements, particularly at intermediate incidence angles. We are currently reconciling any differences observed between our two datasets to provide mutual validation, and to better understand the Diviner solar reflectance measurements in terms of lunar regolith properties.

M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||P53A-1498|Laboratory visible/near-infrared multispectral goniometer observations of Apollo 16 mature highland soil 68810,2 were acquired using the Bloomsburg University Goniometer (BUG) [1]. These data provided constraints on Hapke radiative transfer models for comparison to model results from similar BUG data acquired of Apollo 11 soil 10084 [2]. Such data are relevant to analyses of lunar surface observations acquired by orbital cameras and spectrometers flown on past and present lunar missions. Standard BUG measurements were acquired (incidence 0-60°, emission 0-80°, and phase 3-140°) comprising 680 measurements per wavelength. We acquired multispectral measurements of the 68810 sample at 450, 550 ,700, 750, 850, and 950 nm. We also supplemented this geometric coverage by constructing an elongated sample holder for measurements in and perpendicular to the principal plane. These measurements were acquired at 450, 550, 750, and 950 nm, and allowed expanded geometric coverage to incidence angles of 0-75° and phase angles of 3-155°, comprising 765 measurements per wavelength. Hapke radiative transfer models were run using 1-term and 2-term Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase functions to determine photometric properties such as single scattering albedo and backscattering behavior. The results show little difference in the photometric parameters between model runs using the standard and expanded data sets. Models of the 68810 highland sample exhibit higher single scattering albedo (by ~66%) than the 10084 mare sample models, consistent with modeling of Clementine and other remote sensing observations [e.g., 3]. The 68810 soil is also slightly more broadly backscattering (in both 1-term and 2-term HG models), with properties similar to results from laboratory analyses of agglutinates and rough, clear spheres. Both Apollo soils are more backscattering than any lunar analog soil yet measured [2]. The opposition effect width h (compaction parameter) is slightly smaller for the 68810 highland soil (h=0.031), suggesting a less uniform average grain size and/or more porous soil than the 10084 mare soil (h=0.040). This is consistent with the comparison of highland and mare regions from [4].

2009AGUSM.V74B..04N|2009|Lunar Magmatic Volatiles|Nekvasil, H., McCubbin, F. M., Lindsley, D. H.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2009||V74B-04|Samples returned from the Apollo Missions prompted a variety of experimental investigations (e.g., [1-4]) which form the basis of our current understanding of lunar compositional evolution. The observed low abundances of solidus temperature-suppressing volatiles justified volatile-free experiments. However, the low-pressure nature of the samples makes it unlikely that volatiles were retained during magma ascent and eruption. In an effort to re-assess the lunar mantle volatile budget, we are focusing on the mineral apatite because of its incorporation of F, Cl, and OH as essential structural constituents and its greater ability to retain such volatiles relative to melt. Apatite grains analyzed from magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks (14161,7111, 14161,7269 and 14161,7264), KREEPy impact melt rocks associated with magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks (14161,7233; 14161,7110; 14161,7062; 12033,634-25; SaU 169-4), and mare basalts (79195; 12037,224; 74246; 12023,147,1; 10084; LAP 02205; LAP 03632; NWA 2977) by electron microprobe using the technique of [5,6] show two distinct compositional groups. Apatite from the mare basalts analyzed are primarily mixtures of fluor- "missing component" (OH?) apatite with low Cl abundance, while that from the magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks are fluor-chlor mixtures. Apatite/basaltic melt partition coefficients for F, Cl, and H2O from the data of [7] provide first estimates of magmatic volatile abundances in lunar magmas. They suggest that magmatic water may have been more abundant than F and Cl at the stage of apatite crystallization in mare basalts. In contrast, at this stage, the magmas that produced the Mg-and alkali suite minerals were F- and Cl-dominated. These results have wide-reaching implications regarding the chemical and physical evolution of the Moon and therefore, the next generation of experimental investigations.

R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P31E|The Moon has a complex three-dimensional shape with significant large-scale and small-scale topographic relief. The Moon’s topography largely controls the distribution of incident solar radiation, as well as the scattered solar and infrared radiation fields. Topography also affects the Moon’s interaction with the space environment, its magnetic field, and the propagation of seismic waves. As more extensive and detailed lunar datasets become available, there is an increasing need to interpret and compare them with the results of physical models in a fully three-dimensional context. We have developed a three-dimensional framework for lunar modeling we call the Digital Moon. The goal of this work is to enable high fidelity physical modeling and visualization of the Moon in a parallel computing environment. The surface of the Moon is described by a continuous triangular mesh of arbitrary shape and spatial scale. For regions of limited geographic extent, it is convenient to employ meshes on a rectilinear grid. However for global-scale modeling, we employ a continuous geodesic gridding scheme (Teanby, 2008). Each element in the mesh surface is allowed to have a unique set of physical properties. Photon and particle interactions between mesh elements are modeled using efficient ray tracing algorithms. Heat, mass, photon and particle transfer within each mesh element are modeled in one dimension. Each compute node is assigned a portion of the mesh and collective interactions between elements are handled through network interfaces. We have used the model to calculate lunar surface and subsurface temperatures that can be compared directly with radiometric temperatures measured by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The model includes realistic surface photometric functions based on goniometric measurements of lunar soil samples (Foote and Paige, 2009), and one-dimensional thermal models based on lunar remote sensing and Apollo heat flow measurements (Vasavada et al., 1999; Siegler et al., this meeting). Using the latest available topographic data, the results of the model are in excellent qualitative agreement with the Diviner measurements and we are in the process of refining input parameters to obtain better quantitative agreements. Other near-term applications for the model include visualizing the LCROSS impact event for Earth-based observers, modeling the fluxes of thermal and epithermal neutrons observed by Lunar Prospector, and adapting the model to other airless bodies.

B.|Journal of Geophysical Research (Planets)|113|E2|E02003|We examine the ability of a radiative transfer model based on the theory of Hapke (1981, 1993, 2001) to reproduce reflectance spectra of known composition, as well as extract compositional information from reflectance spectra. We test this model using spectra of two-component mineral mixtures, spectra of lunar mare soils studied by the Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium (LSCC), and a telescopic spectrum of the Apollo 11 landing site. The model is able to accurately reproduce spectra of two-component mineral mixtures and can be used to accurately predict mineral abundances, mineral chemistry, and particle size. Reflectance spectra of the lunar mare soils are modeled using the mineral abundances and chemistries reported for each soil. We collect our own mineral and chemical information for one of these samples, 12001, in order to examine the effects of several simplifying assumptions employed by the LSCC and conclude that the classification of glass (volcanic/impact versus agglutinitic) can have large consequences on the predicted spectra. Model spectra can generally mimic the lunar mare sample spectra, though with consistent errors in contrast and continuum slope, and absorption bands offset to shorter wavelengths. The Apollo 11 telescopic spectrum is successfully modeled with mineralogy and chemistry from sample 10084, though the fit is improved with slight variations in mineralogy or mineral chemistry. We find that varying pyroxene chemistry can have as large an effect on spectral shape as varying mineral abundance.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JE002929

S.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|1|177|Soil 10084 is the only representative soil sample from Apollo 11 and arguably one of the purest mare soils in the Apollo collection. It was wet sieved in 1970 and dry sieved in 1971 with different results. Therefore, some doubt about its grain size distribution persists. We consider allocation inhomogeneity, if any, to be a minor cause for the discrepancy. Rather, the difference in methodology is likely to be the major cause for different results. We report the results of a new analysis of an allocation of 0.99 g using the contemporary method of wet sieving at JSC; this method uses water instead of freon. Our results show that the mean grain size and sorting of the submillimeter fraction of soil 10084 are 4.28 theta (= 51 μm) and 2.23 theta (= 213 μm), respectively. A significant proportion (14.2%) of the soil is in the &lt;10 μm size range, which contrasts to previous determinations of 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively. The newly determined grain size distribution is skewed towards the finest grain sizes. This result is more compatible with the high maturity of this soil than the results of previous determinations.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2001.tb01818.x

J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2

The rims have a thin outer sublayer 10-50 nm thick that contains the ilmenite-incompatible elements Si, Al, Ca and S. This overlies a relatively thicker (50-250 nm) inner sublayer of nanocrystalline Ti-oxide precipitates in a matrix of single-crystal ilmenite that is structurally continuous with the underlying host grain. Microstructural information, as well as data from x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) analysis of the inner sublayer, suggest that both the inner and outer sublayer assemblages are reduced and that the inner layer is depleted in Fe relative to the underlying ilmenite. The chemistry of the outer sublayer suggests that it is a surface deposit of sputtered or impact-vaporized components from the bulk lunar soil. The inner sublayer is part of the original host grain that has been physically and chemically processed, but not amorphized, by solar ion irradiation and possibly some subsolidus heating. The fact that the deposited outer sublayer is consistently much thinner than the radiation-altered inner sublayer indicates that only a minor fraction of the total rim volume is a product of vapor or sputter deposition. This finding is in contrast to recent descriptions of thick deposited layers on one-third of regolith silicate grains and indicates that ilmenite and silicate rims as a group are different in the fraction of deposited material that they contain.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1996.tb02117.x

Similar spectra were acquired for size separates for Apollo 11 soil 10084. The finest fraction dominates both the visible and the midIR. Apollo 16 soils exhibit the shortest Christiansen Frequency (CF), a trend consistent with their feldspathic character. Finer soil size fractions, however, are observed to have longer CF, perhaps due to the effective strength of the Reststrahlen bands (RB). Altogether, features in the near-infrared are currently the most readily interpreted in terms of mineral composition and space weathering effects.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|87||260|It has been known for some time that the part of the lunar regolith smaller than 10 micrometers (&lt;10 μm) is chemically distinct from the bulk soil. Specifically, it is enriched in Al, Ca, Na, K, light rare earth elements, and Th, and depleted in Mg, Fe, Mn, and Sc. Three models have been proposed to explain those systematics. The Exotic Component model holds that a fine-grained, KREEPy exotic component was distributed on a global scale, perhaps by the Imbrian impact. In the Simple Comminution model, the &lt;10 μm chemical systematics are due to differential comminution processes with fine-grained melt-rock mesostasis and feldspar concentrating in this fraction. The Soil Mixing model states that the chemical systematics are due to mixing of compositionally distinct soils that have different grain-size distributions. To determine which model is correct, modal petrographic data were obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X ray analysis for the &lt;10 μm fractions of four Apollo soils: 10084, 14163, 15271, and 64501. Modal results are consistent with chemical data regarding feldspathic and KREEP enrichments in the finest fraction. Soil glass contents, crystalline silica, and plagioclase/mafic mineral ratios are greater in the &lt;10 μm fraction than in the coarser fractions for all soils. Grain-size distributions are inconsistent with a fine-grained exotic component derived from distant sources. Comminution of local lithologies, vertical mixing, and local lateral transport control the &lt;10 μm soil composition.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB087iS01p0A260

Grain size-ordinate intercept analysis is applied to bulk soil, ilmenite, and plagioclase separates obtained from 1 mm or smaller fines sample 10084,48. K-Ar ages for ilmenite, plagioclase, and total soil separates are determined to be 2.80, 3.38 and 4.00 AE, respectively. It appears that 10084,48 may consist primarily of two components. In this view, the first is locally derived, forms 65-75% of the present day regolith and may show that a local degassing event(s) occurred between 2.8 and 3.5 AE ago. The second component is similar to material from the lunar highlands. It may be local or foreign in origin and contributes the remaining 25-35% of the soil. This component exhibits an age of 4.00 AE and is either slightly older than, or contemporaneous with, the oldest of the returned Apollo 11 basalts. Within the limits of experimental error, the trapped Ar-38/Ar-36 ratio is constant at 0.1890 for all the soil components examined.|

A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|2|206|Forty-two elements have been measured via INAA and RNAA in six samples of five rocks from a 2-m tan-gray boulder-2 breccia (South Massif), in four soils from the South Massif and a valley soil. The chemical composition of the four metaclastic rocks corresponds to "high alumina" (52% Pl) and medium-K KREEP-type rocks. Rock 72335,2 is a medium K anorthositic gabbro (74% Pl). Both the North and South Massifs appear to be medium-K KREEP in composition and thus may represent a single stratigraphic unit of the Serenitatis basin event. Four soils of the South Massif are identical in composition to medium-K KREEP; they are more feldspathic and lower in LIL trace elements relative to the boulder-2 rocks. The valley soil 75081 is like the 10084 soil; both soils are high in TiO <SUB>2</SUB> and both are deficient in KREEP. Th and U give a sharp distinction between the valley and highland soils. The South Massif rocks and soils contain siderophiles at the 2-4% Cl level and show an ancient meteoritic pattern. Five samples of the four rocks have Ir/Au ratios of ± 0.02 which we assign to the Serenitatis basis planetesimal. The valley soil at Camelot Crater has low siderophiles (1% Cl). Our systematic study of four shadowed and exposed soils does not support the labile hypothesis for Cd, In, Tl and Zn. We observe no volatile (atmophile) movement from the South Massif highland soils to the valley soil 75081. The volatiles Cs and Tl appear to have been fractionated in the boulder-2 rocks during cratering, brecciation and metamorphic processes. The uniform ratio of FeO/MnO = 80-85, observed for all previous mare and highland sites, also holds for the Taurus-Littrow site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90195-2

The two size fractions between 125 and 250 μm as well as 250 and 500 μm were separated into magnetic and non-magnetic portions, which were measured separately. Like the Apollo and Luna 16 fines, the terra fines represented by Luna 20 are very rich in trapped solar-wind gases, but they contain relatively less He <SUP>4</SUP> and Ne <SUP>20</SUP>, which is revealed by their average He <SUP>4</SUP>/Ne <SUP>20</SUP> ratio of 35 and Ne <SUP>20</SUP>/Ar <SUP>36</SUP> ratio of 2.9. Obviously the terra materials are less retentive for solar-wind He and Ne than typical mare fines such as 10084.

The relatively small emanation rates could be due to the absence of interstitial air and water on the lunar surface as has been suggested by Lindstrom et al. [5].

These gradients usually extend over 25-30 μ. Furthermore, the natural surfaces of 11 unpolished glass spherules separated from the fines 10084,97, in 60-80% of all cases, show higher concentrations in Na <SUB>2</SUB>O, K <SUB>2</SUB>O, and P <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>5</SUB> than the averages for the central portions of 45 independently analyzed glass spherules. It is suggested that the concentration gradients observed are diffusion gradients and are the result of the impact event which produced the glasses: in the impact melting process, splash drops of melt formed that lost volatiles by vaporization. If the impact-produced vapor cloud surrounding the freely-floating spherules was large enough, then partial condensation of the volatile elements in the vapor cloud should take place upon cooling. These volatile elements condensed on the relatively hot spherules, and thermal diffusion of Na, K and P from the spherule surfaces towards their interiors occurred. Depending upon the temperature, cooling rate, and diffusion coefficient for the particular spherule composition, concentration gradients of different steepness and width should originate. A procedure is described to determine the cooling rate of a spherule from measured concentration gradients, provided the diffusion coefficients are known for the particular glass compositions in question.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(72)90071-4

Such interactions give rise to the possibility that a compositionally distinct component exists in lunar (also in meteorites) xenon. This component is different from the galactic cosmic ray induced component which in general is produced by the emission of several nucleons. In case of radioactive and stable nuclides, it was shown<SUP>1-3</SUP> that the isotope production by solar cosmic rays in the near surface regions of lunar rocks is limited to the top few millimetres while at greater depths the galactic cosmic rays play the major role.

The abundance patterns of Li, Be and B in the different soil samples are remarkably similar although the concentrations vary by a factor of four to eight being lowest in the Luna 16 sample and highest in the fines from Apollo 14. A strong correlation of Li, B and K was found for the soil samples collected at the four sites. Within larger experimental errors Be is also correlated with these elements. Lunar abundances of Li, Be and B are in good agreement with those in the terrestrial standard basalt BCR-1. Relative to basaltic achondrites and, in particular, relative to chondrites, lunar Li, Be and B are enriched by a factor of up to 100. The Li, Be and B concentrations in the Apollo 12 fines are enriched by factors of three to five relative to the average concentrations reported for the Apollo 12 basalts. This enrichment most probably is caused by the same additional component in the fines which is responsible for the three to four-fold excess of K, rare earth elements and P (KREEP) relative to the basalts returned from the Ocean of Storms. It is shown that the fines from Apollo 12 and 14 can be related to each other by a two-component mixing model, one end member being the Apollo 12 basalts, the other one the fine sample 14141 whose chemical composition seems to very similar to that of the KREEP component.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90211-1

J.|Science|167|3918|628|Single-crystal x-ray diffraction, microprobe, optical and electron optical examinations of clinopyroxenes from Apollo 11 lunar samples 10003, 10047, 10050, and 10084 show that generally the crystals are composed of (001) augite-pigeonite intergrowths in varying ratios. Transmission electron micrographs reveal abundant exsolution lamellae, many only 60 Å thick. In addition to the phase inhomogeneities, primary chemical inhomogeneities are clearly demonstrated. There are reciprocal relationships between calcium and iron and between Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> + 2Al and R<SUP>2+</SUP> + 2Si. Our evidence suggests that a chemically inhomogeneous subcalcic C2/c augite was the only primary pyroxene from which pigeonite later exsolved.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.628

H.|Science|167|3918|530|Chemical and emission spectrographic analyses of three Apollo 11 samples, 10017-29, 10020-30, and 10084-132, are given. Major and minor constituents were determined both by conventional rock analysis methods and by a new composite scheme utilizing a lithium fluoborate method for dissolution of the samples and atomic absorption spectroscopy and colorimetry. Trace constituents were determined by optical emission spectroscopy involving a d-c arc, air-jet controlled.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.530

C., Durrieu, L., Jouret, C., Maurette, M.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|9|5|391|Some habit and texture features of the finest and uncrushed grains in the lunar dust samples 10084 and 12070, were studied with the 1 MeV electron microscope of the Institut d'Optique Electronique du C.N.R.S., Toulouse, France. These features were then compared with those observed in broken fragments extracted either from lunar rocks 10047 and 12063 or from different types of meteorites (Orgueil; Pesyanoe, Shergotty). The finest fraction of the Apollo 11 lunar soil samples is constituted of about 80% of well ordered but rounded crystals which are frequently overlaid by a thin skin of amorphous material. In the Apollo 12 soil the grains are coarser, the fraction of crystalline material is higher (̃90%) and the proportion of crystals showing an amorphous skin is smaller, but both lunar soil samples are very different from meteoritic or lunar rock matter. Some implications of the present results concerning the fabric of the finest fraction of the lunar regolith, the ancient solar wind and meteoritic research are briefly outlined.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90003-8
