It also enables more accurate scattering functions to be set within 3D thermal modelsi.e. the Oxford 3D Thermal Model (O3DTM)thus potentially improving the match between modelled surface temperatures and remote sensing measurements from thermal infrared (TIR) instruments, such as the Diviner Lunar Radiometer [2, 3]. At Oxford, a suite of BRDFs have been measured using the Visible Oxford Space Environment Goniometer (VOSEG), for Apollo regolith samples 10084 and 68810 with a range of porosity and RMS slope angle values (measured across 10-1000m size-scales) [4, 5, 6]. BRDFs have been measured over a wide range of viewing angles (0-60o incidence; 0-70o reflectance; 0/45/90/135 and 180o azimuth) and have been compared to Diviners broadband solar visible (300nm-3m) off-nadir data, for various targets such as Aristarchus, Kepler Ejecta, the Dufay Anomaly and equatorial and high-latitude Highlands and Mare regions [7]. Furthermore, by fitting Diviners visible off-nadir data to the Hapke model, estimates for various Hapke parameters can be deduced, as in [8]; thus shedding light on the physical properties of the lunar regolith in these regions. Finally, this dataset can be used to set more accurate visible scattering functions within the O3DTM, than by using Lambertian functions [2]. This presentation will detail the laboratory BRDF study; and it will show the latest results from off-nadir remote sensing and thermal modelling studies which utilise this new BRDF dataset.

J., Sheridan, S., Wright, I. P., Morse, A. D.|Planetary and Space Science|205||105287|In situ resource utilisation (ISRU) refers to the extraction and use of local materials, and numerous ISRU techniques have been proposed for use on the Moon. Hydrogen reduction of iron oxide-bearing minerals in the lunar regolith, such as ilmenite, has long been suggested as a potential method for producing water on the Moon to support exploration. Generally, reduction of lunar regolith has been proposed and tested in gas-flowing systems which utilise pumps to re-circulate gases (herein described as dynamic systems), and have been trialled in terrestrial laboratory and simulated environments. However, such technologies have yet to be validated on the lunar surface. An alternative to the dynamic reactor is a static system which utilises a cold finger to condense water from the vapour phase, negating the need for a more complex system where gases are continuously pumped away. The PROSPECT Sample Processing and Analysis (ProSPA) instrument is one such static system that is to be used to measure volatiles in the lunar regolith as a payload onboard the Luna-27 lander. Previous work using a breadboard model of ProSPA led to the development and optimisation of a procedure for extracting water from ilmenite. The present work describes the application of these procedures to the reduction of a lunar simulant (NU-LHT-2M), a lunar meteorite (NWA 12592), and two Apollo soils (10084 and 60500). Three 45 mg samples of each material type were reacted in a furnace at 1000 °C for 4 h in the presence of approximately 420 mbar of hydrogen. All samples reduced to some extent, with the Apollo mare soil (10084) producing the highest average yield of 0.94 wt % O<SUB>2</SUB>; this compares favourably to the yields of ~3-4 wt % O<SUB>2</SUB> by other more optimised demonstrations of O<SUB>2</SUB> extraction from Apollo soils. Samples with higher ilmenite content produced higher yields, however, pyroxene and olivine within the samples also showed some minor reduction. The results demonstrate that a static system such as ProSPA is capable of reducing lunar regolith of various compositions and producing measurable yields of water. The technique is therefore appropriate for performing in situ resource utilisation experiments at the lunar surface. The simple and small scale technique is also appropriate for use in evaluating the grade of potential feedstock for the production of water by hydrogen reduction on the lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2021.105287

O., Friday, J. M., Grimes, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||P059-12|We have characterized the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectro-photometric response of lunar mare regolith simulant JSC-1A and report significant differences from Apollo soil 10084 (Raut et al., 2018). Hapke analyses of the JSC-1A phase curves reveal a ~ 3-4 fold increase in single scattering albedo and a forward scattering behavior compared to 10084. While JSC-1A was designed to simulate the compositional and geotechnical properties of low-Ti mare soil, it lacks so-called "space weathering" attributes such as the nanophase iron in the weathered rims of Apollo grains and glassy agglutinates. Our preliminary analyses suggest space weathering components likely contribute to the FUV darkening of the Apollo soil relative to JSC-1A and changes in scattering properties (backward vs. forward); however, differences in composition, especially the Ti content but also other metal oxides including Na<SUB>2</SUB>O, MgO, K<SUB>2</SUB>O (Taylor and Liu, 2010) and iron oxidation states (Ray et al., 2010) cannot be ruled out presently. Additionally, JSC-1A spectra present a blue slope in the FUV, ~ 10 times larger than those reported for the 10084 soil. Previous studies have attributed UV bluing to space weathering (Hendrix and Vilas, 2006), though light scattering models (e.g. Penttilä et al., 2020) do not corroborate this correlation. Further work with an extended set of Apollo soils and lunar simulants is warranted to deconvolute the relative contributions of weathering versus composition to the FUV spectro-photometric behavior of these materials. We also note that within experimental uncertainties, the single scattering albedo and scattering properties do not show a strong grain size dependence based on our studies with sieved JSC-1A fractions. Future simulant development efforts may consider the inclusion of space weathering components in high fidelity "spectral" analogs of lunar material, in line with ISRU mineral beneficiation using magnetic processes.|

Desorption at the grain/vacuum interface and desorption/transport of water though the porous medium with readsorption were found to reproduce the experimental TPD signal. Signal from the grain/vacuum interface yielded desorption activation energies and site probability distributions. Highland sample 14163 exhibited a broad distribution of binding site energies peaking at 60 kJ mol<SUP>-1</SUP>, while mare sample 10084 exhibited a narrower distribution of binding site energies peaking at 65 kJ mol<SUP>-1</SUP>. The highland sample adsorbed approximately 30% more water than the more space weathered and mature mare sample, suggesting maturity may not be a good predictor of the degree of molecular water uptake on lunar regolith. Water desorption from the lunar surface over a typical lunar day was simulated with the measured coverage-dependent activation energies of the mare and highland samples. The resulting desorption profile of water through a lunar temperature cycle is in general agreement with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lyman-α Mapping Project (LAMP) spacecraft-based observations of trends for both highland and mare assuming ~1% submonolayer coverage and that photon stimulated desorption is neglected.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006147

We used our solar spectrum averaged albedos in a thermal model and compared our model-calculated normal bolometric infrared emission curves with those measured by the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment. We found excellent agreement at the Apollo 11 site, but at the Apollo 16 site, we found that the albedos we measured in the laboratory were 33% brighter than those required to fit the Diviner infrared data. We attribute this difference at Apollo 16 to increased compaction and decreased maturity of the laboratory sample relative to the natural lunar surface, and to local variability in surface albedos at the Apollo 16 field area that are below the spatial resolution of Diviner.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113456

M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||P31C-3466|Understanding solar wind attributed sources of water and how water interacts with the lunar regolith requires knowledge of first order binding and second order desorption energies. These quantities will depend on the regolith composition (chemical and mineralogical) in addition to particle size and space weathering history. First order (chemisorbed water) desorption activation energies of chemisorbed water on Apollo lunar samples 14163 and 10084 were determined by temperature program desorption (TPD) experiments conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Results from these experiments showed that highland sample 14163 exhibited a rather broad distribution of binding site energies peaking at 0.6 eV extending up to 1.8 eV at zero coverage limit while mare sample 10084 displayed a tighter distribution of binding site energies peaking at 0.65 eV ranging only to 1.4 eV at the zero coverage limit. In addition, second order (water formation) recombinative desorption activation energies of mare sample 10084 were measured as well. Water production via recombinative desorption begins around 350 K, corresponding to an activation energy of 0.8 eV assuming a hydroxyl (-OH) saturated surface. Utilizing the above measured experimental temperature driven water formation and desorption data from a lunar mare regolith Apollo sample (10084), the development and progression of the 2.8 μm optical signal on the Moon was simulated. Specifically, this infrared absorption band results from the balance of solar wind production and the subsequent thermal conversion of surficial hydroxyls to water. Overall, the model is consistent with latitude trends in the observed 2.8 μm feature on the Moon.|

Y.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P51D-2916|The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has found evidence of water frost inside permanently shaded regions (PSR's) of craters on the Moon. These results have increased the scientific community's interest in developing technology to harness water ice on the Moon as a resource. Understanding how lunar simulants adsorb water ice will be crucial to the development of this new technology, especially when medium to large sample sizes are required. While JSC-1A is the favored lunar simulant, its lack of np-Fe and differences in grain size distribution could affect the surface area/activation sites available for water frost adsorption on the grains. Far-UV reflectance spectra of the JSC-1A will be taken in the Southwest Ultraviolet Reflectance Chamber (SwURC). After the dry far-UV reflectance spectra are taken, soil samples will be coated with a thin layer of ice, using a micro-capillary doser. The final reflectance spectra will be calculated using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). We investigate the dry reflected far-UV spectra of the JSC-1A and compare to the reflectance spectra of the Apollo lunar soils 10084 and 15041. In addition, preliminary results for the far-UV reflectance spectra of ice coated lunar simulant will also be discussed. Both the dry and ice coated spectra of the JSC-1A simulant will serve as resource to help scientists better understand the differences between the ice coated JSC-1A lunar simulant and the icy lunar soils that will be encountered by future crewed missions to the Moon.|

This soil preferentially backscatters FUV photons as indicated by the angular distribution of the bidirectional reflectance. The phase curves are fitted with a simplified Hapke photometric model to derive the average volume single scattering albedo and scattering phase function of the mare lunar grains.

The angular distribution of the BRDF at Ly-α and 160 nm shows that this mature mare soil, containing nanophase Fe and enriched in Ti, anisotropically scatters light in the forward direction. The phase angle dependence of the BRDF is fitted with Hapke's photometric model with an additional diffuse-directional term. Future plans include measurements of mare and highland soils of differing maturity index (Is/FeO), water ice frost and lunar soil-ice aggregates.

A.|Icarus|255||51|Low energy secondary ions ejected by the solar wind are an important component of tenuous exospheres surrounding airless bodies, since these ions carry information on the planetary surface composition. In this work we examine the dependence of secondary-ion abundance, as a function of energy and mass, on surface composition. The surface compositions of two Apollo soils (10084 and 62231) and a synthetic Corning glass lunar simulant were measured with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and correlated with the spectra of secondary-ions ejected from the same soils by 4 keV He ions. XPS spectra for lunar soils show that the surface compositions are similar to the bulk, but enriched in Fe and O, while depleted in Mg and Ca. 4 keV He irradiation on the lunar soils and a glass simulant preferentially removes O and Si, enriching the surface in Al, Ti, Mg, and Ca. Secondary-ion species ejected from the Apollo soils by 4 keV He include: Na<SUP>+</SUP>, Mg<SUP>+</SUP>, Al<SUP>+</SUP>, Si<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>++</SUP>, Ti<SUP>+</SUP>, Fe<SUP>+</SUP>, and molecular species: NaO<SUP>+</SUP>, MgO<SUP>+</SUP> and SiO<SUP>+</SUP>.

A.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2014||P13D-3841|The Diviner Lunar Radiometer, onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, has produced the first global, high resolution, thermal infrared observations of an airless body. The Moon, which is the most accessible member of this most abundant class of solar system objects, is also the only body for which we have extraterrestrial samples with known spatial context. Here we present the results of a comprehensive study to reproduce an accurate simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with Diviner observations of the lunar surface. It has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions. The data presented here were collected at the University of Oxford Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC). In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (&lt;10-4 mbar) sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber with liquid nitrogen to simulate radiation to the cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples with heaters and lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. A comprehensive suite of experiments were conducted using different sample preparation and heating conditions on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) and compared the results to Diviner noontime data to select the optimal experimental conditions. Additional thermal infrared measurements in optimized SLE were made of 10084 (A11 - LM), 12001 (A12 - LM), 14259 (A14 - LM), 15071 (A15 - S1), 15601 (A15 - S9a), 61141 (A16 - S1), 66031 (A16 - S6), 67701 (A16 - S11), and 70181 (A17 - LM).The Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. We find that analyses of Diviner observations of individual sampling stations and SLE measurements of returned Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal infrared reflectance under terrestrial conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates the Diviner compositional dataset.|

We collected two different types of BUG datasets: a standard set of BRDF measurements at incidence angles of 0-60°, emission angles of 0-80°, and phase angles of 3-140°, and a high-incidence angle set of measurements along and perpendicular to the principal plane at incidence angles of 0-75° and phase angles of 3-155°. The BUG measurements generated a total of 765 data points in four different filters 450, 550, 750 and 950 nm. The Blacklab measurements were acquired at incidence angles of 60-88°, emission angles 60-82°, and phase angles of 17-93° at wavelengths of 455, 554, 699, 949nm. The BUG data were fit to two BRDF models: Hapke’s model [3] as described by Johnson et al, 2010 [4], and a simplified empirical function. The fact that both approaches can satisfactorily fit the BUG data is not unexpected, given the similarities between the functions and their input parameters, and the fact that the BRDF for dark lunar soil is dominated by the single scattering phase functions of the individual soil particles. To compare our lunar sample measurements with LRO Diviner data [5], we selected all daytime observations acquired during the first year of operation within 3 km square boxes centered at the landing sites. We compared Diviner Channel 1 (0.3 - 3 µm) Lambert albedos with model calculated Lambert albedos of the lunar samples at the same photometric angles. In general, we found good agreement between the laboratory and Diviner measurements, particularly at intermediate incidence angles. We are currently reconciling any differences observed between our two datasets to provide mutual validation, and to better understand the Diviner solar reflectance measurements in terms of lunar regolith properties.

M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||P53A-1498|Laboratory visible/near-infrared multispectral goniometer observations of Apollo 16 mature highland soil 68810,2 were acquired using the Bloomsburg University Goniometer (BUG) [1]. These data provided constraints on Hapke radiative transfer models for comparison to model results from similar BUG data acquired of Apollo 11 soil 10084 [2]. Such data are relevant to analyses of lunar surface observations acquired by orbital cameras and spectrometers flown on past and present lunar missions. Standard BUG measurements were acquired (incidence 0-60°, emission 0-80°, and phase 3-140°) comprising 680 measurements per wavelength. We acquired multispectral measurements of the 68810 sample at 450, 550 ,700, 750, 850, and 950 nm. We also supplemented this geometric coverage by constructing an elongated sample holder for measurements in and perpendicular to the principal plane. These measurements were acquired at 450, 550, 750, and 950 nm, and allowed expanded geometric coverage to incidence angles of 0-75° and phase angles of 3-155°, comprising 765 measurements per wavelength. Hapke radiative transfer models were run using 1-term and 2-term Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase functions to determine photometric properties such as single scattering albedo and backscattering behavior. The results show little difference in the photometric parameters between model runs using the standard and expanded data sets. Models of the 68810 highland sample exhibit higher single scattering albedo (by ~66%) than the 10084 mare sample models, consistent with modeling of Clementine and other remote sensing observations [e.g., 3]. The 68810 soil is also slightly more broadly backscattering (in both 1-term and 2-term HG models), with properties similar to results from laboratory analyses of agglutinates and rough, clear spheres. Both Apollo soils are more backscattering than any lunar analog soil yet measured [2]. The opposition effect width h (compaction parameter) is slightly smaller for the 68810 highland soil (h=0.031), suggesting a less uniform average grain size and/or more porous soil than the 10084 mare soil (h=0.040). This is consistent with the comparison of highland and mare regions from [4].

2009AGUSM.V74B..04N|2009|Lunar Magmatic Volatiles|Nekvasil, H., McCubbin, F. M., Lindsley, D. H.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2009||V74B-04|Samples returned from the Apollo Missions prompted a variety of experimental investigations (e.g., [1-4]) which form the basis of our current understanding of lunar compositional evolution. The observed low abundances of solidus temperature-suppressing volatiles justified volatile-free experiments. However, the low-pressure nature of the samples makes it unlikely that volatiles were retained during magma ascent and eruption. In an effort to re-assess the lunar mantle volatile budget, we are focusing on the mineral apatite because of its incorporation of F, Cl, and OH as essential structural constituents and its greater ability to retain such volatiles relative to melt. Apatite grains analyzed from magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks (14161,7111, 14161,7269 and 14161,7264), KREEPy impact melt rocks associated with magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks (14161,7233; 14161,7110; 14161,7062; 12033,634-25; SaU 169-4), and mare basalts (79195; 12037,224; 74246; 12023,147,1; 10084; LAP 02205; LAP 03632; NWA 2977) by electron microprobe using the technique of [5,6] show two distinct compositional groups. Apatite from the mare basalts analyzed are primarily mixtures of fluor- "missing component" (OH?) apatite with low Cl abundance, while that from the magnesian- and alkali-suite rocks are fluor-chlor mixtures. Apatite/basaltic melt partition coefficients for F, Cl, and H2O from the data of [7] provide first estimates of magmatic volatile abundances in lunar magmas. They suggest that magmatic water may have been more abundant than F and Cl at the stage of apatite crystallization in mare basalts. In contrast, at this stage, the magmas that produced the Mg-and alkali suite minerals were F- and Cl-dominated. These results have wide-reaching implications regarding the chemical and physical evolution of the Moon and therefore, the next generation of experimental investigations.

R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2009||P31E-08|The Moon has a complex three-dimensional shape with significant large-scale and small-scale topographic relief. The Moon’s topography largely controls the distribution of incident solar radiation, as well as the scattered solar and infrared radiation fields. Topography also affects the Moon’s interaction with the space environment, its magnetic field, and the propagation of seismic waves. As more extensive and detailed lunar datasets become available, there is an increasing need to interpret and compare them with the results of physical models in a fully three-dimensional context. We have developed a three-dimensional framework for lunar modeling we call the Digital Moon. The goal of this work is to enable high fidelity physical modeling and visualization of the Moon in a parallel computing environment. The surface of the Moon is described by a continuous triangular mesh of arbitrary shape and spatial scale. For regions of limited geographic extent, it is convenient to employ meshes on a rectilinear grid. However for global-scale modeling, we employ a continuous geodesic gridding scheme (Teanby, 2008). Each element in the mesh surface is allowed to have a unique set of physical properties. Photon and particle interactions between mesh elements are modeled using efficient ray tracing algorithms. Heat, mass, photon and particle transfer within each mesh element are modeled in one dimension. Each compute node is assigned a portion of the mesh and collective interactions between elements are handled through network interfaces. We have used the model to calculate lunar surface and subsurface temperatures that can be compared directly with radiometric temperatures measured by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The model includes realistic surface photometric functions based on goniometric measurements of lunar soil samples (Foote and Paige, 2009), and one-dimensional thermal models based on lunar remote sensing and Apollo heat flow measurements (Vasavada et al., 1999; Siegler et al., this meeting). Using the latest available topographic data, the results of the model are in excellent qualitative agreement with the Diviner measurements and we are in the process of refining input parameters to obtain better quantitative agreements. Other near-term applications for the model include visualizing the LCROSS impact event for Earth-based observers, modeling the fluxes of thermal and epithermal neutrons observed by Lunar Prospector, and adapting the model to other airless bodies.

B.|Journal of Geophysical Research (Planets)|113|E2|E02003|We examine the ability of a radiative transfer model based on the theory of Hapke (1981, 1993, 2001) to reproduce reflectance spectra of known composition, as well as extract compositional information from reflectance spectra. We test this model using spectra of two-component mineral mixtures, spectra of lunar mare soils studied by the Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium (LSCC), and a telescopic spectrum of the Apollo 11 landing site. The model is able to accurately reproduce spectra of two-component mineral mixtures and can be used to accurately predict mineral abundances, mineral chemistry, and particle size. Reflectance spectra of the lunar mare soils are modeled using the mineral abundances and chemistries reported for each soil. We collect our own mineral and chemical information for one of these samples, 12001, in order to examine the effects of several simplifying assumptions employed by the LSCC and conclude that the classification of glass (volcanic/impact versus agglutinitic) can have large consequences on the predicted spectra. Model spectra can generally mimic the lunar mare sample spectra, though with consistent errors in contrast and continuum slope, and absorption bands offset to shorter wavelengths. The Apollo 11 telescopic spectrum is successfully modeled with mineralogy and chemistry from sample 10084, though the fit is improved with slight variations in mineralogy or mineral chemistry. We find that varying pyroxene chemistry can have as large an effect on spectral shape as varying mineral abundance.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JE002929

S.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|1|177|Soil 10084 is the only representative soil sample from Apollo 11 and arguably one of the purest mare soils in the Apollo collection. It was wet sieved in 1970 and dry sieved in 1971 with different results. Therefore, some doubt about its grain size distribution persists. We consider allocation inhomogeneity, if any, to be a minor cause for the discrepancy. Rather, the difference in methodology is likely to be the major cause for different results. We report the results of a new analysis of an allocation of 0.99 g using the contemporary method of wet sieving at JSC; this method uses water instead of freon. Our results show that the mean grain size and sorting of the submillimeter fraction of soil 10084 are 4.28 theta (= 51 μm) and 2.23 theta (= 213 μm), respectively. A significant proportion (14.2%) of the soil is in the &lt;10 μm size range, which contrasts to previous determinations of 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively. The newly determined grain size distribution is skewed towards the finest grain sizes. This result is more compatible with the high maturity of this soil than the results of previous determinations.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2001.tb01818.x

J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2

The rims have a thin outer sublayer 10-50 nm thick that contains the ilmenite-incompatible elements Si, Al, Ca and S. This overlies a relatively thicker (50-250 nm) inner sublayer of nanocrystalline Ti-oxide precipitates in a matrix of single-crystal ilmenite that is structurally continuous with the underlying host grain. Microstructural information, as well as data from x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) analysis of the inner sublayer, suggest that both the inner and outer sublayer assemblages are reduced and that the inner layer is depleted in Fe relative to the underlying ilmenite. The chemistry of the outer sublayer suggests that it is a surface deposit of sputtered or impact-vaporized components from the bulk lunar soil. The inner sublayer is part of the original host grain that has been physically and chemically processed, but not amorphized, by solar ion irradiation and possibly some subsolidus heating. The fact that the deposited outer sublayer is consistently much thinner than the radiation-altered inner sublayer indicates that only a minor fraction of the total rim volume is a product of vapor or sputter deposition. This finding is in contrast to recent descriptions of thick deposited layers on one-third of regolith silicate grains and indicates that ilmenite and silicate rims as a group are different in the fraction of deposited material that they contain.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1996.tb02117.x

Similar spectra were acquired for size separates for Apollo 11 soil 10084. The finest fraction dominates both the visible and the midIR. Apollo 16 soils exhibit the shortest Christiansen Frequency (CF), a trend consistent with their feldspathic character. Finer soil size fractions, however, are observed to have longer CF, perhaps due to the effective strength of the Reststrahlen bands (RB). Altogether, features in the near-infrared are currently the most readily interpreted in terms of mineral composition and space weathering effects.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|87||260|It has been known for some time that the part of the lunar regolith smaller than 10 micrometers (&lt;10 μm) is chemically distinct from the bulk soil. Specifically, it is enriched in Al, Ca, Na, K, light rare earth elements, and Th, and depleted in Mg, Fe, Mn, and Sc. Three models have been proposed to explain those systematics. The Exotic Component model holds that a fine-grained, KREEPy exotic component was distributed on a global scale, perhaps by the Imbrian impact. In the Simple Comminution model, the &lt;10 μm chemical systematics are due to differential comminution processes with fine-grained melt-rock mesostasis and feldspar concentrating in this fraction. The Soil Mixing model states that the chemical systematics are due to mixing of compositionally distinct soils that have different grain-size distributions. To determine which model is correct, modal petrographic data were obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X ray analysis for the &lt;10 μm fractions of four Apollo soils: 10084, 14163, 15271, and 64501. Modal results are consistent with chemical data regarding feldspathic and KREEP enrichments in the finest fraction. Soil glass contents, crystalline silica, and plagioclase/mafic mineral ratios are greater in the &lt;10 μm fraction than in the coarser fractions for all soils. Grain-size distributions are inconsistent with a fine-grained exotic component derived from distant sources. Comminution of local lithologies, vertical mixing, and local lateral transport control the &lt;10 μm soil composition.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB087iS01p0A260

A tendency found for the Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios in the etched ilmenite to reflect the solar-wind ratio measured in the solar-wind composition experiment foils may represent a cancellation of mass-fractionation effects. The Ne-20/Ne-22 ratio in the saturated layer is lowered with respect to the solar wind by preferential diffusive loss, but is raised again in the gas diffusing inward by the same preferential mobilization of Ne-20 relative to Ne-22. Attention is also given to the significance of the findings in the case of argon, krypton, and xenon.|

Grain size-ordinate intercept analysis is applied to bulk soil, ilmenite, and plagioclase separates obtained from 1 mm or smaller fines sample 10084,48. K-Ar ages for ilmenite, plagioclase, and total soil separates are determined to be 2.80, 3.38 and 4.00 AE, respectively. It appears that 10084,48 may consist primarily of two components. In this view, the first is locally derived, forms 65-75% of the present day regolith and may show that a local degassing event(s) occurred between 2.8 and 3.5 AE ago. The second component is similar to material from the lunar highlands. It may be local or foreign in origin and contributes the remaining 25-35% of the soil. This component exhibits an age of 4.00 AE and is either slightly older than, or contemporaneous with, the oldest of the returned Apollo 11 basalts. Within the limits of experimental error, the trapped Ar-38/Ar-36 ratio is constant at 0.1890 for all the soil components examined.|
1974E&PSL..23..206L|1974|Chemical composition of boulder-2 rocks and soils, Apollo 17, station 2|Laul, J. C., Schmitt, R. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|2|206|Forty-two elements have been measured via INAA and RNAA in six samples of five rocks from a 2-m tan-gray boulder-2 breccia (South Massif), in four soils from the South Massif and a valley soil. The chemical composition of the four metaclastic rocks corresponds to "high alumina" (52% Pl) and medium-K KREEP-type rocks. Rock 72335,2 is a medium K anorthositic gabbro (74% Pl). Both the North and South Massifs appear to be medium-K KREEP in composition and thus may represent a single stratigraphic unit of the Serenitatis basin event. Four soils of the South Massif are identical in composition to medium-K KREEP; they are more feldspathic and lower in LIL trace elements relative to the boulder-2 rocks. The valley soil 75081 is like the 10084 soil; both soils are high in TiO <SUB>2</SUB> and both are deficient in KREEP. Th and U give a sharp distinction between the valley and highland soils. The South Massif rocks and soils contain siderophiles at the 2-4% Cl level and show an ancient meteoritic pattern. Five samples of the four rocks have Ir/Au ratios of ± 0.02 which we assign to the Serenitatis basis planetesimal. The valley soil at Camelot Crater has low siderophiles (1% Cl). Our systematic study of four shadowed and exposed soils does not support the labile hypothesis for Cd, In, Tl and Zn. We observe no volatile (atmophile) movement from the South Massif highland soils to the valley soil 75081. The volatiles Cs and Tl appear to have been fractionated in the boulder-2 rocks during cratering, brecciation and metamorphic processes. The uniform ratio of FeO/MnO = 80-85, observed for all previous mare and highland sites, also holds for the Taurus-Littrow site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90195-2

R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|37|4|875|The inert gases have been measured in six size fractions covering the range below 500 μm, in a single feldspathic fragment weighing 523 μg, and in an agglutinate particle weighing 465 μg. The two size fractions between 125 and 250 μm as well as 250 and 500 μm were separated into magnetic and non-magnetic portions, which were measured separately. Like the Apollo and Luna 16 fines, the terra fines represented by Luna 20 are very rich in trapped solar-wind gases, but they contain relatively less He <SUP>4</SUP> and Ne <SUP>20</SUP>, which is revealed by their average He <SUP>4</SUP>/Ne <SUP>20</SUP> ratio of 35 and Ne <SUP>20</SUP>/Ar <SUP>36</SUP> ratio of 2.9. Obviously the terra materials are less retentive for solar-wind He and Ne than typical mare fines such as 10084. Whether this is due to the relatively small TiO <SUB>2</SUB> or the relatively large plagioclase content of the former is not resolved. ( Ar <SUP>36</SUP>/Kr <SUP>84</SUP>) <SUB>trapped</SUB> and ( Ar <SUP>36</SUP>/Xe <SUP>132</SUP>) <SUB>trapped</SUB> ratios are relatively large; the average values are 2800 and 14400, respectively. The apparent Ne <SUP>21</SUP> radiation ages of all the size fractions are in the range 209-286 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr; the average is 260 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr. This is in the range of values known for the Apollo and Luna 16 fines. The feldspathic fragment has a much greater apparent Ne <SUB>c</SUB><SUP>21</SUP> age of 780 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr. The Ar <SUP>40</SUP>-Ar <SUP>36</SUP> systematic reveals the presence of two Ar <SUP>40</SUP> components, because Ar<SUP>40</SUP> = (1.41 ± 0.076) Ar<SUP>36</SUP> + (0.490 ± 0.130) × 10 <SUP>-4</SUP> (cm <SUP>3</SUP> STP/g). The Ar <SUP>40</SUP>/Ar <SUP>36</SUP> slope of 1.41 is not inconsistent with an origin of the sample from a relatively old terra region.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(73)90185-3

The value for Apollo 12 fines 12007 is &lt; 0.73% or &lt; 0.57%, depending on the adopted U content. For the combined Apollo 14 fines 14003 + 14259 we find a minimum value of 0.23%, and a maximum value of 0.55%. Emanation of <SUP>220</SUP>Rn has been observed in the case of the Apollo 14 fines. The relatively small emanation rates could be due to the absence of interstitial air and water on the lunar surface as has been suggested by Lindstrom et al. [5]. However, it seems also possible that U and Th are principally contained in the lunar fines within minerals which are intrinsically poor radon emanators, such as zircons. The small emanation rates require 100% <SUP>222</SUP>Rn escape from a regolith thickness of about 10 m (U ∼ 4 ppm) to explain the observed <SUP>210</SUP>Po activity in Mare Tranquillitatis by Turkevich et al. [3]. However, this problem cannot be settled satisfactorily until emanation measurements have been made at temperatures of about 120°C.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(72)90047-7
1972E&PSL..14....7K|1972|Effects of vaporization and condensation on Apollo 11 glass spherules: Implications for cooling rates|Kurat, Gero, Keil, Klaus|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|14|1|7|Fourteen of 40 glass spherules present in a section of the Apollo 11 microbreccia 10019,22 were found to exhibit steep concentration gradients at their rims: the oxides of the relatively volatile elements Na, K, and P increase by, respectively, factors of up to 67, 16, and &gt; 54, at the spherule rims in comparison to the homogeneous centers. These gradients usually extend over 25-30 μ. Furthermore, the natural surfaces of 11 unpolished glass spherules separated from the fines 10084,97, in 60-80% of all cases, show higher concentrations in Na <SUB>2</SUB>O, K <SUB>2</SUB>O, and P <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>5</SUB> than the averages for the central portions of 45 independently analyzed glass spherules. It is suggested that the concentration gradients observed are diffusion gradients and are the result of the impact event which produced the glasses: in the impact melting process, splash drops of melt formed that lost volatiles by vaporization. If the impact-produced vapor cloud surrounding the freely-floating spherules was large enough, then partial condensation of the volatile elements in the vapor cloud should take place upon cooling. These volatile elements condensed on the relatively hot spherules, and thermal diffusion of Na, K and P from the spherule surfaces towards their interiors occurred. Depending upon the temperature, cooling rate, and diffusion coefficient for the particular spherule composition, concentration gradients of different steepness and width should originate. A procedure is described to determine the cooling rate of a spherule from measured concentration gradients, provided the diffusion coefficients are known for the particular glass compositions in question.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(72)90071-4

S., Wilkening, L.|Nature Physical Science|233|41|114|LOW energy solar flare protons induce nuclear reactions in barium isotopes in lunar materials and meteorites with the emission of a few nucleons. Such interactions give rise to the possibility that a compositionally distinct component exists in lunar (also in meteorites) xenon. This component is different from the galactic cosmic ray induced component which in general is produced by the emission of several nucleons. In case of radioactive and stable nuclides, it was shown<SUP>1-3</SUP> that the isotope production by solar cosmic rays in the near surface regions of lunar rocks is limited to the top few millimetres while at greater depths the galactic cosmic rays play the major role. The lunar fines, on the other hand, represent an average of both the galactic and solar cosmic ray effects. Indications of solar flare produced isotopic effects in the light rare gases from Apollo 11, 12 fines have been reported by Yaniv et al. in the Apollo 12 Conference at Houston, 1971, and in case of krypton in Apollo 11 fines by Podosek et al.<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we have analysed in detail the Xe data<SUP>5,6</SUP> obtained in the stepwise heating experiments on soil 10,084 and rocks 10,044 and 10,057 from Apollo 11 with a specific aim of understanding the effects of galactic and solar cosmic rays on lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/physci233114a0

The abundance patterns of Li, Be and B in the different soil samples are remarkably similar although the concentrations vary by a factor of four to eight being lowest in the Luna 16 sample and highest in the fines from Apollo 14. A strong correlation of Li, B and K was found for the soil samples collected at the four sites. Within larger experimental errors Be is also correlated with these elements. Lunar abundances of Li, Be and B are in good agreement with those in the terrestrial standard basalt BCR-1. Relative to basaltic achondrites and, in particular, relative to chondrites, lunar Li, Be and B are enriched by a factor of up to 100. The Li, Be and B concentrations in the Apollo 12 fines are enriched by factors of three to five relative to the average concentrations reported for the Apollo 12 basalts. This enrichment most probably is caused by the same additional component in the fines which is responsible for the three to four-fold excess of K, rare earth elements and P (KREEP) relative to the basalts returned from the Ocean of Storms. It is shown that the fines from Apollo 12 and 14 can be related to each other by a two-component mixing model, one end member being the Apollo 12 basalts, the other one the fine sample 14141 whose chemical composition seems to very similar to that of the KREEP component.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90211-1

This is not the case; the <SUP>84</SUP>Kr/ <SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratios from sample 12070 are substantially greater than those from the feldspathic and basaltic fragments in 10084. The trend-reversal in the feldspathic particles could be due to the trapping of genuine primordial lunar Kr and Xe. The reversal in the Apollo 11 basaltic fragments might be due to periodic near-quantitative loss of the lighter gases by impact heating, with the Apollo 11 fines containing a relatively large proportion of strongly heated fragments.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90085-9

These features were then compared with those observed in broken fragments extracted either from lunar rocks 10047 and 12063 or from different types of meteorites (Orgueil; Pesyanoe, Shergotty). The finest fraction of the Apollo 11 lunar soil samples is constituted of about 80% of well ordered but rounded crystals which are frequently overlaid by a thin skin of amorphous material. In the Apollo 12 soil the grains are coarser, the fraction of crystalline material is higher (∼90%) and the proportion of crystals showing an amorphous skin is smaller, but both lunar soil samples are very different from meteoritic or lunar rock matter. Some implications of the present results concerning the fabric of the finest fraction of the lunar regolith, the ancient solar wind and meteoritic research are briefly outlined.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90003-8
