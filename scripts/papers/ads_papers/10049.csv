2013AGUSMGP24A..05F|2013|Lunar Paleomagnetism|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2013||GP24A-05|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.|

D.|European Planetary Science Congress 2012|||EPSC2012-778|By the end of the Apollo era, paleomagnetic studies had established that lunar rocks carry a remanent magnetization that was acquired on the Moon. However, it was unclear whether this magnetization was produced by a core dynamo field or by plasmas generated by meteoroid impacts. We have been reexamining the paleomagnetism of lunar rocks with the goal of establishing the origin of the magnetizing field and its temporal history. Our recent analyses of troctolite 76535 and mare basalts 10020, 10017, and 10049 have now confirmed that a lunar core dynamo existed with a surface intensity of ~60-70 μT from at least 4.2 to 3.6 billion years (Ga) ago. Furthermore, our analyses of mare basalts 12022 and 15597 have identified no stable magnetization, indicating that the dynamo field had declined to weak (&lt;7 μT) or null intensities by 3.3 Ga. The protracted lifetime of the lunar dynamo may require an unusual power source like mechanical stirring. Furthermore, the strong inferred intensities present a challenge to current dynamo theory.|

P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||P13D-1696|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498.

1973E&PSL..18...65F|1973|Thermal diffusivity of lunar rocks under atmospheric and vacuum conditions|Fujii, Naoyuki, Osako, Masahiro|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|18|1|65|Thermal diffusivity, k, of three lunar rocks (10049 and 10069; Type A, Apollo 11 and 14311; Apollo 14) and a terrestrial basalt (alkaline olivine basalt, Oki-doˆgo, Japan) was measured under one atmosphere and in vacuum conditions (10 <SUP>-3</SUP> ̃ 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> mmHg) in the temperature range from 85 to 850°K. The semi-empirical curve of k =A + B/T +CT <SUP>3</SUP> is fitted to the data in each condition. The porosity of rocks strongly affects the thermal diffusivity at low temperature ( T ≲ 500°K) in vacuum condition. At 150°K, thermal diffusivity of lunar rocks with porosity of 5.5% (10049) and 11% (10069) at one atmosphere is about 1.7 and 3.2 times of that in vacuum, respectively. The difference between the values at one atmosphere and those in vacuum decreases as the temperature increases. Measurements of k should be made at gas pressures at least lower than 10 <SUP>-3</SUP> mmHg to estimate the value under lunar surface conditions.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90035-6
