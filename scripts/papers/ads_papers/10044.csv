M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||V51A-01|Lunar apatites and melt inclusions contain appreciable concentrations of H, C, S, and Cl, suggesting that at least some portions of the Moon have higher concentrations of these volatile elements than previously thought, perhaps in concentrations similar to Earth. This has led to a renewed interest in lunar volatiles and to efforts to explain these results in the context of models for Moon formation. The presence of S in lunar apatites is puzzling because lunar basalts are thought to form in low oxygen fugacity (fO<SUB>2</SUB>) conditions where sulfur can only exist in its reduced form (S<SUP>2-</SUP>), a substitution not previously observed in natural terrestrial apatite. We present measurements of the oxidation state of S in lunar and terrestrial apatites in order to test for the possibility that S<SUP>2-</SUP> partitions into apatites equilibrated with silicate magmas under very low fO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions. Measured apatite grains in Apollo basalts 12039 and 10044 have igneous textures, including embayments and displaying resorption textures with mesostasis glass, indicating that the apatite was present in the rock at the time the mesostasis was liquid. The mesostasis also contain Fe-metal and troilite, and sometimes fayalite, Fe-metal, and silica or ulvöspinel, Fe-metal, and ilmenite, indicating that the fO<SUB>2</SUB> of the mesostasis during apatite crystallization was IW or lower. Our new XANES measurements demonstrate that these lunar apatites and mesostasis glass contain dominantly S<SUP>2-</SUP>, consistent with the low-fO<SUB>2</SUB> mineral assemblage of the rocks. We compare this with terrestrial Durango apatite, which our XANES measurements show contains dominantly S<SUP>6+</SUP>, consistent with Durango apatite being equilibrated at fO<SUB>2</SUB>s &gt;IW+6 ( QFM+2). The presence of S<SUP>2-</SUP> -only apatites in lunar lavas and S<SUP>6+</SUP>-only apatites in terrestrial rocks suggest that there probably are natural apatites formed at appropriate fO<SUB>2</SUB>s that contain both S<SUP>6+</SUP> and S<SUP>2-</SUP> species. We suggest that relatively reduced terrestrial or Martian igneous rocks could contain apatites with mixed sulfur speciation. The S<SUP>6+</SUP>/S<SUP>2-</SUP> ratios of apatites from such environments could record potential variations in the fO<SUB>2</SUB> of their host rocks at the time of apatite crystallization. A well-calibrated S-in-apatite oxybarometer based on this phenomenon could thus have wide application.|

Translating measurements of volatile abundances in lunar apatite into the volatile inventory of the silicate melts from which they crystallized, and ultimately of the mantle source regions of lunar magmas, however, has proved more difficult than initially thought. In this contribution, we report a detailed characterization of mesostasis regions in four Apollo mare basalts (10044, 12064, 15058, and 70035) in order to ascertain the compositions of the melts from which apatite crystallized. The texture, modal mineralogy, and reconstructed bulk composition of these mesostasis regions vary greatly within and between samples. There is no clear relationship between bulk-rock basaltic composition and that of bulk-mesostasis regions, indicating that bulk-rock composition may have little influence on mesostasis compositions. The development of individual melt pockets, combined with the occurrence of silicate liquid immiscibility, exerts greater control on the composition and texture of mesostasis regions. In general, the reconstructed late-stage lunar melts have roughly andesitic to dacitic compositions with low alkali contents, displaying much higher SiO<SUB>2</SUB> abundances than the bulk compositions of their host magmatic rocks. Relevant partition coefficients for apatite-melt volatile partitioning under lunar conditions should, therefore, be derived from experiments conducted using intermediate compositions instead of compositions representing mare basalts.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12681

P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|

S., Wilkening, L.|Nature Physical Science|233|41|114|LOW energy solar flare protons induce nuclear reactions in barium isotopes in lunar materials and meteorites with the emission of a few nucleons. Such interactions give rise to the possibility that a compositionally distinct component exists in lunar (also in meteorites) xenon. This component is different from the galactic cosmic ray induced component which in general is produced by the emission of several nucleons. In case of radioactive and stable nuclides, it was shown<SUP>1-3</SUP> that the isotope production by solar cosmic rays in the near surface regions of lunar rocks is limited to the top few millimetres while at greater depths the galactic cosmic rays play the major role. The lunar fines, on the other hand, represent an average of both the galactic and solar cosmic ray effects. Indications of solar flare produced isotopic effects in the light rare gases from Apollo 11, 12 fines have been reported by Yaniv et al. in the Apollo 12 Conference at Houston, 1971, and in case of krypton in Apollo 11 fines by Podosek et al.<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we have analysed in detail the Xe data<SUP>5,6</SUP> obtained in the stepwise heating experiments on soil 10,084 and rocks 10,044 and 10,057 from Apollo 11 with a specific aim of understanding the effects of galactic and solar cosmic rays on lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/physci233114a0

M., Steinborn, T. L.|Science|167|3918|497|Ten Apollo 11 specimens were divided into 24 samples. Sodium contents of 8 diverse specimens cluster tightly about 0.3 percent. Plagioclase separated from sample 10044 contains about 1.09 percent Na; barium is not enriched in the plagioclase separate. Contents of the rare earths are strikingly high, and relative abundances resemble those of calcium-rich achondrites or abyssal basalts but are depleted in Eu by factors of 2 to 3 and in La by about 20 percent. The plagioclase separate is enriched in Eu and pyroxenes and opaque minerals are Eu-depleted. Fine fractions of 10044 are about 20 to 40 percent richer in most rare earths (50 percent for Eu) than coarse fractions, probably because of the presence of small grains in which rare earths are markedly concentrated. "Microgabbro" 10045 is impoverished, relative to the soil, in rare earths and Hf. Ratios by mass of Zr to Hf are comparatively low. Abundances of Mn, Co, Fe, Sc and Cr suggest systematic differences between igneous rocks on one hand and breccias and "soil" on the other. From the Co abundances, no more than about 3 percent of the present "soil" can consist of chondritic meteorite contamination.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.497
