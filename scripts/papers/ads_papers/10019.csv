These gradients usually extend over 25-30 μ. Furthermore, the natural surfaces of 11 unpolished glass spherules separated from the fines 10084,97, in 60-80% of all cases, show higher concentrations in Na <SUB>2</SUB>O, K <SUB>2</SUB>O, and P <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>5</SUB> than the averages for the central portions of 45 independently analyzed glass spherules. It is suggested that the concentration gradients observed are diffusion gradients and are the result of the impact event which produced the glasses: in the impact melting process, splash drops of melt formed that lost volatiles by vaporization. If the impact-produced vapor cloud surrounding the freely-floating spherules was large enough, then partial condensation of the volatile elements in the vapor cloud should take place upon cooling. These volatile elements condensed on the relatively hot spherules, and thermal diffusion of Na, K and P from the spherule surfaces towards their interiors occurred. Depending upon the temperature, cooling rate, and diffusion coefficient for the particular spherule composition, concentration gradients of different steepness and width should originate. A procedure is described to determine the cooling rate of a spherule from measured concentration gradients, provided the diffusion coefficients are known for the particular glass compositions in question.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(72)90071-4

Craters with diameters between 2 microns and 0.8 mm were observed. Approx. 1 crater larger than 0.15 mm in diameter per 1 mm <SUP>2</SUP> and 1 crater larger than 2 μm per 500 μm <SUP>2</SUP> could be found. The time of exposure is calculated from crater number densities and cosmic dust influx values to be 10 000 yr and 100 yr for layers of respectivethicknesses. On lunar glassy spherules impact features were found which yield the same crater number densities. The phenomenology of high velocity impacts was studies by shooting microspheres on targets similar to lunar material using a 2 MV dust accelerator.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90095-6
