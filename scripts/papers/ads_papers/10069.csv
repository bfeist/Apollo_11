The results for the five basalts 10003, 10047, 12004, 12051, and 77135 are consistent with a single-stage exposure. Four basalts, 10057, 10069, 12040, and 12053, experienced a multistage exposure. Using the U-235-Xe-136 dating method, the time of their early exposure to cosmic rays on the lunar surface was dated to have begun three to four aeons ago, immediately after rock formation as defined by their crystallization ages. The durations and shielding depths for the proposed two-stage exposure models of the four basalts were calculated. From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C171
1973E&PSL..18...65F|1973|Thermal diffusivity of lunar rocks under atmospheric and vacuum conditions|Fujii, Naoyuki, Osako, Masahiro|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|18|1|65|Thermal diffusivity, k, of three lunar rocks (10049 and 10069; Type A, Apollo 11 and 14311; Apollo 14) and a terrestrial basalt (alkaline olivine basalt, Oki-doˆgo, Japan) was measured under one atmosphere and in vacuum conditions (10 <SUP>-3</SUP> ∼ 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> mmHg) in the temperature range from 85 to 850°K. The semi-empirical curve of k =A + B/T +CT <SUP>3</SUP> is fitted to the data in each condition. The porosity of rocks strongly affects the thermal diffusivity at low temperature ( T ≲ 500°K) in vacuum condition. At 150°K, thermal diffusivity of lunar rocks with porosity of 5.5% (10049) and 11% (10069) at one atmosphere is about 1.7 and 3.2 times of that in vacuum, respectively. The difference between the values at one atmosphere and those in vacuum decreases as the temperature increases. Measurements of k should be made at gas pressures at least lower than 10 <SUP>-3</SUP> mmHg to estimate the value under lunar surface conditions.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90035-6
