The results for the five basalts 10003, 10047, 12004, 12051, and 77135 are consistent with a single-stage exposure. Four basalts, 10057, 10069, 12040, and 12053, experienced a multistage exposure. Using the U-235-Xe-136 dating method, the time of their early exposure to cosmic rays on the lunar surface was dated to have begun three to four aeons ago, immediately after rock formation as defined by their crystallization ages. The durations and shielding depths for the proposed two-stage exposure models of the four basalts were calculated. From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C171
1971NPhS..233..114R|1971|Solar Flare Effects in Lunar Xenon|Rao, M. N., Gopalan, K., Venkatavaradan, V. S., Wilkening, L.|Nature Physical Science|233|41|114|LOW energy solar flare protons induce nuclear reactions in barium isotopes in lunar materials and meteorites with the emission of a few nucleons. Such interactions give rise to the possibility that a compositionally distinct component exists in lunar (also in meteorites) xenon. This component is different from the galactic cosmic ray induced component which in general is produced by the emission of several nucleons. In case of radioactive and stable nuclides, it was shown<SUP>1-3</SUP> that the isotope production by solar cosmic rays in the near surface regions of lunar rocks is limited to the top few millimetres while at greater depths the galactic cosmic rays play the major role. The lunar fines, on the other hand, represent an average of both the galactic and solar cosmic ray effects. Indications of solar flare produced isotopic effects in the light rare gases from Apollo 11, 12 fines have been reported by Yaniv et al. in the Apollo 12 Conference at Houston, 1971, and in case of krypton in Apollo 11 fines by Podosek et al.<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we have analysed in detail the Xe data<SUP>5,6</SUP> obtained in the stepwise heating experiments on soil 10,084 and rocks 10,044 and 10,057 from Apollo 11 with a specific aim of understanding the effects of galactic and solar cosmic rays on lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/physci233114a0

H.|Science|167|3918|749|The specific heats of lunar samples 10057 and 10084 returned by the Apollo 11 mission have been measured between 90 and 350 degrees Kelvin by use of an adiabatic calorimeter. The samples are representative of type A vesicular basalt-like rocks and of finely divided lunar soil. The specific heat of these materials changes smoothly from about 0.06 calorie per gram per degree at 90 degrees Kelvin to about 0.2 calorie per gram per degree at 350 degrees Kelvin. The thermal parameter γ = (kρ C)<SUP>-1/2</SUP> for the lunar surface will accordingly vary by a factor of about 2 between lunar noon and midnight.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.749

The travel times predicted from the velocity-depth curve of sample 10057 are consistent with the results of the Apollo 12 seismic experiments. At pressures below 200 bars, the samples are highly attenuating; for both P and S waves, the value of Q is about 10.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.726
