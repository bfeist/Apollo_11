Traditional study of these samples has been conducted in two dimensions (2D) via interrogation of thin sections and subsequent in-situ chemical analyses, yet returned samples are three-dimensional (3D) objects and therefore preserve evidence of lunar volcanic processes in 3D. Here, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was used for the first time to evaluate lava emplacement mechanisms on the lunar surface. A total of six samples from the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 missions were studied. From volumetric mineralogies, textures, and petrofabrics, lunar lava cooling histories were inferred. Collectively, these physical characteristics were then correlated with pāhoehoe lava flow lobe stratigraphy. Samples 10057 and 15556 are inferred to have crystallized in the lobe crust of their respective lava flow lobes. Samples 12038, 12043, and 70017 may mark the transition between the vesiculated, fine-grained lobe crust, and the dense, coarse-grained lobe core in their respective flows. Finally, coarse-grained, and non-vesiculated sample 15085 is inferred to have crystallized in a lobe core. No statistically significant petrofabric is preserved in any of the samples, indicating that the basalt samples studied here, and the lava flows they originated from, experienced minimal strain during emplacement and solidification on the lunar surface. This is consistent with the low viscosities attributed to lunar mare lavas. Future in-situ sampling of extraterrestrial basaltic products should focus on detailed documentation of, and collection from, stratigraphically well-characterized lava flows to further evaluate the interpretations presented here.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115216
2021AGUFM.P55E1981G|2021|New insights into lunar magmatism: Investigating open system processes in basaltic magma reservoirs on the Moon.|Gawronska, Aleksandra, McLeod, Claire|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2021||P55E-1981|Extensive research on Earth throughout the past several decades has demonstrated the dynamic nature of magmatic storage regions within the crust. Molten material at depth likely exists in the form of crystal mushes, where crystals and liquid coexist (and interact to varying degrees) prior to transport and emplacement. Within this dynamic framework, magmas within a storage reservoir may exist separately from each other and evolve to have distinct compositions through both closed and open system processes. In addition, during recharge, remobilization, and ascent, distinct magma batches may mix and mingle leading to the preservation of phenocrystic, antecrystic, and xenocrystic crystal populations in the magmatic rock record. At present, the occurrence of such processes in magmatic systems on other bodies in our Solar System remains largely unexplored. The research presented here aims to investigate the petrogenetic history of crystal cargoes within Apollo lunar basalts in order to evaluate whether magmatic processes on the Moon operated in open and/or closed systems. Specifically, six Apollo basalts (10057, 12038, 12043, 15085, 15556, 70017) are being investigated using in-situ analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Initial mapping of major elements via SEM energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) has revealed that pyroxenes in all samples are zoned in Mg, Fe, and Ca. The zoning in finer-grained samples (e.g., sample 10057 from Apollo 11) is normal, whereas a transition from Mg- and Fe-rich cores to Fe-poor zones, and finally to Fe-rich rims is preserved in the coarser grained samples (e.g., Apollo 15 sample 15085). Furthermore, several of the samples contain megacrysts (e.g., pyroxene in Apollo 12 sample 12043 and olivine in Apollo 15 sample 15556) that preserve normal zoning with respect to Mg and Fe. Additional SEM-EDS mapping, complemented by quantitative EPMA and LA-ICP-MS analyses, will be utilized in order to 1) evaluate the presence of distinct crystal populations (as determined by morphology, texture, and elemental abundances) and 2) assess the extent to which these populations interacted in open magmatic systems prior to crystallization on the lunar surface.|

The results for the five basalts 10003, 10047, 12004, 12051, and 77135 are consistent with a single-stage exposure. Four basalts, 10057, 10069, 12040, and 12053, experienced a multistage exposure. Using the U-235-Xe-136 dating method, the time of their early exposure to cosmic rays on the lunar surface was dated to have begun three to four aeons ago, immediately after rock formation as defined by their crystallization ages. The durations and shielding depths for the proposed two-stage exposure models of the four basalts were calculated. From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C171

S., Wilkening, L.|Nature Physical Science|233|41|114|LOW energy solar flare protons induce nuclear reactions in barium isotopes in lunar materials and meteorites with the emission of a few nucleons. Such interactions give rise to the possibility that a compositionally distinct component exists in lunar (also in meteorites) xenon. This component is different from the galactic cosmic ray induced component which in general is produced by the emission of several nucleons. In case of radioactive and stable nuclides, it was shown<SUP>1-3</SUP> that the isotope production by solar cosmic rays in the near surface regions of lunar rocks is limited to the top few millimetres while at greater depths the galactic cosmic rays play the major role. The lunar fines, on the other hand, represent an average of both the galactic and solar cosmic ray effects. Indications of solar flare produced isotopic effects in the light rare gases from Apollo 11, 12 fines have been reported by Yaniv et al. in the Apollo 12 Conference at Houston, 1971, and in case of krypton in Apollo 11 fines by Podosek et al.<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we have analysed in detail the Xe data<SUP>5,6</SUP> obtained in the stepwise heating experiments on soil 10,084 and rocks 10,044 and 10,057 from Apollo 11 with a specific aim of understanding the effects of galactic and solar cosmic rays on lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/physci233114a0

B., Simmons, G.|Journal of Geophysical Research|75|32|6524|Presented here are values of dielectric permittivity, dissipation factor, and electrical conductivity of Apollo 11 lunar samples 10020, 10057, and 10046 in the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 MHz and temperature range from -196°C to + 200°C. The dielectric properties determined on earth basalts and a simulated lunar material with the composition of the Surveyor 5 results are used to characterize the dielectric properties of these lunar samples. We conclude that: (1) the lunar samples have higher values of the dielectric constant than terrestrial basalts, an effect due probably to the presence of ilmenite in the lunar samples, and the high-frequency dielectric constant of the lunar igneous samples is about 9 to 15, whereas that of the lunar breccia is about 6 to 9; (2) the lunar samples show greater dielectric losses than terrestrial basalts, and the loss tangents measured on the lunar igneous samples are consistently higher than those of the lunar breccia, ranging from 0.09 to 0.2 for the igneous samples and 0.5 to 0.09 for the breccia; (3) the electrical conductivity values for the lunar samples are 10<SUP>-9</SUP> to 10<SUP>-11</SUP> (ohm cm)<SUP>-1</SUP>, and the electrical conductivity of the lunar igneous samples depends more strongly on temperature than that observed for the lunar brecica; (4) all the lunar samples show a temperature-dependent, low-frequency dispersion that may be due to the combined effect of impurity charges and moisture in the samples that is absorbed from the atmosphere.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB075i032p06524
