We used a seven-layer model consisting of crust, upper mantle, middle mantle, lower mantle, low-velocity layer (LVL), fluid outer core and solid inner core. The model is constrained by the following observations; three selenodetic data of mass, mean moment of inertia, tidal Love number k2 from [1], and Apollo seismic travel time data from [2]. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to infer the model parameters. We collected 140 million samples from 10 chains. Viscosity is not taken into account in this calculation. Mean crustal thickness of 46 ± 4 km is estimated by fitting a normal distribution curve to the posterior distribution, which is to be compared with the previous estimate of 34 - 43 km [3]. Major part of crustal densities is sampled between 2500 and 2600 kg/m3, which is consistent with the value of 2550 kg/m3 reported by [3]. In general, seismic wave velocities in the mantle are consistent with the previous estimates [4][5]. The ranges of size and density of the outer core which satisfy the observation are relatively wide and it is difficult to tightly constrain them. Strong correlation between outer core size and LVL thickness is observed. The smaller outer core should be accompanied by thick LVL and vice versa. When we take into account the upper bound of the fluid core size of 400 km which is predicted by magnetic observation [6], the thickness of the LVL is at least about 100 km. The S-wave velocity within this low-velocity layer is estimated to be less than about 3 km/s. The effect of low viscosity [7] may change the estimate of the S-wave velocity in the LVL. The inner core radius is expected to be smaller than 280 km. The lunar displacement Love number is predicted to be h2= 0.0423 ± 0.0004. References [1] Williams et al.

1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|
1978LPSC....9..495G|1978|The consanguinity of the oldest Apollo 11 mare basalts.|Gamble, R. P., Coish, R. A., Taylor, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||495|The textural, mineralogical, and chemical relationships between three of the oldest dates lunar mare basalt samples returned by Apollo 11 (10003, 10029 and 10062) were investigated. Very strong resemblances were noted between the modal minerologies of 10003 and 10029. Significantly more modal olivine and cristobalite was observed in 10062 than in the other basalt samples. A detailed examination of mineral-chemical relationships among the samples revealed similarities between 10003 and 10062 and differences between these two rocks and 10029, the most significant of which is the presence of akaganeite in 10029, implying that lawrencite was present in the pristine sample of 10029 but not in 10003 and 10062. Results of a Wright-Doherty mixing program used to test various fractional crystallization schemes show that 10062 can be derived from a liquid with the composition of either 10003 or 10029 by removing 2-5% ilmenite and 5% olivine. By removing about 6% plagioclase, 10003 can be derived from a liquid with the bulk composition of 10062. It is concluded that 10003 and 10029 may have come from different basaltic flows, whereas it is possible that 10003 and 10062 were derived from the same parental magma by near-surface fractionation of olivine plus ilmenite or of plagioclase plus or minus olivine.|
