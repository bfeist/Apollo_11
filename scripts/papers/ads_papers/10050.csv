1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|
1971E&PSL..10..245B|1971|A martini-glass clinopyroxene from the moon|Bence, A. E., Papike, J. J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|10|2|245|A vug clinopyroxene from Apollo 11 igneous rock 10050 is a composite crystal having a tabular pigeonite nucleus upon which pigeonite and augite precipitated simultaneously but on different faces. The result is a martini-glass type of sector zoning when viewed along the b-crystallographic axis. Reconstruction of the crystallisation sequence is as follows: crystallization of the tabular pigeonite nucleus (Wo <SUB>9.0</SUB>En <SUB>61.8</SUB>Fs <SUB>26.0</SUB>Other <SUB>3.2</SUB>) followed by the crystallization of subcalcic augite (initially Wo <SUB>33.4</SUB>En <SUB>43.7</SUB>Fs <SUB>17.1</SUB>Other <SUB>5.8</SUB>) on the ((100)), ((010)), and ((110)) faces while pigeonite continued to grow outward from the nucleus parallel to c. As crystallization proceeded, the pigeonite composition changed rapidly towards that of the augite in an unusual (and possibly metastable) trend across the pyroxene quadrilateral. Partition coefficients calculated for the Fe-Mg and (Ti+2Al) - (R <SUP>2+</SUP>+2Si) substitutions are compatible with a preferential incorporation of Fe in the pigeonite and R <SUP>2+</SUP>TiAl <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>6</SUB> in the augite in the initial stages.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90013-6

J.|Science|167|3918|628|Single-crystal x-ray diffraction, microprobe, optical and electron optical examinations of clinopyroxenes from Apollo 11 lunar samples 10003, 10047, 10050, and 10084 show that generally the crystals are composed of (001) augite-pigeonite intergrowths in varying ratios. Transmission electron micrographs reveal abundant exsolution lamellae, many only 60 Ã… thick. In addition to the phase inhomogeneities, primary chemical inhomogeneities are clearly demonstrated. There are reciprocal relationships between calcium and iron and between Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> + 2Al and R<SUP>2+</SUP> + 2Si. Our evidence suggests that a chemically inhomogeneous subcalcic C2/c augite was the only primary pyroxene from which pigeonite later exsolved.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.628
