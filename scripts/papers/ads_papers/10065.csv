1970Sci...167..726K|1970|Elastic Wave Velocities of Lunar Samples at High Pressures and Their Geophysical Implications:|Kanamori, H., Nur, A., Chung, D., Wones, D., Simmons, G.|Science|167|3918|726|Ultrasonic measurement of P and S velocities of Apollo 11 lunar samples 10020, 10057, and 10065 to 5 kilobars pressure at room temperature shows a pronounced increase of velocity (as much as twofold) for the first 2 kilobars. The travel times predicted from the velocity-depth curve of sample 10057 are consistent with the results of the Apollo 12 seismic experiments. At pressures below 200 bars, the samples are highly attenuating; for both P and S waves, the value of Q is about 10.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.726
