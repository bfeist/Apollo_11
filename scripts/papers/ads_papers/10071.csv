1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|
1974GeCoA..38...97E|1974|Noble gas investigations of lunar rocks 10017 and 10071|Eberhardt, P., Geiss, J., Graf, H., Grögler, N., Krähenbühl, U., Schwaller, H., Stettler, A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|38|1|97|The noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe and also K and Ba were measured in the Apollo 11 igneous rocks 10017 and 10071, and in an ilmenite and two feldspar concentrates separated from rock 10071. Whole rock K/Ar ages of rocks 10017 and 10071 are (2350 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (2880 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr, respectively. The two feldspar concentrates of rock 10071 have distinctly higher ages: (3260 ± 60) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (3350 ± 70) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr. These ages are still 10 per cent lower than the Rb/Sr age obtained by PAPANASTASSIOUet al. (1970) and some Ar <SUP>40</SUP> diffusion loss must have occurred even in the relatively coarse-grained feldspar. The relative abundance patterns of spallation Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe are in agreement with the ratios predicted from meteoritic production rates. However, diffusion loss of spallation He <SUP>3</SUP> is evident in the whole rock samples, and even more in the feldspar concentrates. The ilmenite shows little or no diffusion loss. The isotopic composition of spallation Kr and Xe is similar to the one observed in meteorites. Small, systematic differences in the spallation Kr spectra of rocks 10017 and 10071 are due to variations in the irradiation hardness (shielding). The Kr spallation spectra in the mineral concentrates are different from the whole rock spectra and also show individual variations, reflecting the differences in target element composition. The relative abundance of cosmic ray produced Xe <SUP>131</SUP> differs by nearly 50 per cent in the two rocks. The other Xe isotopes show no variations of similar magnitude. The origin of the Xe <SUP>131</SUP> yield variability is discussed. Kr <SUP>81</SUP> was measured in all the samples investigated. The Kr <SUP>81</SUP>/Kr exposure ages of rocks 10017 and 10071 are (480 ± 25) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr and (350 ± 15) × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> yr, respectively. Exposure ages derived from spallation Ne <SUP>21</SUP>, Ar <SUP>38</SUP>, Kr <SUP>83</SUP> and Xe <SUP>126</SUP> are essentially in agreement with the Kr <SUP>81</SUP>/Kr ages. The age of rock 10071 might be somewhat low because of a possible recent exposure of our sample to solar flare particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(74)90197-5
1971E&PSL..13...61D|1971|Petrology of Apollo 11 sample 10071. A differentiated mini-igneous complex|Drake, M. J., Weill, D. F.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|13|1|61|Sample 10071, 33 is a thin section of Apollo 11 ferrobasalt showing an unusual dual texture. The major portion of the sample is very similar to other fine grained Apollo 11 basalts, but the thin section also includes material with a distinct variolitic texture. The two areas are separated by a sharp boundary and the mineralogy and composition of the two textural types are quite distinct. The mineralogy and chemistry of the variolitic portion show it to be the product of rapid cooling of a liquid, intermediate between the typical Apollo 11 ferrobasalt and the associated Si and K-rich mesostasis. This liquid is the result of fractional crystallization of a magma of composition closely corresponding to the major portion of the 10071 system, followed by crystal-liquid separation. The sample provides strong and direct evidence for igneous differentiation on the lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90105-1
