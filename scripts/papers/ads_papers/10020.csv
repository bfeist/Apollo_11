2017PhDT........61N|2017|Copper Diffusion in Silicate Melts and Melt Inclusion Study on Volatiles in The Lunar Interior|Ni, Peng|Ph.D. Thesis||||This thesis focuses on the application of diffusion kinetics to both terrestrial and lunar geochemistry. In Chapters II and III, diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts were experimentally determined and used to discuss the role of Cu diffusion in formation of Cu ore deposits and also Cu isotope fractionation in tektites. In Chapters IV and V, lunar olivine-hosted melt inclusions are studied to understand their volatile loss during homogenization in lab, to estimate cooling rate for lunar Apollo sample 74220, and to estimate volatile abundance in the lunar mantle. Magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type Cu deposits are two major types of Cu deposits that supply the world's Cu. In particular, porphyry-type Cu deposits provide ̃57% of the world's total discovered Cu. Recent studies suggest a potential role of diffusive transport of metals (e.g. Cu, Au, PGE, Mo) in the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type deposits. Diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts, however, are poorly determined. In Chapters II and III of this thesis, Cu diffusion in basaltic melt and rhyolitic melts are studied by diffusion couple and chalcocite "dissolution" methods. Our results indicate high diffusivities of Cu and a general equation for Cu diffusion in silicate melts is obtained. The high diffusivity of Cu indicate that partition of Cu between the silicate phase and the sulfide or fluid phase can be assumed to be in equilibrium during the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits or porphyry-type deposits. In addition, our Cu diffusion data helps explain why Cu isotopes are more fractionated than Zn isotopes in tektites. Volatile abundances in the lunar mantle have profound implications for the origin of the Moon, which was thought to be bone-dry till about a decade ago, when trace amounts of H2O were detected in various types of lunar samples. In particular, high H2O concentrations comparable to mid-ocean ridge basalts were reported in lunar melt inclusions. There are still uncertainties, however, for lunar melt inclusion studies in at least two aspects. One is whether the low H2O/Ce ratios measured in homogenized crystalline inclusions are affected by the homogenization process. The other is that current estimation of volatile abundances in lunar mantle relies heavily on 74220, which is argued to be a local anomaly by some authors. In order to reach a conclusive answer on volatile abundances in lunar mantle, the above two questions have to be answered. To improve our understanding about these questions, in Chapter IV of this thesis, a series of experiments are carried out to understand possible volatile loss from lunar melt inclusions during homogenization. Our results indicate significant H2O loss from inclusions during homogenization in minutes, whereas loss of F, Cl or S is unlikely a concern under our experimental conditions. The most applicable way to preserve H2O during homogenization is to use large inclusions. In Chapter V of this thesis, volatile, trace and major element data for melt inclusions from 10020, 12040, 15016, 15647 and 74235 are reported. Our new data indicate large variation in H2O/Ce ratios from ̃77 to ̃1 across different lunar samples, which is at least partially due to H2O loss on lunar surface during cooling. In addition, evidences were found in F/Nd and S/Dy ratios that might suggest lunar mantle heterogeneity in terms of its volatile abundances.|
2013AGUSMGP24A..05F|2013|Lunar Paleomagnetism|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2013||GP24A-05|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.|

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2012||GP51B-03|Apollo-era paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples suggested that the Moon generated an ancient core dynamo. However, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field was unclear. One group proposed that the lunar dynamo ceased by 3.6 Ga, and that all paleointensity determinations from younger samples were indistinguishable from zero (Cisowski and Fuller, 1986). A second group proposed that the lunar dynamo persisted to at least 3.1 Ga, but surface field intensities declined to values 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those during the period of 3.9-3.65 Ga (Runcorn, 1996). Recent re-analysis of samples 76535, 10020, and 10017 confirm that a lunar core dynamo generated a long-lived, stable magnetic field from 4.2 Ga to at least 3.6 Ga, with ~ 70 μT fields at 3.6-3.7 Ga (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009; Shea et al., 2012; Suavet et al., 2012). Determining when the dynamo ultimately decayed is difficult because retrieving high-fidelity paleointensities for weak fields is difficult for the vast majority of lunar samples due to their poor magnetic recording properties (Tikoo et al., 2012). Thus far, no lunar samples with ages &lt; 3.6 Ga have been reported which unambiguously record a thermoremanence (TRM) acquired while cooling in the presence of a core dynamo-generated field. We investigated the state of the lunar dynamo after 3.6 Ga by studying the natural remanent magnetization of high magnetic fidelity mare basalts 15597 (~ 3.3 Ga) and 12022 (~ 3.2 Ga). Our alternating field and thermal demagnetization as well as rock magnetic data indicate that, by 3.2 Ga, any surface fields on the Moon were too weak (&lt; 7 μT) to be retrieved by our methods. Because our upper limit of 7 μT is consistent with predictions of dynamo scaling laws, it is possible that the lunar dynamo was still active at 3.2 Ga (Dwyer et al., 2011; LeBars et al., 2011). Nevertheless. such weak fields contrast strongly with the 60-70 μT paleointensities inferred for the Moon just 300-400 million years earlier. Furthermore, although Apollo-era paleointensity compilations have identified lunar paleofields ranging from 0.1-10 μT at 3.3 Ga to &lt;200 Ma, we have recently shown that many or all of these values are likely only upper limits (Tikoo et al. 2012).|

However, a longstanding problem has been interpreting the unstable alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior observed in the remaining majority of the Apollo lunar sample suite. Similar unstable behavior has also been observed for many meteorites. It is unclear whether the behavior of these samples indicates that they formed in the absence of an ancient magnetizing field or whether they simply have poor magnetic recording properties. It is necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities in order to determine whether paleomagnetic fields were present on a sample's parent body. To address this issue, we analyzed five samples whose rock magnetic properties span the full suite of observed demagnetization behaviors: mare basalts 15556, 15016, 12017, 10020, and troctolite 76535. We demonstrate that the effects of spurious anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) during AF demagnetization, in combination with multidomain magnetic carriers and magnetic remanence anisotropy, are likely responsible for the apparently poor magnetic behavior of many lunar samples. Therefore, the unstable AF demagnetization behavior observed for many lunar samples is not alone sufficient for ruling out the presence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. Nevertheless, spurious ARM may explain the observation of surprisingly high (≥1 μT) Apollo-era paleointensity measurements for samples thought to have formed after the cessation of a lunar core dynamo (&lt;1.5 Ga).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.05.024

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||GP11B-04|Following the Apollo missions, twenty years of paleomagnetic studies of returned samples have failed to demonstrate unambiguously the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. As a result of new technologies, more robust analytical methods, and a better understanding of rock magnetism, it is now possible to revisit lunar paleomagnetism. A set of criteria that must be met in order to demonstrate that a sample has recorded a core dynamo field has been defined: the samples must not show petrologic evidence of shock, the magnetization must be a stable thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), mutually oriented subsamples should agree in direction and intensity, and the thermal history should be well constrained, with a cooling timescale longer than the lifetime of impact generated fields (&gt;1h). A critical review of the literature has allowed us to identify Apollo samples that are most likely to provide good records of ancient lunar magnetic fields. The first samples to be studied within this framework were troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009) and mare basalt 10020 (Shea et al., 2010), which have recorded a core dynamo field at 4.2 and 3.7 Ga, respectively. Mare basalt 10017 is a fine grained, vesicular, high-K ilmenite basalt with a crystallization age of 3.6 Ga. It was studied by different groups (Fuller and Meshkov, 1979; Hoffman et al., 1979; Runcorn et al., 1970; Stephenson et al., 1977), all of whom noted the stability of its magnetization. We have measured 7 subsamples of chip 10017,378. Their magnetizations agree in direction, with a low coercivity overprint removed by 10 mT AF demagnetization, and a stable high coercivity component consistent with a TRM. Paleointensity estimations give a conservative minimum of 12 μT for the paleofield. This sample is ~100 Myr younger than the end of the late heavy bombardment, which rules out basin-forming impacts as a possible candidate to explain its magnetization. It extends the lifetime of the putative ancient lunar core dynamo well after thermal convection of the liquid core could have sustained an Earth-like lunar dynamo, thereby supporting non-standard dynamo scenarios such as a mechanical-stirring driven dynamo that could have been triggered by lunar librations from Earth tides or by impacts.|
2011AGUFM.P13D1696F|2011|Lunar paleomagnetism: a new analysis of the Apollo-era paleomagnetic measurements|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||P13D-1696|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which are formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully when they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith. Samples 14310, 68416, 77017 and 77135 may have had such simple histories and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models given the small size of the lunar core.|

L., Fuller, M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||DI33B-08|The discovery of remnant magnetization in returned Apollo samples and the lunar crust has long suggested that the Moon has a metallic core and once had a core-dynamo magnetic field (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987). However, the association of magnetization with the antipodes of impact basins suggests that meteoroid impacts may also be the source of lunar magnetization (e.g., Hood and Artemieva, 2008). Distinguishing between these two hypotheses is difficult as most lunar samples are poor recorders of paleomagnetic fields (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987; Tikoo et al., 2010). Since impact-generated shock waves can remagnetize low-coercivity (&lt;~30 mT) grains, samples must have high coercivities and show no petrographic evidence for shock (Gattacceca et al., 2009). Recent paleomagnetic analyses of one lunar sample, troctolite 76535, observed a stable NRM blocked up to &gt;200 mT (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009). The slow cooling timescale of this rock (millions of years) relative the lifetime of impact-produced fields (&lt;1 day maximum) suggests that the moon had a core dynamo at 4.2 Ga. We present a new paleomagnetic study of another high coercivity, unshocked lunar rock, mare basalt 10020. This sample records evidence for lunar magnetism 500 Ma after troctolite 76535. Our results suggest it too has a stable NRM acquired over timescales that are long relative to impact-produced fields. 10020 is a fine-grained, vesicular, ilmenite basalt with a 40Ar/39Ar age of 3.72 ±0.04 Ga that is within error of Rb/Sr crystallization ages of similar composition Apollo 11 basalts (Geiss et al., 1977, Guggisberg et al., 1979). Collinson et al. (1972) and Stephenson et al. 1977 found that a 10020 has one of the most stable NRMs of any studied lunar sample (blocked up to &gt;65 mT). We have now found that two mutually oriented samples of 10020 have a stable (&gt; 65-80 mT) origin-trending unidirectional NRM component. Petrographic analyses of this sample find no evidence for shock such as alteration to maskelynite or fracturing. Pressure remanent experiments on 10020 show that the magnetism could not have been produced by an impact. We therefore suggest that the magnetization recorded in 10020 was generated by a core dynamo. We are currently conducting Ar/Ar dating and further magnetic analyses to further test this hypothesis.|

L., Gattacceca, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||GP43B-1049|Forty years after the Apollo program, the source of the magnetization observed in the lunar crust and in returned samples remains unresolved. The two leading explanations for lunar remanent magnetism are transient magnetic fields created by impact events and the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. In order for a lunar sample to present strong evidence that it acquired its primary remanent magnetism from an ancient lunar dynamo, several criteria should be met. First, the sample should not bear any petrologic evidence of shock, implying a peak pressure of ≤ 5 GPa. Then, during demagnetization experiments, the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) ideally should converge to a stable direction, with intensity decreasing towards the origin. The magnitude and direction of primary magnetic remanence should also agree across mutually oriented subsamples. Finally, the initial cooling timescale for the sample should be ≥ ~1 hour in order to effectively rule out impact events as magnetizing field sources. Recent studies on lunar troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al. 2009) and ilmenite basalt 10020 (Shea et al. 2010) have demonstrated that these samples meet all of the aforementioned criteria and support the possibility that an ancient lunar dynamo existed at 4.2 Ga and 3.7 Ga, respectively. However, the stable magnetic behaviors observed in 76535 and 10020 appear to represent exceptions rather than the rule when compared to the rest of returned lunar samples. The vast majority of lunar samples subjected to paleomagnetic studies display chaotic NRM behavior, evidenced by non-monotonic decline of magnetic moment and unstable directions of magnetization when undergoing demagnetization experiments (see Brecher, 1976). Before a lunar dynamo can be a fully accepted, it is vital to demonstrate that the poor magnetic behaviors evident in the rest of the lunar sample collection do not indicate the absence of a magnetic field. Here we present results of a study which investigates the alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior and magnetic recording capacities of mare basalts 15556, 12017 and 15016. All of these samples appear to be unshocked (peak pressures ≤ 5 GPa) and have cooling timescales longer than the expected duration of impact fields. Our results reveal that these three samples display unstable AF demagnetization behavior. The samples also appear to be imprecise paleointensity recorders of fields with intensities under ~ 30 μT (near the lower bound of the Earth’s present field strength), at least when measured using AF demagnetization. Based on these findings, we posit that many lunar samples are intrinsically unable to preserve robust paleointensity records of magnetic fields when analyzed using AF methods. Therefore, their chaotic demagnetization behavior does not rule out the existence of an ancient lunar dynamo.|

We deduce that the Apollo 11 basalt was erupted with the temperature and composition of a liquid in cotectic equilibrium at low pressure with these six phenocryst mineral species. This condition is a mandatory consequence of the hypothesis that the lunar maria are slowly consolidated giant lava lakes. It is incompatible with the hypothesis that these mare surface basalts, are unaltered partial melts extracted from the deep lunar interior.

Specimens in the form of petrographic thin sections were mounted on polarizing microscopes equipped with three-axis universal stage attachments and inserted into a Cary 17 spectrophotometer. The Apollo 11 pyroxenes with relatively high Ti/Fe ratios were chosen initially to investigate the presence of crystal field spectra of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the minerals. Broad intense bands at about 1000 and 2100 nm. arise from spin-allowed, polarization-dependent transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in pyroxenes. Several weak sharp peaks occur in the visible region. Peaks at 402, 425, 505, 550 and 585 nm. represent spin-forbidden transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions, while broader bands at 460 470 nm. and 650 660 nm. are attributed to Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions. Charge transfer bands, which in terrestrial pyroxenes often extend into the visible region, are displaced to shorter wavelengths in lunar pyroxenes. This feature correlates with the absence of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in these minerals. The magnitudes of the intensity ratios: band 465 nm. (Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>) to band 1000 nm. (Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>) are similar to Ti/Fe ratios from lunar pyroxene bulk chemical analyses, suggesting that an appreciable amount of titanium occurs as Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the lunar pyroxenes. The 505 nm. spin-forbidden peak in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, together with absorption at 465 nm. by Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, contribute to the pink or pale reddish-brown colors of lunar pyroxenes in transmitted lights.
