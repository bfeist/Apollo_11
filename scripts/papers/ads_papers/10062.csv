2021M&PS...56.2211X|2021|Understanding the textures of Apollo 11 high-Ti mare basalts: A quantitative petrographic approach|Xue, Zhuqing, Welsh, Donald F., Neal, Clive R., Xiao, Long|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|56|12|2211|This paper represents a comprehensive crystal size distribution (CSD) study of ilmenite and plagioclase from 12 Apollo 11 basalts from four of the five compositional groups (Groups A, B1, B2, B3, and one unclassified basaltâ€”Group "U" basalt 10062). Ilmenite was saturated in the magma at/before eruption, resulting in subsurface growth of phenocrysts (Group B1) and many small crystals upon eruption. Plagioclase always exhibits linear CSDs representing a single cooling regime in each sample, which is interpreted as crystallizing within isolated magma pockets late in the cooling of the erupted lava flow. Latent heat of crystallization and insulating effects of crystallized phases produced slower cooling and lower plagioclase nucleation densities. Exceptions are the Group B2 and B3 basalts, indicating relatively earlier crystallization of plagioclase on the lunar surface. Our study demonstrates that textures of the Apollo 11 basalts are a product of the interplay among cooling rate, bulk composition, and nucleation density during crystallization. Group A basalts have the highest cooling rates compared to the other Apollo 11 samples (except 10072,53), and were erupted through high effusion rates producing thick flows that underwent extended cooling that induced textural coarsening in both early crystallizing ilmenite and late-stage plagioclase. Group B1 lavas had the lowest effusion rates producing the thinnest flows. The Groups B2, B3, and U basalts are intermediate between these end members. Our approach can be used to define eruption environment, crystallization sequence, and cooling rate of samples collected on the Moon from non-bedrock sources.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13767
1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||495|The textural, mineralogical, and chemical relationships between three of the oldest dates lunar mare basalt samples returned by Apollo 11 (10003, 10029 and 10062) were investigated. Very strong resemblances were noted between the modal minerologies of 10003 and 10029. Significantly more modal olivine and cristobalite was observed in 10062 than in the other basalt samples. A detailed examination of mineral-chemical relationships among the samples revealed similarities between 10003 and 10062 and differences between these two rocks and 10029, the most significant of which is the presence of akaganeite in 10029, implying that lawrencite was present in the pristine sample of 10029 but not in 10003 and 10062. Results of a Wright-Doherty mixing program used to test various fractional crystallization schemes show that 10062 can be derived from a liquid with the composition of either 10003 or 10029 by removing 2-5% ilmenite and 5% olivine. By removing about 6% plagioclase, 10003 can be derived from a liquid with the bulk composition of 10062. It is concluded that 10003 and 10029 may have come from different basaltic flows, whereas it is possible that 10003 and 10062 were derived from the same parental magma by near-surface fractionation of olivine plus ilmenite or of plagioclase plus or minus olivine.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1639|Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd ages of two Apollo 11 mare basalts, high-K basalt 10072 and low-K basalt 10062, are reported. Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Ar-40-Ar-39 ages are in good agreement and indicate an extensive time interval for filling of the Sea of Tranquility, presumably by thin lava flows, in agreement with similar observations for the Ocean of Storms. Initial Sr and Nd isotopic compositions on Apollo 11 basalts reveal at least two parent sources producing basalts. The Sm-Nd isotopic data demonstrate that low-K and high-Ti basalts from Apollo 11 and 17 derived from distinct reservoirs, while low-Ti Apollo 15 mare basalt sources have Sm/Nd similar to the sources of Apollo 11 basalts. Groupings of mare basalt based on Ti content and on isotopic data do not coincide.|

J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|21|3|253|High-titanium basalt collected at the Apollo 11 site was sparsely porphyritic on eruption. Phenocrysts of anorthite are reported for the first time, and were present with a few phenocrysts of olivine, pigeonite, augite, ilmenite and spinel in the liquid. That liquid has a composition which closely resembles the average rock at the site, and also closely resembles new analyses of the liquids produced in equilibrium with anorthite, olivine, pigeonite, augite, ilmenite and spinel in melting experiments at low pressure on samples 10020, 10062 (which are the first of the more abundant low-potassium group lava to have been studied). We deduce that the Apollo 11 basalt was erupted with the temperature and composition of a liquid in cotectic equilibrium at low pressure with these six phenocryst mineral species. This condition is a mandatory consequence of the hypothesis that the lunar maria are slowly consolidated giant lava lakes. It is incompatible with the hypothesis that these mare surface basalts, are unaltered partial melts extracted from the deep lunar interior. Attention is drawn to the consequences of the nearly eutectic character of the crystallization of the high-titanium basalts.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90160-5

A model study to simulate the polycrystalline spectra has been carried out, from which it was possible to ascertain with some degree of certainty the size and shape of the ferromagnetic centers as well as the metallic iron content. Some variations in the metallic Fe content have been noted in these samples, for example, between rocks and fine soil.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(71)90001-9
