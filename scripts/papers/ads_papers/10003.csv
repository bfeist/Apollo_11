The results for the five basalts 10003, 10047, 12004, 12051, and 77135 are consistent with a single-stage exposure. Four basalts, 10057, 10069, 12040, and 12053, experienced a multistage exposure. Using the U-235-Xe-136 dating method, the time of their early exposure to cosmic rays on the lunar surface was dated to have begun three to four aeons ago, immediately after rock formation as defined by their crystallization ages. The durations and shielding depths for the proposed two-stage exposure models of the four basalts were calculated. From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C171
1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||495|The textural, mineralogical, and chemical relationships between three of the oldest dates lunar mare basalt samples returned by Apollo 11 (10003, 10029 and 10062) were investigated. Very strong resemblances were noted between the modal minerologies of 10003 and 10029. Significantly more modal olivine and cristobalite was observed in 10062 than in the other basalt samples. A detailed examination of mineral-chemical relationships among the samples revealed similarities between 10003 and 10062 and differences between these two rocks and 10029, the most significant of which is the presence of akaganeite in 10029, implying that lawrencite was present in the pristine sample of 10029 but not in 10003 and 10062. Results of a Wright-Doherty mixing program used to test various fractional crystallization schemes show that 10062 can be derived from a liquid with the composition of either 10003 or 10029 by removing 2-5% ilmenite and 5% olivine. By removing about 6% plagioclase, 10003 can be derived from a liquid with the bulk composition of 10062. It is concluded that 10003 and 10029 may have come from different basaltic flows, whereas it is possible that 10003 and 10062 were derived from the same parental magma by near-surface fractionation of olivine plus ilmenite or of plagioclase plus or minus olivine.|

The ages of the low titanium rocks found in Oceanus Procellarum and on the eastern edge of mare Imbrium are lower, 3.1-3.4 Ga. There is, however, evidence that high-Ti basalts with lower ages and low-Ti basalts with higher ages occur on the Moon. The observed age spread of rocks even in limited areas suggests that lava flow activity in a basin lasted for several 100 Ma. The age variability of Apollo 11 basalts is particularly well documented: there are at least three different times of rock formation, two for the low-K and one for the high-K rocks. The ages of the oldest mare basalts 10003 (high-Ti, low-K rock) and 14053 (an igneous rock with low-Ti, low-K, high-Al mare basalt composition) of 3.91 ± 0.03 Ga and 3.95 ± 0.03 Ga respectively, suggest that mafic basalt flows had already begun to invade the older basins when the last basin-forming impacts occurred.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.1977.0051

Transmission electron micrographs reveal abundant exsolution lamellae, many only 60 Å thick. In addition to the phase inhomogeneities, primary chemical inhomogeneities are clearly demonstrated. There are reciprocal relationships between calcium and iron and between Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> + 2Al and R<SUP>2+</SUP> + 2Si. Our evidence suggests that a chemically inhomogeneous subcalcic C2/c augite was the only primary pyroxene from which pigeonite later exsolved.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.628
