1972Moon....4...93B|1972|Polarized Absorption Spectra of Single Crystals of Lunar Pyroxenes and Olivines|Burns, Roger G., Huggins, Frank E., Abu-Eid, Rateb M.|Moon|4|1-2|93|Measurements have been made of the polarized absorption spectra (360-2200 nm.) of compositionally zoned pyroxene minerals in rocks 10045, 10047 and 10058 and olivines in rocks 10020 and 10022. Specimens in the form of petrographic thin sections were mounted on polarizing microscopes equipped with three-axis universal stage attachments and inserted into a Cary 17 spectrophotometer. The Apollo 11 pyroxenes with relatively high Ti/Fe ratios were chosen initially to investigate the presence of crystal field spectra of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the minerals. Broad intense bands at about 1000 and 2100 nm. arise from spin-allowed, polarization-dependent transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in pyroxenes. Several weak sharp peaks occur in the visible region. Peaks at 402, 425, 505, 550 and 585 nm. represent spin-forbidden transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions, while broader bands at 460 470 nm. and 650 660 nm. are attributed to Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions. Charge transfer bands, which in terrestrial pyroxenes often extend into the visible region, are displaced to shorter wavelengths in lunar pyroxenes. This feature correlates with the absence of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in these minerals. The magnitudes of the intensity ratios: band 465 nm. (Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>) to band 1000 nm. (Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>) are similar to Ti/Fe ratios from lunar pyroxene bulk chemical analyses, suggesting that an appreciable amount of titanium occurs as Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the lunar pyroxenes. The 505 nm. spin-forbidden peak in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, together with absorption at 465 nm. by Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, contribute to the pink or pale reddish-brown colors of lunar pyroxenes in transmitted lights. The absorption spectral measurements not only provide information on the redox behavior and crystal chemistry of lunar pyroxenes, but also form a basis for interpreting spectral reflectivity properties of lunar rocks and the Moon's surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00562917
1970Sci...167..497G|1970|Instrumental Neutron Activation Analyses of Lunar Specimens:|Gole≈° , G. G., Osawa, M., Randle, K., Beyer, R. L., Jerome, D. Y., Lindstrom, D. J., Martin, M. R., McKay, S. M., Steinborn, T. L.|Science|167|3918|497|Ten Apollo 11 specimens were divided into 24 samples. Sodium contents of 8 diverse specimens cluster tightly about 0.3 percent. Plagioclase separated from sample 10044 contains about 1.09 percent Na; barium is not enriched in the plagioclase separate. Contents of the rare earths are strikingly high, and relative abundances resemble those of calcium-rich achondrites or abyssal basalts but are depleted in Eu by factors of 2 to 3 and in La by about 20 percent. The plagioclase separate is enriched in Eu and pyroxenes and opaque minerals are Eu-depleted. Fine fractions of 10044 are about 20 to 40 percent richer in most rare earths (50 percent for Eu) than coarse fractions, probably because of the presence of small grains in which rare earths are markedly concentrated. "Microgabbro" 10045 is impoverished, relative to the soil, in rare earths and Hf. Ratios by mass of Zr to Hf are comparatively low. Abundances of Mn, Co, Fe, Sc and Cr suggest systematic differences between igneous rocks on one hand and breccias and "soil" on the other. From the Co abundances, no more than about 3 percent of the present "soil" can consist of chondritic meteorite contamination.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.497
