P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2017||GP34A-04|In the 1970s, the first paleomagnetic analyses of lunar samples from the Apollo missions allowed a glimpse of the global evolution of the Moon's magnetic field over time, with evidence for a past dynamo activity [Fuller et Cisowski, 1987]. During the last a decade, a new set of paleomagnetic studies has provided a more refined view of the evolution of the lunar dynamo activity (chronology, intensity) [Weiss et Tikoo, 2014]. The aim of this study is to further refine the knowledge of the lunar dynamo by providing new paleomagnetic data. Based on measurements of the natural remanent magnetization of the main masses of 135 Apollo samples (mass between 50 g and 5 kg) with a portable magnetometer, we have selected nine samples for laboratory analyzes. The selected Apollo samples are: 10018, 15505, 61195 (regolith breccia); 61015 (dimict breccia); 14169 (crystalline matrix breccia); 65055 (basaltic impact melt); 12005, 12021 and 15529 (basalts). Paleointensity of the lunar magnetic fields were obtained by demagnetization by alternative field and normalization with laboratory magnetizations; as well as thermal demagnetization under controlled oxygen fugacity (Thellier-Thellier method) for selected samples. Preliminary results indicate that only three samples (10018, 15505, and 15529) possess a stable high coercivity / high temperature component of magnetization. We estimated the following paleointensities: 1.5 µT for 15505, 13 µT for 15529 (both with alternating field-based methods), and 1 µT for 10018 (thermal demagnetization with the Thellier-Thellier method). The other samples provide only an upper limit for the lunar surface field. These data will be discussed in view of the age of the samples (ages from the literature, and additional dating in progress). References :Fuller, M., and S.M. Cisowski, 1987. Lunar paleomagnetism.
