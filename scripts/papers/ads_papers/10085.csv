2001JGR...10612339K|2001|A new look at the Apollo 11 regolith and KREEP|Korotev, Randy L., Gillis, Jeffrey J.|Journal of Geophysical Research|106|E6|12339|Although the Apollo 11 mission landed in Mare Tranquillitatis, ~50 km from the nearest exposure of highlands, small nonmare particles are conspicuous in the regolith. The nonmare portion of the Apollo 11 regolith is compositionally similar to the Apollo 16 regolith. At both sites most of the nonmare material is from the feldspathic highlands, but some is mafic impact-melt breccia with the chemical signature known as KREEP for its high concentrations of K, rare earth elements, and P. The composition of the Apollo 11 regolith corresponds best to a mixture of 66% crystalline mare basalt, 5% orange volcanic glass, 20% material of the feldspathic highlands, 8% KREEP-bearing impact-melt breccia, and 1% meteoritic material. The volcanic-glass and KREEP-bearing melt-breccia components account for the high concentrations of Mg and Cr in the regolith. The most KREEP-rich sample known from Apollo 11, 10085,1187, is an impact-melt breccia that bears a strong textural and compositional similarity to a unique Apollo 16 melt breccia, 64815. Although not of the maria, such breccias are also not of the highlands provenance. Global data obtained from orbit show that KREEP-bearing materials are most common at low elevations in the Imbrium-Procellarum region and are rare at high elevations. Thus, as at Apollo 16, the KREEP-bearing breccias of Apollo 11 are probably ejecta from the Imbrium impact into the low-lying, Procellarum KREEP Terrane. On the basis of these observation and others, we suggest that the general acceptance of KREEP as a material of the highlands is not supported by the data and results largely from historical accident.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JE001336

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B139|Thirty-eight Apollo 11 lunar highland fragments from coarse fines 10085 have been subjected to petrologic and chemical study. Six major chemical groups are identified: (a) high-K KREEP; (b) anorthosite with a 10X chondrite positive Eu anomaly and anorthosite with 30X positive Eu anomaly; (c) ANT; (d) LKFM; (e) anorthositic gabbro with no Eu anomaly, with a positive Eu anomaly, and with a negative Eu anomaly; and (f) dominant Highland component, 2X-10X chondrite with a positive 10X-14X Eu anomaly. Newly recognized groups are presented based on the REE patterns: (a) ANT group with 5X La and a 22X positive Eu anomaly; (b) 10X flat with 14X positive Eu anomaly; and (c) 2-3X flat with a 10X positive Eu anomaly. The highland suite is very low in K and REE, and is overall quite similar to the Apollo 16 suite.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B139
1980LPSC...11..149G|1980|Classification, experimental petrology and possible volcanic histories of the Apollo 11 high-K basalts.|Grove, T. L., Beaty, D. W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||149|The Apollo 11 high-K basalt samples are classified into three textural categories: vitrophyric, anti-insertal, and antiophitic. Low-pressure phase equilibrium experiments and cooling rate studies were performed on a synthetic analog of 10085, 832. The dynamic crystallization experiments were designed to study textural development with: (1) a variable cooling rate from a constant initial temperature above the liquidus, and (2) cooling at a constant rate from variable initial temperatures below the liquidus. These experiments show that a variety of cooling rates initiated from temperatures both below and above the liquidus can produce all the observed textures. The results are consistent with the interpretation that all of the high-K basalt samples were derived from a single lava flow or lava lake.|

T., Anders, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1537|Radiochemical neutron activation analyses for Ag, Au, Bi, Br, Cd, Cs, Ge, In, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Rb, Re, Sb, Te, Tl, U and Zn were carried out on 11 samples from the Apollo 11 and 12 sites (two samples of rock 12013, one granitic and one KREEPy; 4 KREEP fragments from 2-4 mm soil 12033,2; 4 anorthositic fragments from 1-3 mm soil 10085,104; 1 sample of 'Luny' rock-felsite-KREEP breccia 12013 10085,31 LR-1). Most Apollo 12 samples were found to have an Imbrium meteoritic component; others, typified by the Luny breccia, apparently contain a new meteoritic component of low Re content. Components of higher Ir/Au ratio (3L, 5L and 7) were found in Apollo 11 anorthositic samples; the fact that their enrichment in meteoritic siderophiles parallels that of Fe, Mg, REE and other KREEP elements is consistent with progressive contamination of an anorthositic crust. The Luny rock was tentatively classified Group 2, supporting the assignment of this group to Serenitatis.|
1972E&PSL..16..263T|1972|The composition of the lunar highlands: evidence from modal and normative plagioclase contents in anorthositic lithic fragments and glasses|Taylor, G. J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|16|2|263|Modal analyses of 33 crystalline anorthositic fragments from Apollo 11 soil sample 10085,24 are reported. Their plagioclase contents range from Ìƒ48 - 100 wt %, with a broad peak at about 80 wt %. These compositions contrast with those of anorthositic glass particles that are present in the soil at every landing site. The latter have a smaller range of compositions and average about 70 wt % normative plagioclase; they are chemically equivalent to anorthositic gabbros. The results of the Surveyor VII alpha-scattering experiment and the Apollo 15 X-ray fluorescence measurements indicate that the lunar highlands are more heterogenous than the anorthositic glass data indicate, and at least two regions have substantially higher Al/Si ratios (0.78 and 0.73) than the glass (0.66). These areas are thus more feldspar-rich than the glass fragments, and so are more similar to the region sampled by the Apollo 11 crystalline anorthosites. It is concluded that the fragments of crystalline anorthosites present a more realistic picture of the composition of the lunar highlands than do the glasses. Data on the relative abundances of crystalline particles and their chemically equivalent glasses in Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 soil show that glass particles are distributed over much wider areas of the Moon than are crystalline fragments. The anorthositic gabbro glass, therefore, may have been formed by a few impacts, possibly only one, that dispersed glass fragments over large areas of the lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(72)90200-2

The crystalline lithic fragments in the coarse fines and microbreccias represent a closely related suite of gabbroid igneous rocks that have a wider range of modal analyses and textures than seen in the larger crystalline rock samples returned by Apollo 11. Petrographic evidence of shock metamorphism is common, and the abundant glass is almost all shock-produced. None of the glass observed is similar to tektite glass.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3918.650
1970Sci...170..969W|1970|Lunar Anorthosites: Rare-Earth and Other Elemental Abundances|Wakita, Hiroshi, Schmitt, Roman A.|Science|170|3961|969|Elemental abundances of major (Ti, Al, Fe, and Ca), minor (Na, Mn, and Cr), and trace elements [14 rare-earth elements (REE), Y, In, Cd, Rb, Cs, Ba, Co, and Sc] in lunar anorthosites separated from Apollo 11 sample 10085 coarse fines have been determined by means of instrumental and radiochemical neutron activation analysis. The REE distribution pattern of lunar anorthosites, relative to ordinary chondrites, has a positive Eu anomaly. On the assumption that (i) the lunar composition is similar to that of ordinary chondritic meteorites low in total Fe (~ 13 percent); (ii) lunar anorthosites are derived from highland cratering events and are representative of the highlands; and (iii) the moon differentiated into olivine, hypersthene, and basaltic and anorthositic phases, and plagioclase crysstallization began after ~ 93 percent solidification, then mass balance calculations yield ~ 30-kilometer and ~ 10-kilometer thicknesses for the lunar highlands for the melting and chemical differentiation of the entire moon and of the upper 200 kilometers, respectively. Corresponding thicknesses of the basaltic basement rocks were ~ 5 kilometers and ~ 2 kilometers, respectively. Alternatively, if the anorthosites of this study are representative of the highlands and the onset of plagioclase crystallization occurred after ~ 50 percent solidification of the initially melted moon, calculations with REE and Ba partition coefficients suggest that the REE and Ba abundances in the primeval moon were similar to those observed in basaltic achondrites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.170.3961.969
