A., Nace, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||433|Petrographic data on twelve Apollo 15 surface samples and on twelve samples from the double drive tube 15010/011 are presented in the form of triangular AML (agglutinate-monomineralic fragments-lithic fragments) plots. The triangular AML plots for different grain sizes show smoothly varying contour lines only for the solids derived mainly from mare basalts. These contour lines are interpreted as lines of isomaturity. The AML plots with isomature contours are somewhat similar to QFR (quartz-feldspar-rock fragments) triangular plots used for terrestrial clastic sediments. Both kinds of plots are sensitive to maturity and both may be used to predict evolution paths. Soils from predominantly highland areas and from other mixed terrains at Apollo 15 sites do not make smooth contours on AML diagrams. By analogy with QFR diagrams, the lack of smooth contours may be due to mixed source rock families, or to recent mixing, or both.|

S., Nace, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||475|Modal analysis data are presented for six samples from the upper part of the Apollo 15 lunar core 15010/011 in order to further investigate the maturation profile of the core and to estimate the source rock contribution. The core data are compared with those of the adjacent soils 15531 and 15601. The soils analyzed are relatively immature and remarkably homogeneous. Surface soil 15531 is the most immature one, which is attributed to the fact that it was sampled from the rim of a relatively recent 3 m-diameter crater and thus contains an admixture of fresh bedrock material ejected by this cratering event. The major source of rock contribution to the soils is from petrographically identifiable mare basalts (about 89% to the core and to 15601 and about 87% to 15531). Olivine basalts and quartz normative basalts occur in an approximate ratio of 3:1; contributions of KREEP basalts and the Front are relatively minor.|
