2008GeCoA..72.5799R|2008|Pb/Pb geochronology, petrography and chemistry of Zr-rich accessory minerals (zirconolite, tranquillityite and baddeleyite) in mare basalt 10047|Rasmussen, Birger, Fletcher, Ian R., Muhling, Janet R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5799|In situ U-Pb isotopic measurements were carried out by ion microprobe on the Zr-rich accessory minerals zirconolite [CaZrTi <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>7</SUB>], tranquillityite [Fe <SUB>8</SUB><SUP>2+</SUP>(ZrY) <SUB>2</SUB>Ti <SUB>3</SUB>Si <SUB>3</SUB>O <SUB>24</SUB>] and baddeleyite [ZrO <SUB>2</SUB>] in low-K, high-Ti mare basalt 10047 collected during the Apollo 11 mission. The analysed minerals are concentrated in pockets of late-stage mesostasis that comprises an intergrowth of silica, barian K-feldspar and Si-Al-K glass, from a phaneritic, subophitic, basalt comprising mainly pyroxene, plagioclase, ilmenite, cristobalite and troilite. Most Zr-rich minerals are unaltered, however, some tranquillityite is replaced by a complex intergrowth of zirconolite, baddeleyite, ilmenite and fayalite, suggesting that the mineral became unstable during crystallization. Several baddeleyite crystals have also undergone alteration to secondary zircon. Zirconolite was analysed in thin section 10047,11 and tranquillityite and baddeleyite in 10047,227, using a ̃6 μm primary ion beam. Both zirconolite and tranquillityite have significant U and low initial Pb contents, and are highly suitable for Pb/Pb dating. Fifteen analyses of zirconolite give a <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3708 ± 7 Ma ( <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb: <SUP>204</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb isochron; 95% confidence, including renormalisation of ratios) and twenty-five analyses of tranquillityite give 3710 ± 6 Ma. The <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb dates are consistent with each other and refine results from an earlier study. Baddeleyite data were less precise, mainly due to lower secondary ionisation efficiency. Our results show that zirconolite and tranquillityite can provide precise isotopic dates and, given their presence in other samples, they represent important U-Pb chronometers for refining lunar geology.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.09.010
1993LPI....24..725J|1993|A Monazite-bearing Clast in Apollo 17 Melt Breccia|Jolliff, Bradley L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||725|A phosphate-rich clast in a pigeonite-plagioclase mineral assemblage occurs in Apollo 17 impact-melt breccia 76503,7025. The clast, measuring 0.9 x 0.4 mm in thin section, contains 3.3 percent (volume) apatite (Ca5P3O12(F,Cl)), 0.8 percent whitlockite (Ca16(Mg,Fe)2REE2P14O56), and trace monazite ((LREE)PO4). Major minerals include 26 percent pigeonite, En53-57FS34-35W08-13, and 69 percent plagioclase, An84-92Ab7-15Oro.6-1.1. Troilite, ilmenite, and other accessory minerals constitute less than 1 percent of the assemblage and Fe-metal occurs along fractures. Also present in the melt breccia as a separate clast is a fragment of felsite. Based on the association of these clasts and their assemblages, a parent lithology of alkali-anorthositic monzogabbro is postulated. Monazite occurs in the phosphate-bearing clast as two less than 10 micron grains intergrown with whitlockite. The concentration of combined REE oxides in monazite is 63.5 percent and the chondrite-normalized REE pattern is strongly enriched in LREE, similar to lunar monazite in 10047,68 and terrestrial monazite. Thorium concentration was not measured in monazite, but based on oxide analyses of approximately 100 percent (including interpolated values for REE not measured), substantial Th concentration is not indicated, similar to monazite in 10047,68. Measured monazite/whitlockite REE ratios are La: 11, Ce: 8, Sm: 3.6, Y: 0.9, and Yb: 0.5. Compositions of monazite and coexisting whitlockite and apatite are given.|

The results for the five basalts 10003, 10047, 12004, 12051, and 77135 are consistent with a single-stage exposure. Four basalts, 10057, 10069, 12040, and 12053, experienced a multistage exposure. Using the U-235-Xe-136 dating method, the time of their early exposure to cosmic rays on the lunar surface was dated to have begun three to four aeons ago, immediately after rock formation as defined by their crystallization ages. The durations and shielding depths for the proposed two-stage exposure models of the four basalts were calculated. From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C171
1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|

M., Peckett, A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1|Previously unpublished (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) ages and exposure ages are presented for Apollo 11 whole rocks and mineral separates. The age data for the Apollo 11 mare basalts in general are discussed in relation to their textural and petrological properties. The oldest rocks (10003, 10029) belong to the low-K group and crystallized at 3.90 + or - 0.03 AE. Three other low-K groups are defined in relation to the petrological classification of Beaty and Albee (1978) and to information on the rock crystallization ages, exposure ages and normative quartz contents. These groups have ages of 3.84 + or - 0.04 AE (10062), 3.75 + or - 0.03 AE (10050) and 3.72 + or - 0.04 AE (10044, 10047, 10058). The best defined (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) age for the high-K basalts is 3.62 + or - 0.05 AE (for mineral separates from 10072). At least four distinct, fairly thin flows of low-K basalt are believed to have been erupted over a 200-my period, followed by either one or several, as yet indistinguishable, very thin flows of high-K basalt. It is not possible to decide whether the earliest dated of the mare basalt eruptions at Mare Tranquillitatis pre-dated, post-dated, or were contemporary with the Imbrian impact event.|

W., Britten, R.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|21|2|164|Thorium-poor monazite occurs as an inclusion in a ferrohedenbergite grain within a mesostasis area of the relatively coarse-grained Apollo 11 basalt 10047,68. Only a single grain of monazite (̃ 4 × 15 μm) has been observed but it is possible that monazite may exist as a more significant phase at smaller grain sizes. Electron probe analyses indicate chondrite-normalized REE fractionation patterns for both lunar and terrestrial monazites in which the light REE's (La to Sm) are highly enriched relative to the heavy REE's (Gd to Lu). Lunar monazite shows a distinct Eu anomaly which is absent from the terrestrial sample. Crystallization of monazite from late-stage liquids forming during crystallization of lunar igneous rocks could lead to these liquids becoming increasingly depleted in the light REE's relative to the heavy REE's.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90050-8

Specimens in the form of petrographic thin sections were mounted on polarizing microscopes equipped with three-axis universal stage attachments and inserted into a Cary 17 spectrophotometer. The Apollo 11 pyroxenes with relatively high Ti/Fe ratios were chosen initially to investigate the presence of crystal field spectra of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the minerals. Broad intense bands at about 1000 and 2100 nm. arise from spin-allowed, polarization-dependent transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in pyroxenes. Several weak sharp peaks occur in the visible region. Peaks at 402, 425, 505, 550 and 585 nm. represent spin-forbidden transitions in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions, while broader bands at 460 470 nm. and 650 660 nm. are attributed to Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions. Charge transfer bands, which in terrestrial pyroxenes often extend into the visible region, are displaced to shorter wavelengths in lunar pyroxenes. This feature correlates with the absence of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in these minerals. The magnitudes of the intensity ratios: band 465 nm. (Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>) to band 1000 nm. (Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>) are similar to Ti/Fe ratios from lunar pyroxene bulk chemical analyses, suggesting that an appreciable amount of titanium occurs as Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> ions in the lunar pyroxenes. The 505 nm. spin-forbidden peak in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, together with absorption at 465 nm. by Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, contribute to the pink or pale reddish-brown colors of lunar pyroxenes in transmitted lights. The absorption spectral measurements not only provide information on the redox behavior and crystal chemistry of lunar pyroxenes, but also form a basis for interpreting spectral reflectivity properties of lunar rocks and the Moon's surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00562917

Transmission electron micrographs reveal abundant exsolution lamellae, many only 60 Å thick. In addition to the phase inhomogeneities, primary chemical inhomogeneities are clearly demonstrated. There are reciprocal relationships between calcium and iron and between Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> + 2Al and R<SUP>2+</SUP> + 2Si.

C., Durrieu, L., Jouret, C., Maurette, M.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|9|5|391|Some habit and texture features of the finest and uncrushed grains in the lunar dust samples 10084 and 12070, were studied with the 1 MeV electron microscope of the Institut d'Optique Electronique du C.N.R.S., Toulouse, France. These features were then compared with those observed in broken fragments extracted either from lunar rocks 10047 and 12063 or from different types of meteorites (Orgueil; Pesyanoe, Shergotty). The finest fraction of the Apollo 11 lunar soil samples is constituted of about 80% of well ordered but rounded crystals which are frequently overlaid by a thin skin of amorphous material. In the Apollo 12 soil the grains are coarser, the fraction of crystalline material is higher (̃90%) and the proportion of crystals showing an amorphous skin is smaller, but both lunar soil samples are very different from meteoritic or lunar rock matter. Some implications of the present results concerning the fabric of the finest fraction of the lunar regolith, the ancient solar wind and meteoritic research are briefly outlined.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(70)90003-8
