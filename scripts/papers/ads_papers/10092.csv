1980LPSC...11...49R|1980|chemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts.|Rhodes, J. M., Blanchard, D. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||49|A reexamination of the bulk major and trace element geochemistry of Apollo 11 low-K mare basalts is presented. New analyses are given for seven previously unanalyzed samples (10003, 10020, 10044, 10047, 10050, 10058, and 10062) and for two low-K basalts (10029 and 10092) and one high-K basalt (10071) for which comprehensive compositional data were previously lacking. The data show that three distinct magma types have been sampled, as proposed by Beaty and Albee (1978), and that these magma types are unrelated by near-surface crystal fractionation. Each magma type is characterized by distinctive magmaphile element ratios, which enable previously unclassified samples (10050 and 10062) to be assigned to an appropriate magma type.|
