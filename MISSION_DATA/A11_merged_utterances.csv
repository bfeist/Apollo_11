-004:17:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We're in a built-in hold at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. We expect to resume our countdown at about 48 minutes from this time at 6:02am, Eastern Daylight Time. All elements of the Apollo 11 countdown are GO at this time. We're heading for a planned liftoff on the Apollo 11 mission at 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The prime crew for Apollo 11 is Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin. Were awakended ... just about an hour ago, at 4:15am, Eastern Daylight. At this time, after successfully completing a ... determination, they're sitting down for breakfast. The breakfast menu, the usual astronaut fare on launch day, of orange juice, tenderloin steak, scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee. Joining the prime crew for breakfast are two members of the Apollo 11 team who have worked with the astronauts during their preperation. The first is the Director of Flight Crew Operations, the astronauts Bob Donald K. Slayton, and the second member joining the crew for breakfast, astronaut Bill Anders. Bill Anders has served as the backup Command Module Pilot during all preparations for the Apollo 11 mission. Anders, of course, did fly the 3rd seat on the first mission - manned mission to the moon, Apollo 8 back last December. Anders was a member of that crew. Astronaut, Bill Anders also shortly will assume the position as Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics Space Council. So, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and Backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders having breakfast with the prime crew at this time. Following breakfast, the crew will go into their final preparations donning their space suits. They're not expected to depart from their crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre for the trip to the launch pad for another hour and 10 minutes or so. Meanwhile, here in Firing Room 1 at the Launch Control Centre Complex 39, all going well as the team here in the firing room continues to monitor the status of all the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle during this phase of the built-in hold. Shortly, a close-out crew of four crewmembers will be sent to the pad, they will go up to the 320-foot level where the Apollo 11 Command Module is located, and proceed to open the hatch of the spacecraft which has been closed during the propellant loading phase of the launch vehicle. The crew, which includes the astronaut, Fred Hayes, will then make some preliminary preparations for the arrival of the prime crew for Apollo 11 who will come aboard later in the count. That is our status at this time, once again to repeat: the astronauts now sitting down for breakfast having their usual breakfast of steak and scrambled eggs. Joining them, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, and the backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Bill Anders. We're still in our planned built-in hold, 3 hours and 30 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004:00:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We remain in our built-in hold on the Apollo 11 countdown of T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. We plan to resume the count at two minutes after the hour. All elements of the Apollo 11 countdown are proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin, winding up breakfast at this point in their crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre. They're joined for breakfast by Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, and Bill Anders, the backup Command Module Pilot. Before proceeding to breakfast and sitting down for the usual astronaut menu on launch day of steak and scrambled eggs, the crew underwent a brief physical examination by doctors Allan C. Harder and John Teegan. The crew was described as appearing to be rested, fit as a fiddle, and ready to go. Here in the firing room of Complex 39, the crew continuing to monitor the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We've loaded more than 3/4 of a million gallons of liquid oxygen / liquid hydrogen aboard the three stages of the Saturn V since the countdown resumed late last evening. Weather forecast also very acceptable for a launch attempt this morning. The forecast called for scattered clouds at altitudes about 15000 feet in the Kennedy Space Centre area. Visibility will be 10-15 miles. Winds in the launch area at launch time, from the southeast at 5-10 knots. The sea state off Cape Kennedy is satisfactory. And weather in round the world track, the various contingency areas required during the powered phase of the mission, all weather conditions acceptable around the track. We are GO, but we remain in our planned, built-in hold at this time. The astronauts, according to the countdown procedures, should be ready to depart from their crew quarters at about 6:25am Easter Daylight this morning to start the 8-mile trip to their spacecraft located on the 320-foot level at the launchpad. We're at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes of our built-in hold. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003:50:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We remain in our built-in hold on the Apollo 11 countdown of T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. Expecting to resume the count now about 22 minutes from this time at 2 minutes past the hour. All aspects of the countdown remain in a GO condition at this time. Latest report from the crew quarter here at the Kennedy Space Centre, the prime crew, astronauts Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin have completed their breakfast and are proceeding to the suit room which is on the west side of the crew quarters in the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at KSC. Shortly, they'll be donning their flight suits and going through the regular checkouts of the suits in preparation for the departure to the launch pad. Which, according to the countdown schedules, shortly after 6:25am Eastern Daylight Time. In preparation for the crew departure the test supervisor, Bill Schick, gave a GO for the closeout crew to proceed to the launch pad. This is a team of 4 individuals who will go up to the 320-foot level at the pad itself where the Apollo 11 spacecraft hatch is located. This hatch has been closed during the propelland loading procedures that have been in progress for most of the morning. The closeout crew consists of the pad leader, a Command Module technician, a quality control specialist, and the backup Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Fred Hayes. Shortly after the hatch is opened astronaut Hayes will go aboard and make some preliminary checks in preparation for the arrival of the prime crew. Here in the firing room we continue to monitor the status of more that 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants that have been brought onboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. The propellant loading one of the major milestones over the final portions of the count--at least over the last 9 hours. This has been the major task that's been in progress since the count was resumed late last evening. All aspects of Apollo 11 countdown proceeding satisfactorily as we remain in our planned built-in hold at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003:31:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, but we are about to resume our count shortly. We expect to resume the count a little less than one minute from this time. We have been in a planned built-in hold of 1 hours and 32 minutes duration and it appears that all aspects of the mission are ready to resume the Apollo 11 countdown shortly, now about 25 seconds away. The crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin in the suit room at the crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre donning and checking out the pressure suits. At the launch pad at the 320-foot level, the hatch of the Apollo 11 Command Module was opened about 10 minutes ago. The backup Lunar Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Hayes, expected to go aboard the spacecraft shortly to make some preliminary checks. We're going to resume our count shortly.
-003:30:01|P|PAO|MARK. T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and counting. We're counting on Apollo 11. All elements GO at this time. Aiming for a planned liftoff at 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. The astronaut crew expected to depart from their quarters about 24-25 minutes from this time to start the 8-mile trip to the launch pad. They'll be boarding the spacecraft starting at about the 2 hour, 40 minute mark of the count. All is GO with Apollo 11 at this time at 2 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003:16:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We just past the 3 hour, 16 minute mark in our countdown and we are proceeding at this time. Kennedy Control Centre launch team continuing to monitor the status of the various propellants now all aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The Apollo 11 prime crew of astronauts Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin finishing up their preparations in the suit room on the west side of the crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre. If the count continues to go well, I suspect that the astronauts will depart the building some 10 minutes or so from this time to start the 8-mile trip to the launch pad--going up to the 320-foot level at the pad, the location of the hatch for their Command Module. This is Kennedy Launch Contro, T-minus 3 hours, 15 minutes, 3 seconds and counting.
-003:04:36|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 4 minutes, 32 seconds and counting. Right on time as far as the astronaut's countdown is concerned, the prime crew now departing from their crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and then counting Michael Collins plus the two technicians and Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton now boarding the transfer van for the trip to the launch pad. Slayton, actually, will drop off from the transfer van as it passes by here at the Launch Control Centre. The trip in the transfer van should take some 15 minutes to reach the pad, at which time the crew will board the first of two elevators for the trip to the 320 foot level at the launch pad where they will then proceed to ingress the spacecraft. At the present time, the backup Lunar Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Hayes, is already aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft performing some preliminary checks. This work includes checking the chlorine content of the water supply and adjusting the cabin lights inside the spacecraft in preparation for the arrival. We logged the departure from the building at about 6:27am Eastern Daylight Time. The transfer van now departing from the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at the Kennedy Space Centre on the start of it's 8-mile trip to launch pad A here at complex 39 where the Saturn V launch vehicle, now fully loaded with propellants and the spacecraft going through preliminary checkouts. Right now our count at 3 hours 3 minutes and counting aiming toward the planned liftoff time at 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. This is launch control.
-003:00:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 1 minute and counting. We are proceeding with the Apollo 11 countdown at this time. The prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin on the way to the launch pad in their transfer van. Just about 4 minutes ago the crew boarded the transfer van at their crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre to start the trip of about 8 miles to launch pad A, and finally to the 320-foot level above the launcher where their Command Module is located and where they will start a boarding process into the spacecraft at about 2 hours and 40 minutes in the count. Weather conditions are GO for the launch, astronauts on their way to the launch pad, the crew here in the firing room continuing to monitor the status of almost a million gallons of propellants that are aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle at this time. We're continuing to replenish the supply of the oxygen and hydrogen as we continue down the count. 2 hours, 59 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. This is Kenndy Launch Control.
-002:46:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 2 hours, 45 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. As the prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin are on the ... part of their trip to the launch pad in the transfer van--it's now making the curve toward the pad, we have discovered a problem at the launch pad itself as the crew is about to arrive. We have a leak in a valve located in a system associated with replenishing liquid hydrogen for the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This is a piece of ground support equipment, actually. It is not on the rocket itself. It's located on the tower of the mobile launcher at the 200-foot level. This valve is leaking. We had a problem with this same valve during our countdown demonstration test previously. We have sent a team of three technicians and a safety man to the pad and these technicians are now tightening bolts around the valve. Once the technicians depart, we will send hydrogen again through this system to assure that the leak has been corrected. The astronauts are now coming up toward the pad itself as the crew of several technicians at the 200-foot level proceed to tighten some bolts around a leaking valve. Once again, this valve is associated with the system that replenishes liquid hydrogen for the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Because of the extremely low temperatures of the hydrogen, it continues to boil off during these phases of the count, and we continue to replenish this supply down the final moments of the count to assure that we have 100% aboard. The crew is working on the valve at this time--the crew went in a short time ago, and they're going to be followed shortly by the astronaut team which has just arrived at the pad--the transfer van now backing up toward the elevator. In a matter of 5 minutes or so, we'll be ready for the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong to come across the sil at the 320-foot level. That is our status at 2 hours, 43 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is launch control.
-002:40:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 40 minutes, 40 seconds and counting. At this time, the prime crew for Apollo 11 has boarded the high-speed elevator from inside the A-level in the mobile launcher, which is the second level inside the launcher. This is a high-speed elevator, 600 feet-per-minute, which will carry them to the 320 foot level, the spacecraft level. Shortly, we'll expect astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to come across swing-arm 9, the Apollo access arm, and proceed to the white room and standby to board the spacecraft. The third member of the crew, astronaut Edwin Aldrin, will be the last one to board the spacecraft, will standby in the elevator seated in a chair, while his two comrades first board the spacecraft. Once Armstrong, who sits in the left-hand seat, and Collins who will sit in the right-hand seat during liftoff are aboard, then Aldrin will be called and he will take his seat--the middle seat in the spacecraft. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong and the Command Module Pilot, Michael Collins now proceeding across the swing-arm into the small white room that attaches at the spacecraft level. In the mean time, about 100 feet below, we have a technician--a team of technicians working on a leaking valve which is a part of the ground support equipment, a part of the system that's used to replenish the fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. He is proceeding to tighten a series of bolts around this valve in the hope that this will correct the leak. Once the technicians do depart, the hydrogen will again be flowed through the system to assure that the leak has been corrected. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, and CMP--the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins now standing by in the white room. T-minus 2 hours 38 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Launch Control.
-002:34:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 34 minutes, 44 seconds and counting. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong now aboard the spacecraft at the 320 foot level, at the pad. We had it logged, having the commander going over the sill, into the cabin at 6:54am, Eastern Daylight. Since that time, the commander has now been tied into the system and has checked in over the communication lines. He was wished a good morning by the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, and Armstrong in return said "it looks like a good morning". In the mean time, 120 feet below him, the technicians continuing to work to tighten bolts around a leaking valve associated with the system that replenishes hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage. To repeat once again, this is not a problem with the launch vehicle itself, but on the ground support equipment associated with it. T-minus 2 hours 33 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:30:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. Right on the hour, the Command Module Pilot, astronaut Michael Collins, who will be sitting on the right-hand side of the spacecraft during liftoff, boarded the spacecraft. We have it logged at 7:00am, Eastern Daylight Time. The 3rd member of the crew, Buzz Aldrin, standing by in the elevator around the corner along the swing-arm from the white room and the spacecraft at the 320 foot level. 120 feet below, technicians still working on some bolts that surround a leaking value that is associated with a system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. Our countdown proceeding at this time coming up to the 2 minute - 30 second - the 2 hour, and 30 minute mark in the count. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:23:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 23 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. The 3rd member of the Apollo 11 prime crew, now aboard the spacecraft. We had it logged at 7:07am Eastern Daylight Time when astronaut Buzz Aldrin boarded the spacecraft. He will sit in the middle seat during liftoff. As Lunar Module Pilot, his normal position would be on the right-hand side. However, due to crew preference we have the Command, of course, Neil Armstrong sitting on the left-hand side, the Lunar Module Pilot for the overall flight, Buzz Aldrin, sitting in the middle seat, and the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, sitting in the right-hand seat at liftoff. Down below at the 200-foot level, are technicians still hard at work at tightening bolts around a valve associated with the system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This is ground support equipment located on the tower at the pad at the 200-foot level. He continues to work at the 200-foot level as the crew in the white room does the same with the three astronauts aboard. We actually have a 4th astronaut still aboard the spacecraft at this time, astronaut Fred Haise who is the backup Command Module Pilot. He is in the lower equipment bay of the spacecraft giving a helping hand to the three prime crewmen as they start to perform some of their preliminary checks here as we head down over the final 2 hours - 2 1/2 hours of the countdown. We're at T-minus 2 hours, 22 minutes, 11 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:20:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 2 hours, 21 minute mark in our coutdown, and we are proceeding at this time. At the 320-foot level, all three astronauts now aboard the spacecraft. Just a few minutes ago, astronaut Buzz Aldrin came in and took the center seat to join Neil Armstrong on the left, and Mike Collins on the right. These are the positions they will fly at liftoff. During the process of getting the astronauts checked in to the spacecraft, communication cables must be attached to their suits. They also have to hook into the suit circuit system of the spacecraft that brings oxygen into their suits. They are helped by a fourth astronaut onboard, the backup Command Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Haise, is in the lower equipment bay, and one of the suit technicians who's located behind them, to give a hand as they check in. We've heard from Neil Armstrong and now we've also heard from Mike Collins on comm checks, and we're standing by for further reports as checkout continues. 120 feet down, the work continues on a leaky valve on the 200-foot level. This is ground support equipment - the technicians still hard at work tightening bolts around that valve at this time. 2 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:10:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 10 minutes, 35 seconds and counting. At the 320-foot level, the 4th astronaut aboard the spacecraft regretfully leaves at this time. Astronaut, Fred Haise, is about to come out after giving the three prime crewmen a hand in their preliminary checkouts aboard. Haise will be coming out shortly. In the mean time, 120 feet below, where we had that problem with the leaky valve, the technicians have completed their work and they are in the process now of departing from the launch pad. In a short while we'll start flowing hydrogen again, back through the general replenishing system to continue to off up the supply of the hydrogen fuel in the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong, has completed a series of checks called Abort Advisory System checks. This is where certain key crewmen on the ground, members of the launch team, can send signals to the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft - light cues that would indicate difficulty during the flight in which he could take abort action if he determined that such action was necessary. These checks have been completed and Neil Armstrong confirm that the lights came on in the console in front of him - the panel in front of him as these lights were operated from the ground here in the Launch Control Center. All still going well with our count, we will standby as we again, bring hydrogen back to the 3rd stage, we will see how that operates, we're now at 2 hours, 9 minutes, 4 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:07:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 7 minutes and counting. At this time, we're just in the process of closing the hatch on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Several of the closeout crew shook hands with the astronauts, and then proceeded to close the hatch on direction from the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin. We had it logged as the hatch being closed and tightened - still being tightened right at this time which is 25 minutes past the hour. Once the hatch is closed, we will start a cabin to condition the cabin inside. The three astronauts, of course, are on pure oxygen in their spacesuits on the suit circuit. We will produce a cabin atmosphere in the spacecraft of a 60/40 combination, 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. This is the atmosphere used for liftoff. Once that is accomplished, the closeout crew will be ready to put the boost protective cover on the hatch and continue with their closeout. The hatch being close at this time, we are proceeding. We'll standby to see how our hydrogen condition is as far as replenishing the hydrogen fuel supply with the 3rd stage to the Saturn V. 2 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:00:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control, we're at T-minus 2 hours, 55 seconds and counting. We're approaching the 2-hour mark in our countdown, and we appear to be proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The crew aboard the spacecraft, the 320-foot level - the hatch is closed and we're beginning to purge the cabin to bring it to the proper atmosphere for launch with is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen. 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen atmosphere. Of course, the astronauts themselves are breathing pure oxygen through their spacesuits. Coming up shortly will be another key test in which both the launch crew for both the launch vehicle crew and the spacecraft team combine together with the command, Neil Armstrong, to make a thorough check of the Emergency Detection System. This is the system that will signal the astronauts in the cabin if anything goes wrong below them. We use the ground-based computer to accomplish this test. As rather lengthy as these tests go using a computer, it will take some 30 minutes. Neil Armstrong will be doing most of the work in the spacecraft, responding as different cue lights signifying different difficulties are presented to him. The abort panel, of course, is across from the commander on the left-hand side, the left front, of the spacecraft. Our countdown continuing, T-minus 1 hour, 59 minutes, 34 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:51:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 50 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. We're proceeding with the countdown of the Apollo 11 mission at this time, and it's going satisfactorily. At this point, the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong in the process of working the Emergency Detection System test. This is a test of the Emergency Detection System working with the launch crew here in the firing room, and also the spacecraft team and Control Rooms back at the Manned Spacecraft Operations building here at the Kennedy Space Center. All going well with these tests at the present time, we're flowing hydrogen back into the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, after having difficulty with that leaking valve. It appears that we are bypassing the use of the valve directly in loading the hydrogen aboard, but we are getting hydrogen back in to replenish the supply. All appears to be going well at this time. Weather is GO. We're coming up on 1 hour and 50 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:40:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 1 hour, 40 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactory at this time, as we lead up to what our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, continuing this extensive series of checks of the Emergency Detection System, working with both the launch vehicle test crew, and the spacecraft crew. This is a key test, and a very thorough test to assure ourselves before we commit to liftoff, that all the emergency detection techniques inside the launch vehicle are operating properly here on the ground so if required in flight, the spacecraft commander and, of course, his two fellow astronauts, could be signaled of a difficulty inside the rocket and could take proper abort action as required. Thus far, the three astronauts aboard the spacecraft have just been giving business-like responses back to the directions and checks, working with the spacecraft conductor Skip Chauvin as he runs down his procedures as the countdown continues. We're at T-minus 1 hour, 39 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. This is Launch Control.
-001:31:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All elements are GO with the countdown at this time, the countdown aimed at landing two astronauts on the Moon. At this time the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, going through some checks with astronaut Mike Collins aboard the spacecraft. We're winding up this important Emergency Detection System test that Neil Armstrong has been participating in. Meanwhile, at the 320-foot level the closeout crew now placing the boost protective cover over the hatch now that we have completed the cabin purge and have the proper environment inside the cabin. We have also performed leak checks to assure ourselves that the cabin atmosphere is valid. This boost protective cover is used during the early phases of the powered flight and it is jettisoned with the escape tower shortly after second stage ignition. Here in the firing room the launch vehicle test team's still keeping a close eye on the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We're back to 100 percent supply with the liquid hydrogen fuel in the third stage. This problem with the leaking valve is no problem at this time. We've actually bypassed the valve that we are maintaining our hydrogen supply aboard the vehicle. All aspects GO, the weather is very satisfactory for launch this morning, a thin cloud cover about 15,000 feet, temperature at launch time expected to be about 85 degrees. T-minus I hour, 29 minutes, 30 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:21:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 20 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All is still GO with the countdown for Apollo 11 at this time. At this point in the countdown Spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, once again, appears to be the busiest worker in the spacecraft as he is performing a series of alignment checks associated with the guidance system in the spacecraft. He is working these checks with the Spacecraft Test Conductor as the test conductor reads out the various procedures and Armstrong responds to them. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft also were informed by the spacecraft conductor a short while ago that the launch vehicle is GO at this time. The hydrogen problem that we did encounter earlier has been solved. "That is real good news", said Armstrong and then he went back to work shortly thereafter. We are now coming up on the 1 hour, 20 minute mark in the countdown. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:12:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T-minus one hour, 11 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown for Apollo 11 still going very satisfactorily at this time. In most cases, we're a matter of 5 or 10 minutes ahead of the countdown procedures. The crew in the white room at the 320-foot level who have been aiding the astronauts up to this time are just in the process of finishing up their work. They've been advised by the Spacecraft Test Conductor that they'll probably be able to move out in about 3 minutes or so. Once this is accomplished, once the close-out crew does depart, we'll be ready to move that swing-arm back - swing-arm 9. It will be moved 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch, this is about 5 feet away from the hatch. Once this is accomplished, we will arm the pyrotechnic systems in the spacecraft so in the event of a possible catastrophic condition below them, with the launch vehicle, while still on the pad, the astronauts could fire that escape rocket and separate from the rocket in difficulty. The crew - close-out crew are about to depart at this time. That swing-arm remains about 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch as mentioned - 5 feet or so until the 5-minute mark in the count when it's fully retracted to it's fall-back position. The obvious reason here is in the event we do have to get the astronauts out in a hurry, the swing-arm is in a stand-by position and could be moved rapidly back to the hatch - to the hatch level so the astronauts could depart in the event of an emergency. We're coming up on T-minus 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 20 seconds. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:07:29|P|PAO|This is Apollo Launch Control at 1 hours 7 minutes 25 seconds and counting. Countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. For those people who would like to synchronize their watches in relation to the count, we'll synchronize on 26 minutes past the hour, which is now about 65 seconds away. We'll count down the last 5 seconds to 26 minutes past the hour. We're now 1 minute away from 26 minutes past the hour. In the meantime, we do have information from the Civil Defense Agency in the area. The estimate is more than a million persons are in the immediate area in Brevard County to watch the launch. Now 40 seconds away from 26 minutes past the hour. Civil Defense Agency reports further that there is extensive heavy traffic, a number of traffic jams, particularly in the area of Titusville and the U.S. 1 and Route 50. Countdown still progressing satisfactorily. 15 seconds away from 26 minutes.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 8:26am Eastern Daylight Time. We're now 1 hour 5 minutes 55 seconds and counting, as it was announced at that point. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:01:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn launch control. T-minus 61 minutes and counting - T-minus 61 minutes on the Apollo 11 countdown, and all elements are GO at this time. Astronaut, Neil Armstrong has just completed a series of checks on that big service propulsion system engine that sits below him in the stack. We want to assure ourselves before liftoff that that engine can respond to commands from inside the spacecraft. As Neil Armstrong moved his rotational hand controller we assured ourselves that the engine did respond by swiveling or gimballing. This of course, is important for maneuvers in space. The countdown is still proceeding very satisfactorily other than two minor problems essentially picked up the count at 11pm Eastern Daylight Time last night, all has gone well. As we approach the one hour mark now, in the count a series of radio frequency and telemetry checks will be in progress with the launch vehicle. We'll also check out the tracking beacons in the instrument unit that travels as a guidance system for the Saturn V during the powered phase of flight. Now 59 minutes, 48 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy launch control.
-000:55:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have just passed the 56-minute mark in our countdown. We are still proceeding in an excellent manner at this time. All elements reporting in that all systems continuing to look good at this point. We are still aiming toward our planned liftoff at the start of the lunar window 9:32am Eastern Daylight. A short while ago, in fact the Spacecraft Test Conductor - we are doing quite well, in fact some 15 minutes ahead on some aspects of the preparation spacecraft-wise. Armstrong replied that was fine, "just as long as we don't launch 15 minutes early." Obviously referring to the start of the window. The countdown still going well, T-minus 55 minutes, 10 seconds in counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:50:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have passed the 51 minute mark in our countdown. We're now T-minus 50 minutes 51 seconds and counting. Apollo 11 countdown is still GO at this time, all elements reporting ready at this point in the countdown. The spacecraft - correction - the Test Supervisor, Bill Schick has advised all hands here in the Control Center and the spacecraft checkout people that in about 30 seconds that big swing arm that has been attached to the spacecraft up to now will be moved back to a parked position some 5 feet away from the spacecraft. We alert the astronauts because there is a little jolt when the swing arm is moved away. It will remain in that position, some 5 feet away from the spacecraft, until the 5 minute mark in the count when it's completely pulled away to its retracted position. It's coming up now in 5 seconds, the swing arm will come back. Mark. The swing arm now coming back from the spacecraft. Countdown proceeding satisfactorily, we've completed our telemetry checks with the launch vehicle and at this point with the swing arm back we arm the pyrotechnics so that escape tower atop the astronauts, atop their spacecraft, could be used if a catastrophic condition was going to occur under them with the launch vehicle from this point on down in the countdown. We have the high speed elevator located at the 320 foot level in the event the astronauts have to get out in a hurry. This is a special precaution. One of the members of the support team for Apollo 11, Astronaut Bill Pogue, is here in the firing room. He acts as Capsule Communicator during the countdown. His call sign is Stoney. He controls that elevator. He now has it locked at the 320-foot level. These are special precautions for safety purposes during the final phase of the count. Now coming up on the 49-minute in the countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:46:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 46-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 45 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. All elements still GO the countdown at this time. The hard work on the spacecraft at this point in the countdown - Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat. He's been working with the Spacecraft Test Conductor on setting up proper switch settings in preparation for pressurizing their Reaction Control System. These are these big thrusters on the side of the Service Module. There's actually 16 of them in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. They are used for maneuvers in space. We pressurize that system before liftoff. That particular operation will be coming up in some 5 minutes or so. In preparation for it, Buzz Aldrin, who has most of the switches in front of him has been preparing for that particular event. The launch vehicle people keeping an eye on the status of the various propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. Just at liftoff, we will have a vehicle weighing close to 6-1/2 million pounds on the launch pad. There's more than a million gallons of propellants aboard the 3 stages of Saturn V. The reports here in the Control Center are the propellants are stable. They did look a little while ago at the RP-1, the high-grade kerosene fuel that's used in the first stage of the Saturn V to make sure it was at it's top level. We keep an eye on these various aspects throughout the count, and use the aid of computers to keep an overall look on general status. So now at T-minus 44 minutes, 21 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:40:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. We've passed the 41-minute mark in our count. T-minus 40 minutes, 53 seconds and counting. We are continuing, and we're continuing very excellently at this time. There are no problems that have been reported in as the countdown continues to click down. We're still aiming for the start of our window on this, the first flight to land Man on the Moon. Our - we're aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. Coming up shortly will be a key test here in the firing room. As far as the launch vehicle people are concerned, it's a - some final checks of the destruct system aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. In the event during powered flight that the vehicle strayed rather violently off course, the Range Safety Officer could take action to destroy the vehicle. This obviously would occur after the astronauts were separated by their escape tower from the faulty vehicle. We make a check of the destruct system to assure that if the signal is required to get through that, in fact, it will. This is what is coming up here in the Control Center at this time. All aspects of the mission still GO at T-minus 39 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy launch control.
-000:35:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 36-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 35 minutes, 48 seconds and counting. We've completed those Range Safety command checks. All still going well with the countdown. A short while ago Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, asked Neil Armstrong if the crew was comfortable up there and Neil reported back. He said it's - "we're very comfortable, it's very nice this morning". For a status report, we'll now switch to Mission Control, Houston.
-000:35:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Mission Control. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth's team is on station here in the Mission Operations Control Room, ready to assume the control of this flight at tower clearance. There is a possibility that Apollo 11 will check out the Command Module color TV camera during the first Earth revolution while in contact with the Goldstone station. If this checkout does occur, we acquire Goldstone at 1 hour, 29 minutes elapsed time. We have loss of signal at 1 hour, 33 minutes, 50 seconds elapsed time. This TV camera checkout is a possibility. This is Mission Control, Houston.
-000:30:59| P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 31 minute mark in our count. At T-minus 30 minutes 52 seconds and counting, aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 32 minutes past the hour, the start of our launch window on this, the mission to land men on the Moon. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactorily at this time. We've got by an important test with the launch vehicle checking out the various batteries in the 3 stages and instrument unit of the Saturn V. We remain on external power through most of the count to preserve those batteries which must be used during the powered flight. We've just taken a look at them by going internal and then switching back to external again. The batteries all look good. The next time we go internal will be at the 50 second mark with those batteries and they will remain, of course, on internal power during the flight. The Lunar Module, which has been rather inactive during these latter phases of the count also is going on internal power at this time on the 2 batteries on the Ascent Stage and the 4 batteries on the Descent Stage. For the next 20 minutes we'll take a look at some systems in the Lunar Module, then power down at about the 10-minute mark in the count, power down the telemetry to preserve the power of the LM. The Lunar Module on Apollo 11, of course, when it separates from the Command Module in lunar orbit, will have the call sign Eagle. The Command Module call sign, once the 2 vehicles separate, will be Columbia. Both Columbia and Eagle are GO at this time at 29 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:26:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 26 minute mark in the count, T-minus 25 minutes 53 seconds and counting, still proceeding very satisfactorily. At this time, Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin working with Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat covering the final pressurization of the Reaction Control System for the spacecraft. These are those big thrusters on the side of the Service Module that are used for maneuvers in space. Each one of these thrusters is capable of 100 pounds of thrust, there are 16 of them located in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. We pressurize the system with helium prior to launch to make sure that all will be in readiness for use in space. The countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. We picked up at the T-minus 9 hour mark at 11:00pm. Eastern Daylight Time last evening. We've just had 2 comparatively minor problems since that time. The major portion of the countdown during the early morning hours, some 5 hours of work was taken, to load the various propellants aboard the stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. As we came into the count this morning we did already have the fuel aboard the first stage, but it was necessary to bring the liquid oxygen aboard all 3 stages and the liquid hydrogen fuel aboard the second and third stages. Close to 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants were loaded during these 5 hours. Following that the astronauts, the prime crew, were awakened at 4:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight as planned in their countdown, and proceeded to have their physical examination in which they were declared flight ready. They sat down for the normal astronaut fare on launch day as far as breakfast is concerned, orange juice, steak, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. The 3 pilots were joined by 2 of their colleagues at breakfast, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and the backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders who has been named the Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The astronauts departed from their crew quarters - after checking out their suits, they departed from the crew quarters at 6:27am and some 27 minutes later, 8 miles away from the crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center a top the launch pad at complex 39, 6:54am. the commander, astronaut, Neil Armstrong, was the first aboard the spacecraft. He was followed about 5 minutes later by Mike Collins and finally Buzz Aldrin, the man who is sitting in the middle seat during liftoff, was the third astronaut to come aboard. Two minor problems have been encountered during the count - early in the count a malfunction light came on here in the Control Center indicating that we might have a communication problem at the launch pad. Nothing to do with the spacecraft, but it indicated we possibly might not be able to talk to some key technicians we had at the pad. The problem turned out to be very minor, a simple adjustment of some equipment beneath the pad remedied the problem. There was no, in fact, no equipment problem involved. The second problem, we did encounter a leaky valve in part of the equipment that is used to replenish the hydrogen fuel supply on the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. A team of technicians were sent out to the launch pad, at about the time the astronauts were traveling to the pad. They tightened some bolts and we were able to bypass this valve and to proceed with our countdown. The weather is certainly GO. It's a beautiful morning for a launch to the Moon. We expect a temperature of about 85 degrees in the Kennedy Space Center area. The winds about 10 miles - 10 knots, rather from the southeast, and the weather conditions in the round-the-world track, according to reports to the Manned Space Flight Meteorology Group indicate all weather conditions are acceptable for launch. That's our general status. We've Just passed the 22 minute mark in the count. 21 minutes 55 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:16:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We are now less than 16 minutes away from the planned liftoff for the Apollo 11 space vehicle. All still going well with the countdown at this time. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft have had a little chance to rest over the last few minutes or so. At least they haven't been busy with procedures with the Spacecraft Test Conductor. In the meantime we have been performing final checks on the tracking beacons and the instrument unit which is used as a guidance system during the powered phase of flight. Once we get down to the 3-minute and 10-second mark in the countdown, we'll go on an automatic sequence. As far as the launch vehicle is concerned all aspects from there on down will be automatic, run by the ground master computer here in the firing room. This will lead up to the 8.9-minute mark in the countdown when the ignition sequence will begin in those five engines of the first stage, the S-IC stage of Saturn V. At the 2-second mark we'll get information and a signal that all engines are running and at the zero mark in the countdown once we get the commit signal, the signal that says that the thrust is proper and acceptable, we then will get a commit and liftoff as the hold-down arms release the vehicle. We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upwards, a vehicle that weighs close to 6-1/2 million pounds. We are now 14 minutes and 30 seconds and counting and this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:11:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 11-minute mark. Now T-minus 10 minutes 54 seconds on our countdown for Apollo 11. All still GO at this time. The astronauts in the spacecraft busy again. The Commander, Neil Armstrong, has performed some final switch settings for the Stabilization and Control System of the spacecraft. The spacecraft also now is on full internal power. This came shortly after the 15-minute mark. Spacecraft now on the full power of it's fuel cells. Up to this time, it had been sharing the load with an external power source. Both Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have armed their rotational hand controllers - the controllers they use in flight and we have now gone to automatic system with the Emergency Detection System. That system - it would cue the astronauts if there's trouble down below with the Saturn V rocket during the powered flight. We're now coming up on the 10-minute mark. 10 minutes away from our planned liftoff. MARK. T-minus 10 minutes and counting, T-minus 10. We're aiming for our planned liftoff at 32 minutes past the hour. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:05:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. We've passed the 6 minute mark in our countdown for Apollo 11. Now 5 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. We're on-time, at the present time, for our planned lift off of 32 minutes past the hour. Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin now has completed the status check of his personnel in the Control Room. All report they are GO for the mission, and this has been reported to the Test Supervisor, Bill Schick. The Test Supervisor now going through some status checks. Launch Operations Manager, Paul Donnelly, reports GO for launch. Launch Director, Rocco Petrone, now gives a GO. We're 5 minutes, 20 seconds and counting. Coming up shortly that swing arm up at the spacecraft level will come back to its fully retraced position. It should occur at the 5-minute mark in the count. In the meantime the Lunar Module telemetry has been powered down. We took a good look at Eagle, and it looks good. The Spacecraft Test Conductor for the Lunar Module reported that Eagle was GO. The swing arm now coming back to its fully retracted position as our countdown continues. T-4 minutes, 50 seconds and counting. Skip Chauvin informing the astronauts that the swing arm now coming back. The astronauts will have a few more reports coming up in the countdown. The last business report will be from Neil Armstrong at the 45 seconds mark in the count when he gives the status on the final alignment of the Stabilization and Control System. We're now passing the 4 minute, 30 second mark in the countdown - still GO at this time.
-000:04:16|P|PAO|4 minutes and 15 seconds. The Test Supervisor now has informed Launch Vehicle Test Conductor, Norm Carlson, you are GO for launch. From this time down, Carlson handles the countdown as the launch vehicle begins to build up. We're now hitting the 4-minute mark. 4 minutes and counting. We are GO for Apollo 11. We'll go on an automatic sequence as standing at 3 minutes and 7 seconds. Three minutes, 45 seconds and counting. In the final abort checks between several key members of the crew here in the Control Center and the Astronauts. Launch Operations Manager, Paul Donnelly wished the crew on and the launch teams we have, "good luck and Godspeed". Three minutes, 25 seconds and counting. We're still GO at this time. We'll be coming up on the automatic sequence in about 10 or 15 seconds from this time. All still GO at this time. Neil Armstrong reported back when he received the good wishes, "Thank you very much. We know it will be a good flight." Firing command coming in now. We are on the automatic sequence. We're approaching the 3-minute mark in the count. T-minus 3 minutes and counting. T-minus 3 - we are GO with all elements of the mission at this time. We're on an automatic sequence as the master computer supervises hundreds of events occurring over these last few minutes. T-minus 2 minutes, 45 seconds and counting.
-000:02:44|P|PAO|The members of the launch team here in the Control Center monitoring a number of what we call red-1ine values. These are tolerances we don't want to go above and below in temperatures and pressures. They're standing by to call out any deviations from our plans. Two minutes, 30 seconds and counting. We're still GO on Apollo 11 at this time. The vehicle starting to pressurize as far as the propellant tanks are concerned, and all is still GO as we monitor our status for it. 2 minutes, 10 seconds and counting.
-000:02:07|P|PAO|The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, the Moon, at liftoff we'll be at a distance of 218,096 miles away. Just passed the 2-minute mark in the countdown. T-minus 1 minute, 54 seconds and counting. Our status board indicates that the oxidizer tanks in the second and third stages now have pressurized. We continue to build up pressure in all three stages here at the last minute to prepare it for liftoff. T-minus 1 minute, 35 seconds on the Apollo mission, the flight to land land the first men on the Moon. All indications are coming in to the Control Center at this time indicate we are GO. One minute, 25 seconds and counting. Our status board indicates the third stage completely pressurized. 80 second mark has now been passed. We'll go on full internal power at the 50 second mark in the countdown. Guidance system goes on internal at 17 seconds leading up to the ignition sequence at 8.9 seconds. We're approaching the 60 second mark on the Apollo 11 mission.
-000:01:01|P|PAO|T-minus 60 seconds and counting. We have passed T-minus 60. 55 seconds and counting. Neil Armstrong just reported back, "It's been a real smooth countdown." We have passed the 50-second mark. Our transfer is complete. We're on internal power with the launch vehicle at this time.

000:31:03|O|LMP|Okay. Just leave the dark slide with it?
000:31:08|O|CMP|Well, I thought about ... the dark slide or something, and then I thought we might need it later for a magazine change; so, I left it with it.

000:35:49|O|CMP|Yes.
000:35:50|O|LMP|About with that white mark?
000:35:51|O|CMP|Yes, one's for the 18, and one's for the 75; I – I think just as long it looks like it's out and ... the window, that's the main thing.

000:46:45|O|CDR|I can see some stars. Well, maybe I ...
000:46:53|O|CMP|Okay, again, looking through the telescope, I'm absolutely unable to tell if it's Nunki, but I have it in the sextant - so let's mark on it.

000:48:01|O|LMP|Copy.
000:48:02|O|CMP|Okay. Now I - I - If I remember right, I think you're just supposed to torque without further ado. We give them the time at which we torque. So, as soon as you got them written down, let me know and I'll proceed and you can mark the time.

000:48:18|O|CMP|Okay, now I - I'm going to verify with the third star, and let's see what that star's going to be. Star number 34 - -
000:48:34|O|LMP|Atria - -
000:48:35|O|CMP|- - is Atria. You might note that, Buzz, also. I think - -
000:48:38|O|LMP|34?
000:48:39|O|CMP|Yes, I think that's the third star; it'll say somewhere in that checklist. Proceed to Atria. Alright, if IMU is realigned, realign the GDC. Okay.
000:49:04|O|LMP|We're 0.1 degree? Probably GDC's off a lot more than that.
000:49:11|O|CMP|Okay, and Atria is there in the sextant. Well, you know, it's not right in the middle of the sextant. Of course, I guess - I don't know what - Have you ever heard any rules on what constitutes a good third star check?
000:49:32|O|LMP|No, all you're really doing is seeing that you've got the right stars, it seems to me.
000:49:36|O|CMP|It's there, but it's not dab-smack in the middle of the sextant; it's off, I would guess - 0.02 or some crazy number like that. Alright, having done that, VERB 37, ENTER; ... ENTER, and I'm going OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL, and cranking up the floodlights down here.
000:50:04|O|CMP|God, I'll tell you, the visibility through that telescope is a big disappointment.
000:50:09|O|LMP|It's ...
000:50:13|O|CMP|Okay, Buzz, got all that good stuff?
000:50:20|O|CDR|GDC's realigned, okay -
000:50:26|O|CMP|Reticle brightness ... I don't know anything about that. ... Stow optics eyepieces, okay, that's in work.
000:50:35|O|CDR|And ... out there right now. ... , Buzz?
000:50:46|O|LMP|Neil, I haven't been looking out - My eyes aren't very well adapted.
000:50:52|O|CDR|You got your light on.
000:50:58|O|CMP|Yes, look at those bright ones down here.
000:51:09|O|LMP|Lightning! Is that lightning out your window?
000:51:12|O|CDR|No, I haven't seen any lightning.
000:51:14|O|LMP|Hell, that must be lightning. Either that or it's the ...
000:51:19|O|CMP|You know, no matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces - -
000:51:22|O|CDR|I just saw something. Maybe it is the ... They said that Borman's ... could see it; they couldn't hear it, but they could see it alright -
000:51:30|O|LMP|Yes.
000:51:34|O|CMP|No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right.
000:51:44|O|CMP|0.01, God damn it! Now that's enough to piss somebody off.
000:51:50|O|CDR|... that time.
000:51:52|O|LMP|S-band noise.
000:51:56|O|CDR|We're about to get - 10 seconds until acquisition.
000:51:01|O|LMP|Okay.
000:52:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 52 minutes and the station at Carnarvon, Australia is about to acquire Apollo 11. We'll stand by live for this pass.
000:52:04|O|CMP|Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.
000:52:08|O|CDR|You want me to take your checklist, Mike, and kind of skim through it?
000:52:15|O|CMP|It says here, coming up on Carnarvon LOS at - -
000:53:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Over.
000:53:07|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Loud and clear. Over.
000:53:11|T|CC|Roger, 11. We're reading you the same. Both the booster and the spacecraft are looking good to us. Over.
000:53:25|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like to copy the alignment results?
000:53:30|T|CC|That's affirmative.
000:53:34|T|LMP|Okay. NOUN 71: we used 30 and 37, four balls 1; NOUN 93: plus 00016, plus 00033, plus 00152; GET 00:48:15; check star 34. Over.
000:54:02|T|CC|Roger. Say again check star.
000:54:06|T|LMP|Check star 34.
000:54:09|T|CC|Roger. We copy. And the angles look good.
000:54:13|T|CMP|And tell Glenn Parker down at the Cape that he lucked out.
000:54:17|T|CC|Understand. Tell Glenn Parker he lucked out.
000:54:21|T|CMP|Yes. He lucked out. He doesn't owe me a cup of coffee.
000:54:25|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. We'll pass it on.
000:54:33|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin giving the report and Mike Collins chiming in that at the last with the no cup of coffee report.
000:57:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Carnarvon; AOS at Honeysuckle 59:33. Over.
000:57:36|T|CDR|Apollo 11. Roger.
000:57:39|T|CC|Roger. And we request you turn up S-band volume for the Honeysuckle pass.
000:57:39|T||HONEYSUCKLE (REV 1)
000:59:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal at Carnarvon. However, the station at Honeysuckle in Australia will acquire Apollo 11 in approximately a minute. We'll continue to stand by through the Honeysuckle pass.
001:02:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston on S-band. Radio check. Over.
001:02:54|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 reads you loud and clear.
001:02:58|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Reading you the same. Out.
001:03:02|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong in the radio check.
001:04:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. A little over 1 minute to LOS at Honeysuckle. You'll be AOS at Goldstone at 1:29:02; LOS at Goldstone 1:33:55. Over.
001:04:44|O|CMP|Let - let me tell them about the TV ...
001:04:46|T|CMP|Roger, Bruce. Thank you. We expect TV. We've got it all hooked up. We have not yet turned it on. We're ready to do that now.
001:04:46|O|CMP|Roger, Bruce. Thank you. We expect TV. We've got it all hooked up. We have not yet turned it on; we're ready to do that now.
001:04:54|T|CC|Roger. We copy. We'll be configured and waiting for whatever you want to send down.
001:04:54|T||GUAYMAS (REV 1)
001:05:02|O|CMP|Okay, you think we can do that?
001:05:04|O|LMP|That's fine with us.
001:05:05|O|CDR|This one here?
001:05:17|O|LMP|Tell them that we've got nothing to do here but recheck it here for the next 20 minutes or so.
001:05:26|O|LMP|Okay. I'm ready to turn the TV on. Play with it. ... flashlight ... hook it up ...
001:05:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour 6 minutes into the mission of Apollo 11. Honeysuckle has lost signal. Mike Collins reported just prior to LOS here that the crew would check out the TV camera at the Goldstone station. Goldstone will acquire Apollo 11 at 1 hours 29 minutes 2 seconds and will lose the spacecraft at 1 hour 33 minutes 55 seconds. We'll come back up just shortly prior to acquisition at Goldstone. This is Mission Control Houston.
001:06:00|O|CDR|Want a - ...? Mike?
001:06:01|O|LMP|No.
001:06:03|O|CMP|Yes, I'd love one, Neil; thank you. I just stuck it in my pocket.
001:06:15|O|CMP|Can I give you the wrapping back?
001:06:18|O|CDR|(Laughing) Now that is a problem, trying to find - -
001:06:21|O|CMP|It's a gooey one. Gooey when the paper doesn't want to come off, but thanks anyway. ...
001:06:54|O|CMP|What was you doing there? (Laughter)
001:06:56|O|LMP|I don't know ... I almost lost it. I figured I'd really go along with the ... and put some of that ointment on - so slick that I rubbed my ring off (laughter).
001:07:08|O|CDR|Is that right?
001:07:09|O|LMP|Yes.
001:07:18|O|CMP|Have we got any daylight? I can't see outside at all.
001:07:21|O|CDR|Nothing yet, ...
001:07:26|O|LMP|How are you going to rig that up, Michael?
001:07:28|O|CMP|Well, Buzz, I'm going to hold it out that hatch window.
001:07:31|O|LMP|Handhold it?
001:07:32|O|CMP|Yes - yes, yes, handhold it; don't dick with that.
001:07:37|O|CDR|Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor; have you run ...?
001:07:40|O|CMP|Yes.
001:08:09|O|CDR|Mike, how about this thing?
001:08:11|O|CMP|REPRESS - let's see, it's supposed to be - 865.
001:08:22|O|LMP|Go ahead.
001:08:23|O|CMP|And it - it kind of varies - not 865, but it's - 830.
001:08:34|O|CDR|...
001:08:37|O|CMP|Well, I don't know how - that ought to ...
001:08:44|O|CDR|I can turn - turn it on FILL for a minute, if you like. That's what we need to do, I think.
001:08:51|O|CMP|Maybe the ... this son-of-a-bitch is working or not.
001:09:06|O|CDR|You got the power switches turned on up there at the - -
001:09:10|O|CMP|Yes. ...
001:09:21|O|LMP|Why don't you have me the Hasselblad ... get the right settings on it.
001:09:26|O|CMP|Okay.
001:09:29|O|LMP|Is Goldstone the only station that's going to get this?
001:09:31|O|CDR|Yes, that's all. That's the only one that's got a scanner converter. We've only got about 4 minutes, looks like.
001:09:42|O|LMP|That must be doing something.
001:09:45|O|CMP|Yes.
001:09:47|O|CDR|How long - -
001:09:48|O|CMP|You got it on infinity for one thing; let me put it down here.
001:09:50|O|CDR|- - how long is it supposed to take to - -
001:09:53|O|CMP|...?
001:09:54|O|CDR|No, no, it's the one with the ...
001:09:59|O|LMP|Okay, it's - it's working somewhat; it's just the question of not enough light in here when I get it.
001:10:06|O|CDR|Yes.
001:10:07|O|LMP|... It's, I think, working okay.
001:10:12|O|CDR|We ought to be coming out into the daylight here in a little bit. ... We can get it all shaped up.
001:10:22|O|LMP|I think it's alright. Now the one thing I forget about this is this zoom.
001:10:30|O|CMP|Do we want to write on this what - what we're taking pictures of? 0.5 millimeter. ... planet, but I -
001:10:44|O|LMP|Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5 millimeters to 75; I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoomed - -
001:10:58|O|CDR|I would think so.
001:10:59|O|LMP|- - and 12.5 is wide angle.
001:11:01|O|CDR|Yes.
001:11:02|O|LMP|The only thing that confuses me is that it says for vehicle to vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view, probably. That's why they said that, rather than telephoto.
001:11:15|O|CMP|Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.
001:11:18|O|LMP|Okay. You didn't touch this lighting?
001:11:21|O|CMP|No, I didn't ... Minimum ...
001:11:29|O|LMP|I've got bright.
001:11:31|O|CMP|Focus, I'll put at infinity, and the f-stop for vehicle to vehicle is - -
001:11:58|O|CDR|Not much light in here.
001:12:02|O|CMP|- - f 2.8.
001:12:04|O|LMP|What?
001:12:09|O|CMP|Okay. I - I'll show what it looks like inside of the cabin. Okay, let's change all the settings I have in there ...
001:12:27|O|LMP|Okay, this looks alright, I think.
001:12:29|O|CMP|Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yes, we'll get it. If you can't see it worth a shit, what's the difference? You want to see the monitor?
001:12:40|O|LMP|...
001:12:42|O|CMP|Yes. You want to see the monitor? ...
001:12:48|O|CDR|Is this all ready to go; I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz.
001:13:01|O|LMP|Yes. ...
001:13:05|O|CDR|Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.
001:13:13|O|LMP|Okay.
001:13:14|O|CDR|There are two pieces on the back of them ...
001:13:17|O|LMP|You think so, huh?
001:13:18|O|CDR|Yes, over, just a little up toward the ...
001:13:28|O|LMP|Now, ... better off .... It's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down.
001:13:53|O|CDR|I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.
001:13:58|O|LMP|Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to - know which way to move it.
001:14:06|O|CDR|Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.
001:14:24|O|LMP|Hey, there's something. How's that window? ...
001:14:34|O|CDR|When you get around there, Buzz, I'll give you the briefing (laughter). You just slid out of your - -
001:14:48|O|LMP|I was out of my ...
001:14:58|O|CMP|Handkerchief or something - -
001:14:59|O|LMP|Where do we have to go to get a tissue?
001:15:02|O|CMP|All the way down to the ...
001:15:05|O|CDR|How about - using a piece of cloth, like - -
001:15:11|O|LMP|While I'm here, let me - -
001:15:13|O|CMP|What - what - do you want a tissue for?
001:15:15|O|CDR|Hey, that's a good idea. We can get rid of that stuff - -
001:15:17|O|LMP|You're damned right.
001:15:20|O|CDR|- - that's a good idea; good head.
001:15:23|O|LMP|Brilliant ...
001:15:24|O|CDR|I got your checklist, Mike; you want it back?
001:15:27|O|CMP|Yes, I'll take it back, Neil - Thank you, just put it here.
001:15:38|O|CMP|No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me BUZZ'S.
001:15:42|O|CDR|Excuse me.
001:15:44|O|CMP|... I'd rather have my own.
001:15:49|O|LMP|How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?
001:15:52|O|CDR|Yes, it looks fine to me.
001:15:54|O|LMP|Good.
001:15:57|O|CMP|I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on ...
001:16:07|O|LMP|...
001:16:09|O|CMP|Yes, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?
001:16:14|O|LMP|No, one-handed snap. ... I'm in the center now. ...
001:16:29|O|CMP|Okay, Buzz, the - -
001:16:31|O|LMP|Alright, I'll put yours on the left.
001:16:33|O|CMP|It doesn't matter, I'll - screw it - far as I'm concerned, one's like another.
001:16:37|O|LMP|As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.
001:16:39|O|CMP|Okay.
001:16:40|O|LMP|...
001:16:43|O|CMP|This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can – on this bracket.
001:16:53|O|LMP|Yes.
001:16:53|O|CDR|Okay, that was correct. You - you were asking about that.
001:16:58|O|CMP|And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color; you got 15 minutes worth - 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th.
001:17:18|O|LMP|Okay. The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that?
001:17:28|O|LMP|Outside of it
001:17:32|O|CMP|On the magazine?
001:17:37|O|CMP|Yes.
001:17:42|O|CDR|How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?
001:17:46|O|CMP|No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.
001:17:48|O|LMP|... I don't know - even feel that.
001:17:51|O|CDR|I feel the horizon coming up.
001:17:53|O|CMP|Oh, yes.
001:17:56|O|CDR|Buzz, are you ready to - -
001:17:57|O|CMP|... 90 degrees the wrong way - -
001:17:59|O|CDR|- - are you ready for this briefing? Buzz?
001:18:01|O|LMP|Yes, let me get this.
001:18:02|O|CDR|Oh! Okay.
001:18:05|O|CMP|Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.
001:18:10|O|CDR|Say, we got the rookie with us; he hasn't seen so many of those.
001:18:14|O|CDR|(Laughter) Okay. 30 seconds.
001:18:31|O|CMP|Oh, no, there is a possibility.
001:18:33|O|CDR|We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?
001:18:43|O|LMP|Okay, go ahead and talk.
001:18:44|O|CMP|Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It works like a camera. It has the – The f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom - Your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and you're 12.5 millimeters on the middle one – See, 12.5 millimeters?
001:19:18|O|LMP|Yes.
001:19:19|O|CMP|That's the zoom. Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.
001:19:47|O|LMP|I think that - that's going to do it.
001:19:56|O|CDR|Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.
001:19:58|O|CMP|Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!
001:20:00|O|CDR|Isn't that something?
001:20:01|O|CMP|God damn, that's pretty; it's unreal.
001:20:07|O|CDR|I forgot to get a picture of that.
001:20:11|O|CMP|Ooh, sure, I will. Oh, I've lost the Hasselblad. ... Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far - big son of a gun like that.
001:20:41|O|CDR|Now, what do we have - Is that all the -
001:20:44|O|CMP|You had the switch on inside. Oh ya, okay ... the checklist. This automatic light control features.
001:21:00|O|CMP|Well, that pisses me off. Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the ... Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?
001:21:19|O|LMP|Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it ...?
001:21:23|O|CMP|Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.
001:21:46|O|CMP|I am much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.
001:22:02|O|CDR|And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time until the ...
001:22:14|O|CMP|I've looked - I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.
001:22:22|O|LMP|You can go to your ...
001:22:25|O|CDR|It's too late for sunrise, anyway.
001:22:28|O|CMP|I know, but I'm worried about - -
001:22:29|O|LMP|But you want to get it before TLI.
001:22:31|O|CMP|- - I know it. That's what I'm worried about.
001:22:32|O|LMP|Neil, could you look around over there?
001:22:34|O|CDR|Yes, I'll look.
001:22:36|O|CMP|I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it. Do we have to throw some other switches?
001:22:42|O|LMP|No, the switches are all thrown.
001:22:45|O|CMP|... under you.
001:22:58|O|CMP|Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?
001:23:10|O|CMP|Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody ...?
001:23:17|O|LMP|I've looked already.
001:23:25|O|CMP|Ah! Here it is.
001:23:27|O|CDR|Find it?
001:23:27|O|CMP|Yes.
001:23:28|O|CDR|Beautiful.
001:23:29|O|CMP|It was floating in the aft bulkhead.
001:23:31|O|CDR|On your side?
001:23:35|O|CMP|I got a way on it - of keeping it. ...
001:24:17|O|CMP|I got a little horizon. Man, look at that!
001:24:22|O|LMP|Looks like what you have to do to this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up - -
001:24:27|O|CDR|How's the monitor, working okay for you? Anything I can do to help?

001:25:26|O|LMP|Not yet - flicking an awful lot.
001:25:28|O|CDR|Well, that's ... - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off 22, maybe not – focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.
001:25:45|O|LMP|Sun is bright, isn't it? ... It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth. ...
001:26:01|O|CDR|I think you probably want sort of a wide angle - -

001:27:22|O|CDR|I'm working on the attitude reference check right now.
001:27:30|O|LMP|Now, do we need to do anything else to configure this for ... receiver?

001:27:51|O|CMP|Oh, shoot; they're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI pad, TLI abort, and a P37 pad. They're all right here in this little book; don't forget to remind me of that.
001:28:03|O|CMP|Okay, that's good.
001:28:15|O|LMP|How do you think we can ... handle off?
001:28:17|O|CDR|Yes, you can fold it flat; would that help you?

002:06:47|O|LMP|Yes, they put all this TLI crap in my checklist; even though I took it out, they put it back in.
002:06:53|O|CMP|Well, Mattingly assured me that I was going to have a circular velocity versus altitude, you know, when they get me at 100 miles on the other side?
002:07:01|O|LMP|It's not in here, either, I looked.
002:07:04|O|CMP|Where would it be? It'd be right in here -
002:07:06|O|LMP|I finally gave it to ...
002:07:16|O|CMP|Hey, that's - you know what the numbers are, roughly.
002:07:22|O|CDR|25 - 25 550 at a 100 miles - something like that, it changes, probably - -
002:07:30|O|CMP|Yes, but this was to be - What do you have on this side to give you that on the other side?
002:07:49|O|CMP|I'm running a little bit on the warm side; how are you guys ... along?
002:07:52|O|CDR|Probably a tad on the warm side.
002:07:58|O|CMP|Suit and cabin pressures both look - I guess we should be cool.
002:08:05|O|CDR|Should be about 100 ... - okay -

As expected, this orbit is changing slightly as the S-IVB third stage vents. We are showing an orbit now of 107 by 105.7 nautical miles in an orbital period of 1 hour, 28 minutes, 30 seconds. We've acquired Tananarive now. We'll stand by live through that station.
002:08:45|O|CMP|Gee, I'm really disappointed over those optics; that telescope is horrible. Maybe it'll get better with practice - or adaptation, or what have you.

002:10:39|T|CT|Negative.
002:10:41|T|CT|Roger. Monitor again and I'll tell Capcom to make one more transmission.
002:10:46|O|CDR|Well, they cleverly do this on - just on opposite sides of the world so you always have to pitch - run all the thumbwheels the maximum amount.

The Carnarvon station will acquire at 2 hours, 25 and one-half minutes and during the Carnarvon pass the GO/NO GO decision will be made for the translunar injection maneuver. That maneuver to occur at about 27 minutes from now near the - spacecraft is near the Gilbert Islands, about halfway between Australia and Hawaii.

002:18:55|O|LMP|It didn't seem to me as though there was a tremendous cue; there's no doubt that you were moving, but to say exactly what the precise time was when you started to move, I think you'd call it whenever the thing started vibrating.
002:19:11|O|CMP|Yes, I didn't know when the hell we were airborne; I just took his word for it. It was sure shaking, rattling, and rolling, son of a bitch!

002:21:56|O|CMP|Buzz, I put 39.5 volts over here; that's a reminder on the battery check - real good on the wall. Okay, Neil, now TLI - I'm going to write on the wall here - TLI - nominal is 05 plus 47; and 6 seconds later, it's 05 plus 53.

002:45:55|O|LMP|Why?
002:45:57|O|CMP|These flashes out here - -
002:45:58|O|CDR|Oh, I see a little flashing out there, yes.
002:46:00|P|PAO|Telemetry and radar tracking both solid. Velocity 27,800 feet per second.
002:46:03|O|CMP|You see that? Buzz - did - were you looking? Just watch window 5 for a second. See it?
002:46:09|O|LMP|Yes, yes. Damn, everything's - just kind of sparks flying out there.
002:46:13|O|CMP|Yes, that's - Oopsedo.
002:46:16|O|CDR|Man, that really - -
002:46:17|O|CMP|That's PU shift?
002:46:18|O|CDR|I don't know, but it sure put a little blip in there at 2 minutes; I think it increased in thrust.
002:46:23|O|CMP|Think it's the PU shift?
002:46:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good. Everything's still looking good.
002:46:25|O|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good. Everything's still looking good.
002:46:30|O|CDR|Roger.
002:46:31|T|CDR|Roger.
002:46:31|O|CMP|That's about like a pitch change rather than an acceleration increase. Did it feel that way to you?
002:46:37|O|CMP|Okay. We got a lighted horizon at 2-1/2 minutes. Pretty horizon.
002:46:44|P|PAO|We're 2 and a half minutes into this burn. Still have another 3 minutes to go.
002:46:47|O|LMP|A fairly smooth ride, you know; it's just a little tiny bit rattly, but nothing like Stafford's – H-dot looks great. Don't bet you could do any better.
002:46:57|O|CMP|I'm sure I couldn't. I'd do worse because I'd be a - a full degree off from where it is right now.
002:47:10|P|PAO|And velocity exceeds 29,000 feet per second building up toward 30,000 feet per second.
002:47:13|O|LMP|Don't sweat that. 3 minutes.
002:47:15|O|CMP|3 minutes. What we got, about one g, Neil?
002:47:23|O|LMP|Pressures are good - -
002:47:24|O|CMP|Yes, we've got 3 feet per second - -
002:47:25|O|CDR|Just under one g.
002:47:26|O|LMP|Mike, we're within 3 feet per second on the card H-dot.
002:47:29|P|PAO|Present altitude 115 nautical miles.
002:47:31|O|CMP|Fantastic. And it's shaking everything a little bit.
002:47:34|O|LMP|Shaking at 3 minutes.
002:47:35|O|CDR|Okay.
002:47:36|O|LMP|I hope that camera doesn't fall on your face.
002:47:37|O|CMP|I checked it; it's locked in there pretty well. Won't hurt this visor -
002:47:43|O|CDR|03:30 coming up - Should be 5.5, and it is 5.5.
002:47:52|O|CMP|Nice ride.
002:47:53|O|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Around 3-1/2 minutes. You're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
002:47:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Around 3-1/2 minutes. You're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
002:48:03|O|CDR|Roger. Apollo 11's GO.
002:48:04|T|CDR|Roger. Apollo 11's GO.
002:48:06|O|CMP|I see a bright star out there, must be Venus. Forgot to memorize John Mayer's views out the window well enough to say that's Venus or not, but it's sure bright.
002:48:07|P|PAO|31,200 feet per second now. Altitude 125 nautical miles.
002:48:17|O|LMP|What would you do about it?
002:48:18|O|CMP|Nothing.
002:48:19|O|CDR|4 minutes –
002:48:20|O|CMP|Tell you what - that's Venus.
002:48:21|O|LMP|10 feet per second off on H-dot -
002:48:24|O|CMP|..., that's about where it is.
002:48:26|O|LMP|Here comes the old sun.
002:48:28|O|CMP|Gees, that's going to be bright.
002:48:30|O|CDR|Glad I got my card up.
002:48:31|O|CMP|I'm glad you had - you do too, Neil; that was a good idea, a hell of a good idea. I can't see - well, my tapes are ... I can't ... see very much.
002:48:38|P|PAO|Velocity 32,000 feet per second. Altitude 130 miles.
002:48:41|O|CDR|Coming up on 04:30. How you look, Buzz?
002:48:48|O|LMP|Looks good. Oh, about 14 feet per second right now. The altitude's very good. We ought to get a real good 5-minute cut at the ...
002:49:01|P|PAO|One minute left to burn. Velocity is 33,000 feet per second. Altitude 142 and a half nautical miles
002:49:12|O|CMP|Do you guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes?
002:49:13|O|CDR|Okay.
002:49:14|O|LMP|Just a second.
002:49:15|O|LMP|5 minutes.
002:49:16|O|CMP|MARK.
002:49:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO at 5 minutes.
002:49:17|O|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO at 5 minutes.
002:49:21|O|LMP|Roger. We're GO.
002:49:22|T|LMP|Roger. We're GO.
002:49:23|O|CMP|Okay, we're just a little bit low on time.
002:49:24|O|CMP|Right on it.
002:49:27|O|CDR|... yaw.
002:49:32|P|PAO|34,000 feet per second now. Altitude 152.
002:49:33|O|CMP|... do that?
002:49:34|O|CDR|Yes, we better do that.
002:49:36|O|CMP|5 - 5 seconds –
002:49:39|O|LMP|What kind of g we pulling?
002:49:41|O|CDR|We got a 1.2 or 3 - 1.3, maybe.
002:49:45|O|CMP|Gee, feels a lot more than that already.
002:49:51|O|LMP|Okay, 6 - okay, about 5 seconds to nominal.
002:49:58|P|PAO|35,000 feet per second.
002:50:03|O|CMP|LMP
002:50:05|O|CDR|We have cut-off.
002:50:07|P|PAO|Cut-off. 
002:50:09|O|LMP|3.3 on the DELTA - -
002:50:11|O|CDR|The DELTA-VC on the EMS: 3.3.
002:50:13|O|CMP|Beautiful. EMS FUNCTION, OFF.
002:50:13|P|PAO|We're showing velocity 35,570 feet per second. Altitude 177 nautical miles.
002:50:17|O|CDR|OFF.
002:50:18|O|CMP|SECS PYRO ARM, two, SAFE.
002:50:22|O|CMP|I got out - I got out of kilter here; let's go back and let Buzz pick up on it. You're just a little bit ahead of yourself on the checklist.
002:50:28|O|CDR|Okay.
002:50:29|O|CDR|Okay, Houston, you read 11?
002:50:34|O|CMP|Buzz, forget I read anything in the checklist.
002:50:36|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We show cut-off and we copy the numbers in NOUN 62.
002:50:38|O|LMP|Yes - -
002:50:39|O|CDR|Not getting any answer -
002:50:41|O|CMP|Okay, let's go to IU ACCEPT here. Now, ...
002:50:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read?
002:50:55|O|CMP|Why don't you try to get up high - -
002:50:57|O|CDR|SCS TVC SERVO POWER 1, OFF.
002:50:59|O|LMP|Okay.
002:51:00|O|CDR|You want to get Houston on the radio if you can?
002:51:01|O|LMP|Yes.
002:51:02|O|CDR|PCM BIT RATE, LOW.
002:51:03|O|CMP|PCM BIT RATE is LOW - -
002:51:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
002:51:20|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. We're reading a VI of 35579 and the EMS was plus 3.3. Over.
002:51:30|T|CC|Roger. Plus 3.3 on the EMS. And we copy the VI.
002:53:02|T|CDR|Hey, Houston, Apollo 11. That Saturn gave us a magnificent ride.
002:53:08|T|CC|Roger, 11. We'll pass that on. And, it certainly looks like you are well on your way now.
002:53:18|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong praising the launch vehicle.
002:53:29|T|CDR|We got - we have no complaints with any of the three stages on that ride. It was beautiful.
002:53:37|T|CC|Roger. We copy. No transients at staging of any significance? Over.
002:53:43|T|CDR|That's right. It was all - all a good ride.
002:53:46|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
002:54:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information, we expect the maneuver to separation attitude to begin at 3 plus 05 plus 03, and to be completed at plus 09 plus 20. Separation at 3 plus 15 plus 00.
002:54:32|T|LMP|Roger. Time to begin maneuver is 3:05:03, complete 3:09:20. Separation 3 plus 15:00.
002:54:45|T|CC|Roger. That separation should be 3 plus 15:03. My error in reading up.
002:54:54|T|LMP|Roger.
002:55:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, the velocity falling off now. Immediately after shutdown we're showing 34,000 feet per second now. The altitude building 512 nautical miles.
002:55:18|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. All the booster functions are proceeding normally. The sequencing is in good shape, and it doesn't look like they are having any problems at all. Over.
002:55:27|T|CDR|Roger.
002:55:51|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control and we're showing orbital weight 138,892.9 pounds.
003:00:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours into the mission. Velocity now 31,214 feet per second. Apollo 11's distance from Earth, 1,245 nautical miles.
003:05:27|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Our preliminary data indicates a good cut-off on the S-IVB. We'll have some more trajectory data for you in about half an hour. Over.
003:06:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The S-IVB has started its maneuvering to the separation attitude.
003:07:10|P|PAO|At 3 hours 7 minutes the velocity is 27,945 feet per second. Distance from Earth 2,384 nautical miles.
003:09:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
003:09:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
003:09:31|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 11. I'm reading you loud and clear. Go ahead. Over.
003:09:36|T|CC|Roger, 11. This is Houston. We had to shift stations. We weren't reading you through Goldstone. We show PYRO bus A armed and PYRO bus B not armed at the present time. Over.
003:09:50|T|CMP|That's affirmative, Houston. That's affirmative.
003:09:53|T|CC|Roger.
003:10:09|P|PAO|The S-IVB has completed its maneuver to separation attitude.
003:11:01|P|PAO|4 minutes away from separation, 4 minutes.
003:11:26|P|PAO|At 3 hours 11 minutes into the mission velocity 26,314 feet per second. Distance from Earth 3,140 nautical miles.
003:12:45|P|PAO|The S-IVB is reported in a stable attitude for the separation.
003:13:07|P|PAO|Rates are less than 1/10th of a foot per second in all axis.
003:14:04|P|PAO|One minute to separation.
003:14:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. You're GO for separation. Our systems recommendation is arm both PYRO buses. Over.
003:14:19|T|CMP|Okay. PYRO B coming armed. My intent is to use bottle primary 1, as per the checklist; therefore, I just turned A on.
003:14:26|T|CC|Roger. We concur with the logic.
003:16:11|PAO|We're waiting confirmation of separation.
003:16:29|O|LMP|- - two, ARMED.
003:16:29|O|CMP|Two, ARMED.
003:16:30|O|LMP|CMC MODE, AUTO.
003:16:31|O|CMP|AUTO.
003:16:32|O|LMP|Start the digital event timer.
003:16:33|O|CMP|Okay, start.
003:16:36|O|LMP|And we're going to translate plus X and hold.
003:16:37|O|CMP|Yes.
003:16:38|O|LMP|CM/LAUNCH VEHICLE SEP pushbutton?
003:16:40|O|CMP|Yes.
003:16:41|O|LMP|Watch the tank pressure and the engine light.
003:16:43|O|CMP|Are you on tank pressures? You are.
003:16:48|O|LMP|And you're going to go to 100.8?
003:16:50|O|CMP|Yes.
003:16:58|O|LMP|You want to -
003:17:00|O|CMP|Here we go.
003:17:00|O|CDR|Okay, Houston; we're about to SEP.
003:17:00|T|CDR|Houston, we're about to SEP.
003:17:02|O|CC|This is Houston. We copy.
003:17:02|T|CC|This is Houston. We copy.
003:17:02|O|CMP|Thrusting -
003:17:05|O|CDR|SEP.
003:17:06|O|LMP|Look at that trash. Jesus.
003:17:10|O|CDR|SEP complete.
003:17:10|T|CDR|SEP complete.
003:17:12|T|CC|Roger.
003:17:12|O|LMP|Got DELTA-V?
003:17:13|O|CMP|Okay, got 0.7; I'm going to stop there and - -
003:17:16|O|LMP|... go to RELEASE; DELTA-V indicator minus 100.8 - -
003:17:17|PAO|We confirm the separation here on the ground.
003:17:20|O|CMP|Okay.
003:17:21|O|LMP|- - SERVICE MODULE RCS PROPELLANT, verify eight of them gray.
003:17:23|O|CMP|Okay, you got problems there. Get the ... – there you go.
003:17:27|O|CDR|I'll get them.
003:17:28|O|LMP|Okay, okay.
003:17:31|O|CMP|What else? Did - -
003:17:33|O|LMP|CM - -
003:17:34|O|CDR|PRIMARY and SECONDARY PROPELLANT B went barber pole at SEP.
003:17:34|T|CDR|... and primary and secondary propellant B went ... SEP.
003:17:41|O|CC|That was SECONDARY PROPELLANT on quad Bravo?
003:17:41|T|CC|That was secondary propellant on quad Bravo?
003:17:46|O|CDR|Quad Bravo, yes. Both the PRIMARY and SECONDARY talkbacks went barber pole.
003:17:46|T|CDR|Quad Bravo, yes. Both the primary and secondary ...
003:17:51|O|CMP|..., three, OPEN.
003:17:52|O|LMP|Okay, your - -
003:17:52|O|CC|Roger; we copy.
003:17:52|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
003:17:55|O|LMP|- - ... This is the one that ... 0.5, right? Is it - Mike, you key a VERB 62?
003:17:03|O|CMP|Yes.
003:17:03|O|LMP|PROCEED and you're pitching?
003:18:05|O|CDR|She's pitching.
003:18:06|O|CMP|Trying - to turn itself off again; look at this.
003:18:10|O|CDR|Is it holding it this time?
003:18:12|O|CMP|Watch, it'll probably go back to RATE COMMAND.
003:18:15|O|CDR|That slows it down?
003:18:17|O|CMP|... keeps pitching.
003:18:20|O|LMP|Your MAN ATT, PITCH, to ACCEL COMMAND?
003:18:24|O|CDR|It went to RATE - Okay, I see a SLA panel going out.
003:18:28|O|LMP|Okay, you got to get a pitch rate in there -
003:18:35|O|CDR|See that SLA panel?
003:18:39|O|LMP|Is it flying - yet?
003:18:43|O|CMP|It's alright. She's darn well unbelievable - something.
003:18:52|O|CDR|I see it ...
003:18:56|O|LMP|Do I need some circuit breaker in to get - -
003:18:57|O|CDR|I see another - No, that's alright.
003:18:59|O|LMP|- - to get this camera going? Mike?
003:19:02|O|CMP|No, you need the power on over there, though.
003:19:04|O|LMP|I turned it on.
003:19:05|O|CDR|I got it. ... beautiful.
003:19:06|O|CMP|You sure you have the right power switch on?
003:19:09|O|CDR|Boy, that's - -
003:19:10|O|LMP|Yes.
003:19:10|O|CMP|You got him?
003:19:11|O|CDR|Yes, Mike.
003:19:12|O|LMP|No, I don't.
003:19:12|O|CMP|To the right over here.
003:19:13|O|CDR|Can you see him?
003:19:14|O|LMP|No, I don't see - -
003:19:15|O|CDR|He's a little bit to our right.
003:19:16|O|LMP|Okay, I see him.
003:19:18|O|CDR|We need about a 5-degree right, and we need to stop our - -
003:19:21|O|CMP|Okay. We'll stop here.
003:19:23|O|CDR|- - ... and we're pretty far away from him, too.
003:19:30|O|CMP|Okay, watch it, we should be stopping here.
003:19:44|O|LMP|How long do we want to run this film?
003:19:51|O|CDR|How does he look, Mike?
003:19:52|O|CMP|He's - he's fine.
003:19:58|O|CDR|Okay, you got 100.4 now.
003:19:59|O|CMP|Yes, I know; those numbers don't mean anything. They were 99-something when we turned around; don't ask me why. I thrusted toward him quite a bit, and I don't know why those numbers were screwed up, but they were.
003:20:18|O|CDR|Buzz, how does he look to you; looks like he's getting closer to me.
003:20:20|O|CMP|... get the BMAG?
003:20:22|O|LMP|Okay.
003:20:23|O|CDR|Yes, it looks like he's drifting down just a tad, and he's supposed to be.
003:20:31|O|CMP|How are our eight gray talkbacks; they still good?
003:20:32|O|CDR|Very good.
003:20:48|O|CMP|Flies like a spacecraft instead of a simulator. Hope that's good.
003:20:57|O|CMP|Sure beautiful. I hope you got some pictures, Buzz.
003:21:00|O|LMP|I got the 16 millimeter going - -
003:21:01|O|CDR|Is it going?
003:21:02|O|LMP|- - 16 frames at f:8 - -
003:21:03|O|CDR|Good.
003:21:05|O|LMP|- - 70, 1/250th, ...
003:21:08|O|CDR|Beautiful.
003:21:10|O|LMP|It really looks nice, doesn't it?
003:21:11|O|CMP|Hey, we're closing in a leisurely fashion.
003:21:17|O|LMP|Hey, how long does this ...?
003:21:21|O|CMP|It's on the - it's printed - -
003:21:22|O|CDR|Yes.
003:21:23|O|CMP|- - yes, it's six frames at 15; I suggest toward the end you probably goose it up a little bit.
003:21:28|O|LMP|You want to get the whole thing?
003:21:29|O|CDR|I don't care - ... tell by looking at ...
003:21:37|O|CDR|The thing is, with this sitting there, I can't get much with the Hasselblad. That window's no good, I'm afraid.
003:21:51|O|CDR|Can I hold something for you?
003:21:53|O|LMP|Take a couple of ...
003:21:59|O|CMP|Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.
003:22:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
003:22:09|O|CDR|I'll do it.
003:22:10|O|LMP|...
003:22:22|O|CDR|Be sure that your RCS is working anyway.
003:22:28|O|LMP|How far out are you, Mike?
003:22:30|O|CMP|I'm still quite a ways. That's definitely a SLA panel - there's no doubt about that. Sure looks like ... panel. That stuff's hitting from the S-IVB from us. Gees, look it - that one thing just hit the - gyro package on the S-band antenna.
003:22:30|P|PAO|The Goldstone station reports a very weak signal. We believe that Mike Collins is now maneuvering the spacecraft in the transposition and docking maneuver, and the antenna patterns aren't too good at the moment, so we have a weak signal strength.
003:22:51|O|LMP|Yes, things occasionally come scooting out.
003:22:57|O|CMP|...
003:22:58|O|LMP|And, occasionally, you know, a little piece of something hits the - what do you call that - covering? The whole LM quivers every so often. All - all the surface of it, Neil, you know, just kind of shakes like that.
003:23:16|O|CDR|Yes?
003:23:17|O|LMP|Just in one spot; it's not being hit. I hope it doesn't come in ... - -
003:23:22|O|CMP|Stand by; we're getting pretty close.
003:23:23|O|CDR|Just from the APS firing, you think?
003:23:29|O|CMP|Stand by; we're closing.
003:23:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. Request OMNI Bravo if you read us. Request OMNI Bravo. Out.
003:24:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read?
003:24:40|O|LMP|Okay - -
003:24:42|O|CDR|We don't have too much - -
003:24:43|O|LMP|- - BMAG MODE, three - You should stabilize and align CM - BMAG MODE, three, to ATT 1/RATE 2?
003:24:49|O|CMP|Okay.
003:24:50|O|LMP|And we're - translated plus X. That CAPTURE PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, you've done that; CMC MODE, FREE?
003:24:56|O|CDR|Yes, sir.
003:24:57|O|CMP|Yes.
003:24:57|O|LMP|Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?
003:25:00|O|CDR|We did that.
003:25:00|O|LMP|Yes, you've done that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, PRIMARY 1?
003:25:03|O|CMP|We did that.
003:25:03|O|LMP|Alright, after dock - -
003:25:20|O|LMP|- - EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF?
003:25:43|P|PAO|Goldstone still showing weak signal strength.
003:25:21|O|CDR|DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF, I did that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, ... to OFF.
003:25:27|O|LMP|Okay, DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, two of them, OFF?
003:25:30|O|CDR|No, no, wait a minute. It says "DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF," huh?
003:25:34|O|LMP|Yes.
003:25:35|O|CDR|Okay.
003:25:36|O|LMP|Alright, let's go. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, two of them, OFF?
003:25:38|O|CDR|CMP
003:25:40|O|LMP|Alright. Circuit breakers: DOCKING PROBE, two, OPEN.
003:25:45|O|CDR|DOCKING PROBE, two, OPEN.
003:25:47|O|LMP|Okay, PCM BIT RATE is LOW. Postdocking: it says RATE, HIGH; ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
003:25:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
003:25:56|O|CMP|RATE, HIGH; ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
003:25:58|O|LMP|COAS POWER, OFF.
003:25:59|O|CMP|COAS POWER, OFF.
003:26:01|O|CDR|... get this to stop ...
003:26:05|O|CMP|Yes, that wasn't the smoothest docking I've ever done.
003:26:05|O|CDR|Well, it felt good from here.
003:26:08|O|CMP|I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know? I thought I could about equal the simulator in ... and I didn't - I bet you I used - I hate to quote a number, but I've been down around 30-some pounds in the simulator, and I'll bet this was 50, 60 pounds, something like that. Hate to quote a number.
003:26:31|O|CMP|How do the - Speaking of that, how do the Service Module RCS quantities look?
003:26:35|O|CDR|Well, Buzz is fooling around with that - Let me just - -
003:26:37|O|LMP|They - they're all 90 except B, which is above 90.
003:26:42|O|CDR|Should be. Can't ever tell on 3 -
003:26:45|O|LMP|No, C and D are ... 3, anyway.
003:26:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
003:26:52|O|CDR|Okay -
003:26:55|O|CMP|Well, I got to go in there and dick - -
003:26:57|O|LMP|I'm not sure that we're getting - -
003:27:00|O|CDR|Well, Buzz is getting COMM right now.
003:27:01|O|CMP|Yes, let Buzz do his high-gain thing, and I'll get ready to go dick with the tunnel.
003:27:17|O|LMP|Sure is squiggly, isn't it? It really wanders all over, doesn't it?
003:27:32|O|CMP|Neil, where do you put this guy - usually?
003:27:34|O|CDR|I - clip it to that - clip up there beside the COAS - you see - -
003:27:38|O|CMP|Okay.
003:27:39|O|CDR|- - see those clips up there, one of those. It's got a snap right here that's pretty good.
003:27:48|O|CMP|I think I can get it now - ...
003:27:54|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
003:28:09|O|CMP|Okay, Buzz, how am I doing on the checklist?
003:28:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
003:28:18|O|LMP|Well, I'm trying to - -
003:28:19|O|CDR|You're at the high-gain - -
003:28:20|O|LMP|- - you're at postdocking; I'm trying to get the high-gain going - and I'm having a little trouble - ... trouble.
003:28:28|O|CDR|That's MANUAL -
003:28:32|O|CMP|Whatever you do, take some pictures.
003:28:35|O|CDR|That should be on wide beam or ...?
003:28:37|O|LMP|Wide.
003:28:40|O|CDR|Okay.
003:28:42|O|LMP|Hey, if you're through there, give me that VERB 64.
003:28:45|O|CMP|What? Okay.
003:28:47|O|CDR|I'm amazed how it just wanders around for a given setting; you notice that?
003:28:54|O|CMP|There - it sounds like we got it now. There's your VERB 64.
003:28:57|O|CDR|We got signal strength.
003:28:59|O|CMP|Okay. You have to really be on MANUAL for those things to be indicating correctly.
003:29:05|O|CDR|He was but - -
003:29:06|O|CMP|Okay.
003:29:07|O|CDR|- - this one was just kind of wandering around there - with no - -
003:29:12|O|LMP|As soon as I went down to high-gain was when the signal strength came up.
003:29:16|O|CMP|Okay, ... man.
003:29:20|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
003:29:20|O|CC|Apollo 11 - -
003:29:24|T|CDR|Roger. Loud and clear.
003:29:26|T|CC|Roger. We're copying you about five-by-two, very weak. Can you give us a status report, please?
003:29:34|T|CDR|Roger. We are docked. We do have acquisition with the high-gain at this time, I think.
003:29:44|T|CC|Understand you are using the high-gain. Over.
003:29:48|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
003:29:49|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
003:29:50|T|CC|Roger. I read - I read you very loud and clear, Buzz. Mike's pretty weak.
003:30:00|T|LMP|Roger. We've got the high-gain locked on, now, I believe; AUTO tracking now.
003:30:05|T|CC|Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, but Mike is just barely readable.
003:30:12|T|CMP|That was Neil. How are you reading Mike?
003:30:14|T|CC|Loud and clear now, Mike, and we understand that you are docked.
003:30:18|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
003:30:23|T|CDR|Houston, CDR. How do you read ...?
003:30:28|T|CC|11, CDR, loud and clear, Neil.
003:30:30|T|CDR|Okay.
003:31:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11's velocity now 21,096 feet per second, distance from Earth 6,649 nautical miles.
003:32:39|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
003:32:43|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
003:32:46|T|CC|Roger. When you commented on that quad Bravo problem at separation, you were a little weak. Could you go through what you did after you noticed the talkbacks barber pole again, please?
003:33:19|T|CC|We copied the - the primary and secondary propellant talkbacks on SM RCS quad Bravo 1 to barber pole on separation.
003:33:30|T|LMP|Roger. Roger. That is affirmative, and we moved that switch to the OPEN position, and they went back to gray. Over.
003:33:39|T|CC|Roger.
003:35:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're 34 minutes away from extraction of the Lunar Module from its adapter in the third stage of the Saturn.
003:36:22|P|PAO|The crew has started pressurizing the LM.
003:37:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
003:37:55|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Go ahead.
003:37:57|T|CC|Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.
003:38:06|T|CMP|I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACCEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S-IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.
003:38:52|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. We copy.
003:38:59|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins giving the description on the transposition and docking. 
003:43:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
003:43:47|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
003:43:49|T|CMP|Roger. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.
003:44:16|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a second.
003:44:55|T|CMP|And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading in there now, Neil?
003:45:17|T|CMP|We have about 450 psi now in the three 1-pound bottles.
003:45:23|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a second, please.
003:45:25|T|CMP|Roger. Standing by. And, the REPRESS package valve is now in the OFF position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure is now 4.5.
003:46:25|P|PAO|At 3 hours, 46 minutes, velocity is 18,917 feet per second. Distance from Earth 9,002 nautical miles.
003:47:49|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down any further with these decals.
003:48:00|T|CT|Okay, Capcom.
003:48:28|T|LMP|And, Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read?
003:48:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
003:48:35|T|LMP|Roger. LM looks to be in pretty fine shape from about all we can see from here.
003:48:43|T|CC|Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?
003:49:07|T|CMP|Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.
003:49:11|T|CC|Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the Command Module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.
003:49:20|T|CMP|Yes. We think it's within normal tolerances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.
003:49:32|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
003:49:37|T|CMP|Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.
003:49:39|T|CC|And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the Service Module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.
003:50:11|T|CMP|Okay. Good idea. That's being done.
003:50:13|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
003:50:29|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're doing a non-propulsive vent on the booster at the present time. You may see some sort of a cloud coming out of it. And, when you're ready, I have your evasive maneuver PAD.
003:50:44|T|LMP|Roger, And it's coming out.
003:50:48|T|CC|Roger. Out,
003:50:49|T|LMP|It's a haze. It's going by toward our minus-X direction, and several small particles are moving along with it. The actual velocity is fairly high - at least it appears to be high. And we've got an O2 high - it's a little high right now.
003:51:14|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
003:53:05|T|CDR|And, Houston, you, might be interested that out my left-hand window right now, I can observe the entire continent of North America, Alaska, over the Pole, down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, northern part of South America, and then I run out of window.
003:53:27|T|CC|Roger, We copy.
003:53:31|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong with that report.
003:57:12|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. All 12 latches are locked.
003:57:16|T|CC|Roger. 11, this is Houston. Understand 12 latches locked.
003:57:30|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin reporting that all 12 of the latches in the docking mechanism had locked.
003:59:03|T|CC|11, Houston. Whenever you're possessed of a free moment there, we've got this evasive maneuver PAD.
003:59:12|T|LMP|Okay.
003:59:20|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11 is ready to copy.
003:59:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Evasive maneuver SPS G&N: 63481, plus 095, minus 020; GETI 004 40 0100, plus 00051, plus all balls, plus 00190; roll is your option, pitch 213 357; NOUN 44 is NA; DELTA-VT, 00197 003 00152. The rest of the PAD is NA. No ullage. LM weight 33,290. Read back. Over.
004:01:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Standing by for your readback. Over.
004:02:05|T|CC|11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
004:02:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
004:02:31|T|LMP|All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off. Your transmissions were cut off very abruptly. How do you read now?
004:02:43|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear. We had a handover to Madrid about the time I was - I guess halfway through the PAD. If you could give me the last value you read, I'll pick up there. Over.
004:02:53|T|LMP|Okay. Start with DELTA-VZ. Over.
004:02:56|T|CC|Roger. DELTA-VZ is plus 00190, roll your option, pitch 213 357, and NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VT 00197 003 00152. The rest of the PAD is NA, and no ullage. LM weight 33,290. Read back. Over.
004:03:41|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Evasive maneuver SPS G&N: 63481, plus 095, minus 020 004 40 0100, plus 00051, plus all zeros, plus 00190, roll crew option, 213 357, NA, 00197 003 00152, no ullage, LM weight 33,290. Over.
004:04:28|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
004:04:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 4 minutes Apollo 11's velocity now is 17,014 feet per second. Its distance from Earth, 11,753 nautical miles. We're about 5 minutes away from ejection of the Lunar Module and about 35 minutes away from this evasive maneuver. Ignition time on the evasive maneuver Ground Elapsed Time of 4 hours 40 minutes 1 second. It will be a service propulsion system burn of 3 seconds duration DELTA-V 19.7 feet per second.
004:13:33|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
004:13:35|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
004:13:37|T|CMP|We'd like to arm our logic switches.
004:13:42|T|CC|Go ahead with the logic.
004:13:44|T|CMP|Okay. Mark logic 1 and 2 armed.
004:13:58|T|CC|Roger. We show the logic arm, and you're GO for PYRO arm.
004:16:38|T|CDR|Houston, we're ready for LM ejection.
004:16:45|T|CC|Roger. You're GO for LM ejection.
004:16:48|T|CDR|Thank you.
004:17:13|T|CDR|Houston, we are SEP. We have a CRYO PRESS light.
004:17:17|T|CC|Roger. Copy. CRYO PRESS light.
004:17:46|T|CC|Roger, 11. We recommend you turn the O2 fans on manually and ensure that the O2 heaters are in the AUTOMATIC position.
004:17:57|T|CDR|Roger. O2 heaters are ON, and we're going to cycle the O2 fans now.
004:18:01|T|CC|Roger. O2 heaters to AUTO, or you can watch them in the ON position, and O2 fans manual ON.
004:28:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, this ls Houston. Over.
004:28:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
004:28:22|T|CC|Roger. In reference to your question on RCS usage: it looks like you are about 18, maybe 20 pounds below nominal at the present time. No problem at all. Over.
004:28:34|T|CMP|Right.
004:28:45|T|CMP|I wanted to be 18 or 20 pounds above nominal, babe.
004:28:48|T|CC|Sorry about that.
004:34:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours, 34 minutes. Apollo 11's velocity is 14,972 feet per second. Its distance from Earth is 15,895 nautical miles. The spacecraft weight 96,760.9 pounds. We're about 5 minutes away from the evasive maneuver that will ensure there will be no problems of recontact between the spacecraft and the S-IVB stage of the launch vehicle.
004:37:40|T|CC|11, Houston. Your systems are looking good. We're standing by for the burn.
004:39:28|P|PAO|The duration of this burn will be 3 seconds. DELTA-V 19.7 feet per second.
004:40:09|P|PAO|Ignition, shutdown.
004:40:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you confirm that pitch gimbal motor number 1 turned off? We just shut all four off, and we got a questionable indication on the ECS on pitch 1.
004:41:01|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a second.
004:41:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by, please.
004:41:32|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston. Did you copy our residuals?
004:41:37|T|CC|Roger. We got 00 and 0.2, it looks like.
004:41:41|T|CMP|We had 0.1 while ago. It's - just went to 0.2.
004:41:45|T|CC|Okay.
004:41:47|T|CDR|That EMS DELTA-V counter is minus 4.0.
004:41:50|T|CC|Minus 4.0. Roger.
004:41:53|T|CDR|And how about pitch gimbal 1? Can you confirm that OFF?
004:41:56|T|CC|Can you stand by just a second on that? At the present time we cannot confirm it OFF. We saw a current drop indicating that several gimbal motors had gone off. We'll be back with you in just a second on it. Over.
004:42:10|T|CDR|Okay, If necessary, we can recycle it.
004:43:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you'll go ahead and cycle pitch gimbal motor number 1 on and then off and give us a Mark, and we'll tell you what we see. Over.
004:43:58|T|CDR|Okay, fine. It's coming back on. Ready.
004:44:00|T|CDR|MARK.
004:44:04|T|CDR|And it's going back off. Ready.
004:44:06|T|CDR|MARK.
004:44:07|T|CDR|And that time we got an onboard indication, Houston. Thank you a lot.
004:44:12|T|CC|Roger. We confirm that it is OFF.
004:44:15|T|CDR|Yes. We do likewise.
004:44:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours, 44 minutes. A news conference at Kennedy Space Center is about to begin. We will take down the live circuits and tape air to ground during this news conference and play it back after the conference. This is Mission Control, Houston.
004:45:34|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to observe the S-IVB slingshot.
004:45:39|T|CC|Roger, 11. We've got an updated attitude for you on the slingshot observation.
004:45:45|T|CMP|Okay. Say the angles please.
004:45:47|T|CC|Roger. Roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, yaw 357.5, and there's also an update - minor correction to your attitude for the P52. Over.
004:46:15|T|CMP|Roger. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Over.
004:46:23|T|CC|Roger. And for your P52 and optics calibration, it'll be roll 346.5, pitch 345.0, and yaw 007.8. Over.
004:46:44|T|CMP|Roger. 346.5, 345.0, and 007.8. Thank you.
004:46:49|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
004:49:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
004:49:35|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
004:49:38|T|CC|Roger. We're going to go ahead and enable the S-IVB for the slingshot maneuver. The LOX dump will start about 12 minutes from now. Over.
004:49:49|T|CMP|Okay, LOX dump about - I guess that'll make it about 01, huh?
004:49:56|T|CC|Right. I'll try to give you a little closer update as we approach it.
004:50:00|T|CMP|Alrighty.
004:50:53|T|CC|And, 11, for you information, the magnitude of mid-course correction number 1, if we burned, looks like about 17 feet per second. We're presently considering not burning it. This would make mid-course correction 2 tomorrow about 21.3. Over.
004:51:18|T|CDR|That sounds good to us.
004:51:19|T|CC|Roger. You're looking good down here.
004:52:19|T|CDR|Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, North Atlantic, and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabasca - probably east of Athabasca area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.
004:53:24|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
004:53:28|T|CMP|I didn't know what I was looking at, but I sure did like it.
004:53:31|T|CC|Okay (laughter). I guess the view must be pretty good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now.
004:53:42|T|CMP|I didn't have much outside my window.
004:53:48|T|CC|We'll get you into the PTC one of these days, and you take turns looking.
004:57:32|T|CC|...
004:57:34|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're - we've completed our maneuver to, observe the slingshot attitude, but we don't see anything - no Earth and no S-IVB.
004:57:48|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. In GET I have a LOX dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07, and stop at 5 plus 04 plus 55. Ullage burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 27. Over.
004:58:26|T|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
005:00:47|T|CC|11, Houston.
005:00:51|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
005:00:52|T|CC|Roger. We now recommend the following attitude: roll 307.0, pitch 354.0, yaw 019.5, and the LOX dump has already been enabled, so we can't hold it off any longer.
005:01:15|T|CMP|That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver around to 307, 354, and 19 and a half. Thank you sir.
005:01:20|T|CC|Roger.
005:01:41|T|CC|11, Houston. It doesn't look to us like you'll be able to make it around to this observation attitude in 2 minutes. We recommend that you save the fuel. Over.
005:01:54|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've - you got to us just a little late. Our maneuver's already begun, so it's going to cost us about the same amount of fuel to stop it, no matter where we stop it, and we may as well keep going.
005:02:04|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
005:03:19|T|CC|11, Houston. LOX dump initiated.
005:05:06|T|CC|11, Houston. LOX dump has been terminated. Over.
005:05:09|T|CMP|Roger.
005:05:12|T|LMP|Roger. We still don't have him in sight.
005:05:16|T|CC|Roger. Out.
005:11:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 11 minutes into the mission. The S-IVB slingshot maneuver was completed about 5 minutes ago. Designed to put the third stage of the launch vehicle into a trajectory that will take it behind the trailing edge of the Moon and then into a solar orbit. The crew did not witness this maneuver. The Command Module was not in the proper attitude where they could see the S-IVB at the time. We've advised the crew that we do not believe that we'll do the first mid-course correction. That we'll wait for mid-course correction 2 tomorrow and expect a DELTA V to be performed in that maneuver of about 21.3 feet per second. We've also had some other brief transmissions including a - comments from Neil Armstrong on the view out the window, and a weather report on the part of the world he can see. We have the tape of these transmissions that have occurred during the news conference at the Cape. We'll play that for you now and catch up live.
005:12:58|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
005:13:03|T|CMP|Go ahead.
005:13:05|T|CC|Roger. If you'll give us ACCEPT and stay in P00, we'll set your trunnion bias to zero. And, I have a plan for balancing your oxygen CRYO's. Over.
005:13:19|T|CMP|You got it.
005:13:21|T|CC|Roger.
005:13:26|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the - what appears to be the S IVB in sight - at - oh, I'd estimate a couple of miles away. It's at our number 5 window and the dump appears to be coming out of two radially opposite directions from the S-IVB.
005:13:52|T|CC|Roger. They're continuing with the non-propulsion vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite, there. And booster tells me it's the continuous vent system. They're also dumping a small amount of fuel at this time. We've got about 23-1/2 minutes or so until the APS burn. Over.
005:14:25|T|LMP|Roger.
005:14:46|T|CC|11, Houston. We have a recommended configuration for your CRYO switches to even up the load between oxygen tanks 1 and 2. Over.
005:14:55|T|SC|...
005:14:59|T|CC|Okay. You're coming in very weakly there. We're recommending O2 tank 1 heater OFF, O2 tank 2 heater to AUTO, O2 tanks 1 and 2 fans both OFF, H1 - H2 tank 1 heaters to AUTO, and H2 tank 2 heaters to OFF. Over.
005:15:33|T|LMP|Roger. We have that except the last one was H2 fans to OFF. Is that affirmative?
005:15:49|T|CDR|We have - The configuration we have now is - Hydrogen heaters: we got 1 AUTO, 2 OFF. Oxygen heaters: 1 OFF, 2 AUTO. And we have all the fans OFF.
005:16:02|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. We concur. Out.
005:16:12|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We've completed the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to BLOCK.
005:16:23|T|CDR|Roger that. Thank you.
005:19:21|T|CC|11, this is Houston. With this maneuvering to observe the slingshot, I guess we missed copying your LM/CM DELTA-P readings. Over.
005:19:33|T|CMP|Stand by. We'll give you a recent one.
005:19:34|T|CC|Roger.
005:19:47|T|CMP|Right now, reading 0.2, Bruce.
005:19:49|T|CC|Roger. 0.2.
005:20:00|T|CC|Okay, Mike. And could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in VENT, there?
005:20:12|T|CMP|Roger. Waste compartment valve has been in VENT for - oh, I guess, 45 minutes or so.
005:20:17|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
005:20:31|T|CMP|If we're late in answering you, it's because we're munching sandwiches.
005:20:36|T|CC|Roger. I wish I could do the same here.
005:20:39|T|CMP|No. Don't leave the console!
005:20:42|T|CC|Don't worry. I won't.
005:20:47|T|CMP|FLIGHT doesn't like it.
005:20:54|T|CMP|How is FLIGHT today?
005:20:58|T|CC|Oh, he's doing quite well.
005:22:56|PAO|This is Apollo control at 5 hours 22 minutes. We're back live now. The Delta-P you heard discussed is the difference in pressure between the LM and the Command Module cabin pressure. Apollo 11 coming up on 22,000 miles distance from the Earth now. Velocity 12,914 feet per second.
005:23:41|T|CDR|Houston, 11.
005:23:43|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
005:23:47|T|CDR|Down in the Control Center you might want to join us in wishing Dr. George Mueller a happy birthday.
005:23:55|T|CC|Roger. We are standing by for your birthday greetings.
005:24:06|T|CDR|I think today is also the birthday of California, and I believe they are 200 years old, and we send them a happy birthday. And I think it's Dr. Mueller's birthday, also, and I don't think he is that old.
005:24:25|T|CC|Roger. We copy. I'm looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him back there.
005:24:33|T|CDR|He may not be back from the Cape yet.
005:24:43|T|CC|Roger. I believe Dr. Mueller is on his way back from the Cape. We will relay his greetings for you.
005:24:50|T|CDR|Thank you.
005:28:18|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
005:28:22|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
005:28:24|T|CC|Roger. At your convenience, we'd like to get a wastewater dump to 25 percent remaining. After completion of this one, the next wastewater dump will be at about GET equal to 25 hours. Over.
005:28:42|T|CDR|Coming on right now.
005:28:44|T|CC|Roger.
005:31:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 31 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11's velocity now is 12,637 feet per second. Distance from Earth 22,971 miles. Spacecraft weight is 96,573 pounds.
005:35:27|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Did you copy our torquing angles?
005:35:31|T|CC|Roger. Leave them on there probably a second, please.
005:35:34|T|CMP|Will do.
005:36:22|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We copy the angles, but stand by before you go ahead and use them. Over.
005:36:29|T|CMP|Standing by.
005:36:32|T|CC|11, Houston. We request that you redo P52, and if the angles come out the same magnitude, go ahead and incorporate them. Over.
005:36:42|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do that.
005:36:44|T|CC|They look a little large right now.
005:36:46|T|CMP|Yes. Roll - roll looks a little large, especially, there.
005:36:50|T|CC|Roger.
005:37:31|T|CC|We're showing a wastewater quantity of about 13 percent on TM now, 11. Over.
005:37:43|T|CMP|Roger. It's off, now
005:37:44|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
005:39:32|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Torquing angles essentially the same, and we're going to go ahead and torque them now.
005:39:40|T|CC|Roger. We concur.
005:39:43|T|CMP|Okay.
005:41:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an AUTO optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?
005:41:46|T|CMP|Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.
005:41:51|T|CC|I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.
005:42:03|T|CMP|Okay.
005:43:25|T|CC|11, Houston. I have a TLI-plus-11-hour PAD when you're ready to copy.
005:43:33|T|LMP|Wait one.
005:44:17|T|CMP|Old star number 30 looks like it is right dab smack in the middle of the sextant.
005:44:23|T|CMP|Houston. Roger. Out.
005:45:27|T|LMP|Apollo 11, ready to copy.
005:45:31|T|CC|Roger, 11 This is TLI-plus-11-hours. P37 format: 01344 4793, minus 165 04923. Read back. Over.
005:45:57|T|LMP|Roger. 01344 4793, minus 165 04923. Over.
005:46:07|T|CC|This is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
005:55:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 55 minutes. Apollo 11's velocity is 11,970 feet per second. Distance from Earth is 25,671 nautical miles.
005:58:34|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
005:58:37|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
005:58:39|T|CMP|Roger. Do you have any update for the roll, pitch and yaw angles on the top of page 37 in the Flight Plan. Or are they still good?
005:58:48|T|CC|That's for the optics calibration?
005:58:50|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
005:58:52|T|CC|Yes, indeed. I'll give them to you in just a second here.
005:59:17|T|CC|Roger, 11. For the optics calibration I've got 346.5 for roll, 345.0 for pitch, and 007.8 for yaw. The pen-and-ink attitude corrections in your book for P23 are good. Over.
005:59:49|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
005:59:54|T|CC|And we're going to hand over to Hawaii in about 5 or 6 seconds, here. We'll have a momentary COMM dropout.
006:00:01|T|CDR|Roger.
006:09:16|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Be advised your friendly White Team has come on for its first shift, and if we can be of service, don't hesitate to call.
006:09:27|T|CMP|Thank you very much. And we're about to take our marks, Charlie, on this P23 optics CAL. I've got it in the sextant now, and I'm about to split the image and Mark.
006:09:41|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We're watching.
006:09:51|P|PAO|The Capcom is now Charlie Duke, and Gene Kranz and his white team of Flight Controllers is preparing to take over the responsibility here in the Control Center from Cliff Charlesworth's team.
006:16:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 16 minutes into the mission. Velocity now 11,479 feet per second. Apollo 11's distance from Earth, 27,938 nautical miles. We're estimating the change-of-shift news conference for 3:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time.
006:19:23|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have scrubbed the mid-course 1. Over.
006:19:30|T|LMP|Roger. Understand you've scrubbed mid-course 1.
006:19:33|T|CC|Roger.
006:21:38|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We see your middle gimbal angle getting pretty big. Over.
006:21:44|T|CMP|Well, it was, Charlie, but in going from one AUTO maneuver to another, we took over control and have gone around gimbal lock; and we're about to give control back to the DAP.
006:21:56|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We see it increasing now.
006:25:35|T|LMP|Hey Charlie?
006:25:44|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
006:25:45|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
006:25:47|T|LMP|Hey, maybe you better call Lou and tell him we might be a little bit late for dinner.
006:25:51|T|CC|Okay. Sure will. We'd like for you to turn on - the fan on in O2 tank number 2, Buzz. And, 11, did you - on your optics calibrations, did you proceed or recall the program? Over.
006:26:08|T|CMP|We recalled the program.
006:26:09|T|CC|Roger.
006:26:11|T|LMP|And O2 fan number 2 is on.
006:26:14|T|CC|Roger.
006:26:42|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I've got a CRYO pressure light and a MASTER ALARM. It's reset.
006:26:51|T|CC|Roger. We expected that. That's why we had you turn the fan on. We were getting pretty close to the caution and warning limits. We were trying to prevent that.
006:27:00|T|LMP|Okay.
006:30:35|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 31 minutes. At the present time the spacecraft is 29,363 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off gradually, reading now 11,192 feet per second. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has taken over as Flight Director now from Clifford Charlesworth. Kranz has been reviewing the status of the spacecraft's systems with his team of Flight Controllers; everything looks very good at this point. The crew has been advised that the mid-course correction 1, the first opportunity for a mid-course correction, which had been scheduled into the Flight Plan at about 13 hours, 30 minutes, will not be performed. A correction of mid-course had been scheduled at 11 hours, 45 minutes into the Flight Plan and that will not be performed according to the tracking data we have at this time. The crew, up until their sleep period which will begin in about 13 hours, 30 minutes or about 7 hours from now will be involved generally in a routine of housekeeping type activities aboard the spacecraft. At the present time they should be involved in some mid-course navigations. At 6 hours, 32 minutes this is Apollo Control of Houston.
006:34:30|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
006:34:36|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
006:34:39|T|CMP|Roger. You're looking at our DELTA-R DELTA-V. It looks like DELTA-R is pretty large, there. We wanted to talk to you about it before we incorporate it.
006:34:46|T|CC|Stand by, Mike. We don't have anything on our downlink here, I don't think, on the DSKY. Stand by.
006:34:51|T|CMP|Okay. Our NOUN 49 is reading: register 1, plus 08793; register 2, all balls.
006:35:01|T|CC|Copy.
006:36:15|T|CC|11, Houston. Guidance is looking at the NOUN 40 - 49 stuff. We'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
006:36:23|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll just hold right here in the program.
006:36:26|T|CC|Roger. We got the downlink now. Over.
006:36:29|T|CMP|Okay.
006:36:56|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to reject the NOUN 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again. Over.
006:37:03|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
006:38:47|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?
006:38:53|T|CC|Roger. We see it. Stand by.
006:40:23|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.
006:40:34|T|CMP|Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?
006:40:46|T|CC|Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.
006:41:09|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do it, then.
006:41:14|T|CC|And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.
006:41:21|T|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
006:42:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. If you like this, we'll accept it as well.
006:42:59|T|CC|Stand by.
006:43:46|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Over.
006:43:51|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll do that now.
006:43:53|T|CC|Thank you.
006:44:40|T|CMP|And we're going to proceed on this one, too, Charlie.
006:44:42|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
006:48:35|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Another NOUN 49 for you.
006:48:40|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Stand by.
006:49:00|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to recycle and do this one over again. Over.
006:49:07|T|CMP|Okay.
006:52:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 52 minutes. Apollo 11 now 31,565 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 10,789 feet per second. The crew at this time is involved in mid-course navigation using their onboard optical system. We have completed the changeover in briefing of shifts here in Mission Control, and the crew activities, until the sleep period begins, will consist of housekeeping, functions aboard the spacecraft, changing out carbon dioxide filters. They will not be doing the mid-course correction scheduled for 11:45 into the flight as the first opportunity. The change-of-shift briefing is scheduled to begin shortly. Any conversations that develop with the crew during that period of time will be tape recorded, and we'll play those back following the change-of-shift briefing. This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 53 minutes.
006:53:41|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
006:53:43|T|CC|Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.
006:53:45|T|LMP|Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.
006:53:50|T|CC|Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.
006:55:49|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12:25 in the Flight Plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.
006:56:05|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.
006:56:10|T|CC|Affirm.
006:56:16|T|CMP|And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the sub-stellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the sub-stellar point on this star? It's our second star.
006:56:31|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
006:57:21|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the Flight Plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the Flight Plan. Over.
006:57:36|T|CMP|Okay. We'll try that.
006:58:28|T|CMP|Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.
006:58:32|T|CC|Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the Flight Plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 130.7. Over.
006:58:47|T|CMP|Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 340.00.
006:58:55|T|CC|That's affirmative.
007:03:32|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the sub-stellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.
007:03:45|T|CC|Roger. We copy it all.
007:09:24|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've run the angles given in the Flight Plan for the P23 attitude through the machines down here, and they come up the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the non-symmetrical horizon might by giving a problem. Over.
007:09:51|T|CMP|Yes, I'd say - It could be, Charlie. Stand by here. We'll get another mark for you.
007:09:54|T|CC|Okay.
007:10:30|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. NOUN 49 for you.
007:10:34|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
007:10:40|T|CC|Stand by.
007:11:05|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. Over.
007:11:15|T|CMP|Okay.
007:20:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?
007:21:04|T|CC|Stand by.
007:21:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 7 hours, 21 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. During the change-of-shift briefing, we accumulated about 4 minutes of tape conversation with the spacecraft. That conversation generally related to the onboard batteries, which are currently being charged - a routine operation - and also the mid-course navigation exercise that the crew is currently involved in. We'll play back the tape for you now, and then stand by for any live conversation with the crew.
007:21:21|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.
007:21:26|T|CMP|Yes. Roger. All right. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?
007:21:30|T|CC|Stand by, Mike.
007:21:31|T|CMP|Okay.
007:21:46|T|CC|11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.
007:21:48|T|CMP|Okay.
007:32:59|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
007:33:02|T|CC|Go ahead. Over.
007:33:04|T|CMP|Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.
007:33:17|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.
007:33:20|T|CMP|Yes. I'd appreciate that.
007:33:49|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.
007:33:53|T|CMP|Okay.
007:33:54|T|CC|And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.
007:34:09|T|CMP|Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the sub-stellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.
007:34:21|T|CC|Roger.
007:34:49|T|CMP|And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?
007:34:58|T|CC|I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.
007:35:01|T|CMP|Okay.
007:35:02|T|CC|That is negative. Stand by one.
007:35:06|T|CMP|Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.
007:35:16|T|CC|Stand by.
007:35:32|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. LMP is back on the line.
007:35:36|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
007:35:40|T|LMP|Read you five-by.
007:35:42|T|CC|Rog. You're same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 197.8 for roll, 128.5 pitch, 340.0 yaw.
007:35:58|T|CMP|Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 313.65. Over.
007:36:15|T|CC|Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.
007:36:31|T|CMP|Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.
007:36:38|T|CC|Roger.
007:43:24|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
007:43:27|T|CC|Go ahead. Over.
007:43:29|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.
007:43:45|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
007:43:48|T|CMP|I think something's wrong with those attitudes.
007:45:15|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.
007:45:22|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
007:45:26|T|CC|Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.
007:45:35|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
007:46:30|T|CC|11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.
007:46:45|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.
007:47:55|T|CMP|Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.
007:48:03|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
007:48:11|T|CMP|It still looks like I'm far from the sub-stellar point. However, I'm off quite a bit in roll.
007:48:18|T|CC|Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.
007:48:28|T|CMP|Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a bit in order to get it parallel to the horizon.
007:48:41|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.
007:48:51|T|CMP|Well, then we're not at the sub-stellar point if we're not.
007:48:54|T|CC|Roger.
007:51:39|T|CMP|Houston, you copy that NOUN 49?
007:51:41|T|CC|Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.
007:52:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter. Over.
007:52:16|T|CMP|Okay.
007:52:55|T|CMP|Do you need me to wait in the NOUN 49 display for any length of time?
007:53:01|T|CC|Negative.
007:53:03|T|CMP|Okay.
007:54:29|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.
007:54:33|T|CC|Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.
007:54:43|T|CMP|Okay.
007:55:20|T|CMP|They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie. Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?
007:55:23|T|CC|Stand by, Mike.
007:55:27|T|CMP|It's no trouble.
007:55:30|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. Out.
007:56:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do two more on star 45. Over.
007:56:14|T|CMP|Okay.
007:58:02|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. There's your two more marks. Where do you want to go from here?
007:58:05|T|CC|Stand by.
007:58:21|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 195.2, pitch 123.9, yaw 340.0. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.
007:58:45|T|CMP|Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, pitch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.
007:58:57|T|CC|That's affirmative.
007:59:00|T|CMP|Okay.
008:02:07|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, I'm misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.
008:02:20|T|CC|Stand by.
008:02:40| T|CMP|See, if my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the sub-stellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.
008:02:50|T|CC|Stand by one. Over.
008:02:52|T|CMP|Okay.
008:03:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike. The horizon looks cocked off to you - You look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent LM reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a - You should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is. Over.
008:03:54|T|CMP|Okay.
008:04:08|T|CMP|I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.
008:04:14|T|CC|Copy.
008:05:08|T|CMP|VERB or - NOUN 49 for you, Charlie.
008:05:13|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
008:05:45|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to accept this one and give us two more and that will be enough. Over.
008:05:52|T|CMP|Okay.
008:08:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 8 minutes. Apollo 11 now 38,812 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 9,682 feet per second. And we've just put in a call to the crew; we'll stand by for - -
008:08:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see your termination on P23. Thank you very much. Mike, we'll have a - We're trying to work up a story here for you; we'll be with you momentarily on an explanation of what's happening. Over.
008:08:38|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the sub-stellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.
008:08:56|T|CC|Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
008:09:03|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
008:11:00|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have a PTC REFSMMAT for you momentarily. Over.
008:11:13|T|CDR|Roger. Going P00 and ACCEPT.
008:11:25|P|PAO|The PTC REFSMMAT, which Capcom, Charlie Duke, just referred to is the Passive Thermal Control attitude that the crew will place the spacecraft in. In this attitude the spacecraft will be rotated at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature balance.
008:13:55|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're through with the load. You can go back to BLOCK.
008:14:01|T|CDR|You're BLOCK. Thank you.
008:24:44|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to do a P52, option 1 preferred, and establish PTC as listed in the Flight Plan at 12 hours. We'd like you to commence that right now, Mike. And we have some stars recommended for you. For stars 26, 30, and 24, when you get to attitude 000. Over.
008:25:19|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. He's off the wick right now. Understand you're ready for us to do a P52, option 1?
008:25:31|T|CC|11, it's a P52, option 1 preferred. Over.
008:25:36|T|CDR|Roger. And, let's see, that is Spica, Menkent, and what else?
008:25:43|T|CC|Roger. Stars - Codes are stars 26, 30, and 24. Over.
008:25:49|T|CDR|24. Okay.
008:35:43|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We notice your PROGRAM ALARM, Mike, was due to using these stars in the P23 attitude. If you'll go to 000, the stars we gave you will work. Over.
008:36:02|T|CMP|Okay. Understand.
008:41:19|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Prior to you starting your P52, we'd like to give you a new CSM state vector. Over.
008:41:29|T|CDR|Roger. Wait till we finish the maneuver and we'll give you the DSKY.
008:41:37|T|CC|Roger. We're standing by.
008:53:07|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The DSKY is yours.
008:53:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
008:53:15|T|CMP|Roger. The DSKY is yours.
008:53:17|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
008:59:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 59 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft altitude is currently reading 42,753 nautical miles, and we show a velocity of about 9,100 feet per second. We are in the process now of up linking to the space craft attitude for the Passive Thermal Control mode. Under this mode the spacecraft will be rotated about its X axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperature balance within the spacecraft. The crew has completed the mid-course navigation exercise. They will shortly be aligning the spacecraft stable platform, used as a attitude reference in the guidance system. This is a routine procedure, and following that, the spacecraft will be placed in the Passive Thermal Control mode where normally it would be left during the sleep period. The cabin temperature in the Command Module, has been running between 65 and 70 degrees. The current spacecraft weight is 96,460 pounds.
009:00:59|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can do the VERB 66. The computer is yours, and then the P52, option 1 preferred. Over.
009:01:07|T|CMP|Roger.
009:12:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 13 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Based on biomedical data, a Flight Surgeon reports that it appears the crew removed their pressure garments - their pressure suits at about 8:00pm for the Commander, Neil Armstrong and Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin apparently got out of his pressure suit about 1 hour earlier or about 7 hours Ground Elapsed Time. The spacecraft is currently 44,529 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity has dropped now to 8,983 feet per second. We do have, rather poor lock with the spacecraft antenna at this time accounting for the noise on the air to ground circuit. We'll take down the circuit until we've reestablished better lock, and we'll record any conversations that occur in the interim. At 9 hours, 14 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
009:16:10|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.
009:18:11|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our COMM. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred ...
009:18:25|T|CMP|... not a very good attitude at all for COMM, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.
009:18:34|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy. Recommend you go to this P52, option 1 preferred, and then go to PTC attitude. Over. Then we'll get some COMM. When you get there to PTC attitude, it'll be pitch 90, yaw 0 on the high-gain. Over.
009:21:17|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
009:21:19|T|CC|Roger, 11. You're about one-by. Go ahead.
009:21:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You're about one-by. Go ahead. Over.
009:22:40|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
009:22:43|T|CC|Roger, 11. Read you about four-by. How me? Over.
009:22:46|T|CMP|You're loud and clear, Charlie. We pitched down some to get a better COMM attitude.
009:22:52|T|CC|Roger. Did you copy our recommendation on proceeding with the P52, Mike? Over.
009:22:57|T|CMP|Negative. We didn't. I've got that in work. I'm starting on P52.
009:23:01|T|CC|Roger.
009:35:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
009:35:59|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
009:36:01|T|CMP|Roger. Copy our torquing angles. We're about to torque them.
009:36:05|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
009:36:07|T|CMP|Roger. The reason for delay there, Charlie, is that - difficult to find two stars that are not occulted by the LM and also are not in the midst of a man-made star field up here with dumps.
009:36:17|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 36 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission continuing to go smoothly at this point. The communications noise that we were experiencing previously cleared up after the crew was able to get the spacecraft in a good attitude for antenna log-on and we had one brief conversation which we taped and we're presently communicating with the crew at this time. We'll pick up the tape and then continue to follow live conversation.
009:36:21|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
009:36:39|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can torque the NOUN 93. Over.
009:36:44|T|CMP|Okay.
009:38:48|P|PAO|That brings us up to date with the taped conversation that we had. We'll continue to stand by for any live communications with the spacecraft. Most of that conversation with Mike Collins involved the platform alignment which the crew is involved in at the present time, aligning the stable platform used by the Guidance System as an attitude reference. Apollo 11 is presently 46,688 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 8,750 feet per second.
009:40:34|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. That completes the P52. We verified the third star with Antares, and AUTO optics are pointing at it pretty closely. How do our platform drift angles look so far, Charlie?
009:40:46|T|CC|Stand by.
009:40:56|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We didn't have a chance to get a good check for you. We're going to run a drift check from this alignment until the next one, approximately 12 hours, and we'll have something for you later. Over.
009:41:07|T|CMP|Okay.
009:41:46|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to establish your PTC. We recommend you select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.
009:42:14|T|CDR|Roger. Understand. Alfa and Delta quads for the PTC.
009:42:19|T|CC|That's affirmative.
009:52:54|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that the ATTITUDE SET switch is in GDC? Over.
009:53:06|T|CDR|The SET switch. Stand by one, Charlie.
009:53:10|T|CC|Roger.
009:53:12|T|CDR|It is now.
009:53:14|T|CC|Roger. It was on IMU.
009:53:17|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
009:53:18|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
010:03:29|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How many miles out do you have us now?
010:03:33|T|CC|We have you - Stand by, Buzz. Roughly about 50,000. Stand by.
010:03:41|T|LMP|It's a beautiful sight.
010:03:47|T|CDR|Charlie, on that PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. You might let us know how that's coming.
010:03:54|T|CC|Roger. Will do. We have you about 48,000 miles now.
010:03:59|T|CMP|Thank you.
010:05:34|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We still have our oxygen fan on for tank 2. Is that what you want?
010:05:40|T|CC|Stand by.
010:05:46|T|LMP|Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.
010:05:58|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Copy. Looks like there's a good view out there then.
010:06:04|T|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to keep the O2 fan on. It will give you an ECS configuration prior to sleep. Over.
010:06:14|T|CMP|Okay, fine.
010:06:47|T|LMP|Charlie, with the monocular, I can discern a definite green cast to the San Fernando Valley.
010:06:57|T|CC|Roger.
010:07:00|T|CC|How's Baja California look, Buzz?
010:07:08|T|LMP|Well, it's got some clouds up and down it, and there's a pretty good circulation system a couple of hundred miles off the west coast of California.
010:07:21|T|CC|Roger. 11, we'd like you to close the waste storage vent valve right now.
010:07:29|T|CMP Okay.
010:07:49|T|CMP|Waste storage vent valves closed.
010:07:51|T|CC|Copy.
010:08:52|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like - The rates are looking pretty good right now on the PTC, but we'd like you to continue holding. Over.
010:09:00|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
010:20:30|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your rates look really great, now. You can start your PTC.
010:20:36|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Charlie.
010:21:52|T|CDR|Houston, you read 11?
010:21:54|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.
010:21:56|T|CDR|Roger. If you'd like to delay PTC just for 10 minutes or so, we can shoot you some TV of a seven-eights Earth. That's - We'll leave that up to you.
010:22:12|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
010:22:50|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll have our answer for you on the TV in about 1 minute. Over.
010:25:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.
010:25:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready at Goldstone for the TV. It'll be recorded at Goldstone and then replayed back over here, Neil, any time you want to turn her on, we're ready. Over.
010:26:10|T|CDR|Okay. It'll take us about 5 minutes to get rigged.
010:26:13|T|CC|Roger.
010:26:20|P|PAO|Capcom, Charlie Duke, advised the crew that we would be recording the television at Goldstone. We don't have an estimate at this time as to how long it will take to get a playback of that from Goldstone.
010:26:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you verify the reading on your O2 flow indicator? Over.
010:26:45|T|CDR|We're showing 0.2. We just inadvertently touched the RAPID REPRESS button. That made a temporary glitch in the flow.
010:26:56|T|CC|Roger. During that glitch there, did it go almost a peg high? Over.
010:27:05|T|CDR|I'd believe that.
010:27:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you tell us - tell us if the O2 flow indicator was pegged to HIGH prior to closing the waste storage vent valve? Over.
010:27:26|T|LMP|No, it was not.
010:27:28|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
010:31:00|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. A while ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the AUTO drive on the high-gain. We'd like you to position the antenna at pitch 30, yaw 270, go to REACQ and that will give us narrow beam-width. Over.
010:31:27|T|CDR|That yaw 270 and pitch 3 - What was the pitch?
010:31:32|T|CC|Pitch 30, Neil.
010:31:35|T|CDR|Okay. I think we've got you.
010:31:45|T|CC|Roger. We've got a good signal there. Thank you much.
010:32:20|T|CDR|... Okay, Houston. We are sending a picture of Earth down right now, so you can let us know if they're receiving at Goldstone.
010:32:36|T|CC|Roger, 11. Goldstone is receiving the TV. Stand by. We'll let you know on the quality. Over.
010:33:35|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says that the TV looks great. Over.
010:33:45|T|CDR|Okay, roger. We're zooming in on the Earth now.
010:33:53|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Did you copy? Over.
010:33:57|T|LMP|... Roger. We copied, Charlie.
010:34:04|T|CC|Roger. Your transmissions the last couple of times have been about two-by. Over.
010:34:10|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read me now?
010:34:11|T|CC|Roger. You're five-by now.
010:34:13|T|LMP|Okay. We're zooming the lens on in until it will just about fill the monitor.
010:34:20|T|CC|Roger.
010:34:35|T|CDR|Okay. It's in full zoom, now.
010:34:41|T|CC|Copy, 11.
010:34:45|T|CDR|And how about the f-stop? Is 22 going to be adequate?
010:34:49|T|CC|Stand by. We'll get with the Goldstone TV guy. We don't have anything here at Houston. Stand by.
010:35:01|T|CMP|It looks good on the monitor, as far as the f-stop goes. Therefore, we just assumed it's okay at Goldstone.
010:35:27|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says it - TV looks really great, five-by; we don't - The AGC looks like it's working fine. The f/22 is good; we have no real white spots. They're real pleased with it. Over.
010:35:42|T|CDR|Okay. You just cut out, Charlie. We understand that it's looking great. We'll leave it the way it is and wait for you to come back on.
010:35:51|T|CC|Roger. How do you read me now? Over.
010:35:54|T|CDR|Five-by.
010:35:55|T|CC|Okay. My comments were - My comments were from Goldstone that they see no white spots as we saw in 10. Looks like the AGC's working real well. The f/22 looks good. Over.
010:36:08|T|CDR|Okay. Very good. Well, we shut out the Sun coming in from the other windows into the spacecraft, so it's looking through a - the number 1 window, and there isn't any reflected light ... now. So, it ought to be a pretty good picture.
010:36:24|T|CC|Roger.
010:37:05|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to keep the TV on for about 10 minutes or so, so we can get come good comparison on the camera. You can do anything your heart desires on the TV: interior, exterior, pan in and out, anything you'd like. Over.
010:37:46|T|CC|11, Houston. Over.
010:38:04|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
010:38:06|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.
010:38:08|T|CMP|Charlie, I'm sorry; you keep cutting out. We heard up to "you can do anything," and then after that we didn't hear anything, and we knew that wasn't right anyhow because we can't. But what do you want us to do?
010:38:22|T|CC|Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back in to us. What we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. On the exterior shots, we'd like to look - -
010:38:47|T|CMP|You cut out again.
010:38:48|T|CC|Stand by.
010:38:52|T|CMP|Start over with, "we were saying."
010:39:37|T|LMP|Hey, Houston. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we can get a little bit more than just water?
010:39:45|T|CC|Roger, 11. I don't think we got much control over that. Looks like you'll have to settle for the water.
010:40:02|T|CC|11, Houston. We're going to change - thinking about changing our voice uplink to another site. If you'll stand by, we'll see if we can improve the quality. Over.
010:40:11|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
010:40:12|T|LMP|We'll stand by for your call.
010:40:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll try once more on this TV request. We'd like 10 minutes worth of TV. And we'd like a narrative, if you could give us one, on the exterior shots. You could also - we also suggest you might try the - an interior position. Over.
010:41:10|T|CDR|Roger. We're seeing the center of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America. The United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia. I'm not sure you'll be able to see all that on your screen down there ...
010:42:05|T|CC|Roger, Neil. We just wanted a narrative such that we can - When we get the playback, we can sort of correlate what we're seeing. Thank you very much.
010:42:20|T|CMP|I haven't seen anything but the DSKY so far.
010:42:25|T|CC|Looks like they're hogging the windows.
010:42:29|T|LMP|You're right.
010:46:59|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. On your CRYO's, we'd like at this time for you to place all four CRYO heaters to AUTO and turn off all four CRYO fans. Over.
010:47:15|T|LMP|Okay. All four CRYO heaters are AUTO. And all four CRYO fans are off. ...
010:47:26|T|CC|Roger. That's going to be your sleep configuration.
010:47:29|T|LMP|Okay.
010:47:30|T|CC|And, Buzz, we'll be terminating the battery charge in about a half hour.
010:47:35|T|LMP|Roger.
010:47:59|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the TV at your convenience. We've got enough take. And you can start PTC at your convenience. The rates look super for starting up. Over.
010:48:14|T|CDR|Roger, Charlie.
010:50:35|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours, 51 minutes. That TV transmission lasted about 15 minutes. Goldstone reported that we did get good quality on it. We estimate that it will be somewhere between an hour and a half or two hours before we have the television available here in Houston to play back. The lines will have to be called up between Goldstone and Mission Control Center, and the conversion equipment brought up online before we'll be able to play back the television from that transmission. At the beginning of the TV transmission, the spacecraft was approximately 50,980 nautical miles from Earth, and at the conclusion they were about 52,248 nautical miles from Earth.
010:57:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have a Flight Plan update for you and some P37 block data, if you're ready to copy. Over.
010:57:42|T|CMP|Stand by.
010:58:19|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. PTC is started now; looks good to us, and we'll be ready to copy in a minute or two.
010:58:25|T|CC|Roger. Copy, 11.
010:58:59|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy the Flight Plan update and P37.
010:59:05|T|CC|Roger. Stand by one, Buzz.
010:59:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Coming at you with the P37 block data. Over.
010:59:29|T|LMP|Okay.
010:59:30|T|CC|Roger. 027 44 5363, minus 165 07314 03744 8016, minus 165 072 46; GETI 046 44 6141, minus 165 09703 05544 8209, minus 165 09642. Ready for your readback. Over.
011:01:02|T|LMP|Roger. 027 44 5363, minus 165 07314 03744 8016, minus 165 072 46; 046 44 6141, minus 165 09703 05544 8209, minus 165 09642. Over.
011:01:55|T|CC|Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a Flight Plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and that you can do them at your convenience and then go to sleep early, if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O2 fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM DELTA-P, and accomplish the pre-sleep checklist.
011:02:34|T|LMP|Okay. We've completed the filter change, and we'll get started on the fuel cell purge, and stand by for the LM/CM DELTA-P.
011:02:42|T|CC|Roger, 11. Would you hold off on the fuel cell purge? EECOMM is saying we might not have to do that. Over.
011:02:51|T|CDR|Okay.
011:03:05|T|CMP|Charlie, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.5.
011:03:09|T|CC|Copy. 0.5. Out.
011:03:56|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've just decided to delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.
011:04:02|T|CDR|Roger. Delete the O2 fuel cell purge.
011:06:21|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.
011:07:19|T|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.
011:07:22|T|CC|Roger.
011:07:28|T|CMP|Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?
011:07:42|T|CC|That's negative. That question's answered. Thank you much.
011:07:46|T|CMP|Okay.
011:09:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. During that last transmission you heard Capcom, Charlie Duke advise the crew that we are not seeing as high an O2, or oxygen flow, as we would have expected at this point. This would indicate that the enrichment of the cabin atmosphere, which was 60 percent oxygen, 40 percent nitrogen at launch and which is normally enriched with pure oxygen during the course of the/flight, is not enriching as rapidly as we would expect. This could be a transducer problem - one of the devices that measures the O2 flow rate - or possibly a partial obstruction of one of the vents. The problem is not thought to be significant at this point, and we'll be monitoring the O2 flow during the night.
011:09:53|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have an S-band configuration for you. Over.
011:09:59|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.
011:10:01|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. We'd like you to place the S-band antenna OMNI A switch to the Bravo position. S-band antenna OMNI switch to the OMNI position, the high-gain track to MANUAL, and the high-gain angles will be yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.
011:10:26|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. OMNI to Baker and OMNI, MANUAL. And the angles are yaw 270, pitch minus 50, and was that narrow or wide? Over.
011:10:47|T|CC|Stand by. Roger. We'd like it in WIDE, and you can set that configuration up now. Over.
011:10:56|T|LMP|It's in work.
011:13:04|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate battery Bravo charge, and we'd like a crew status report. We're about to tell you good night. Over.
011:13:14|T|CDR|Roger. Stand by.
011:18:08|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The battery charging is complete, and the crew status report is as follows: radiation, CDR 11002, CMP 10002, LMP 09003; negative medication; fit as a fiddle. Over.
011:18:33|T|CC|Roger. Copy, 11. Thank you much. We'd like to ask one question. Have you tried the gas separator on the water, and how is that working? Over.
011:18:46|T|CDR|Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments on that.
011:18:50|T|CMP|It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tube-full we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.
011:19:31|T|CC|Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on DOWNVOICE BACKUP. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some Z's. Over.
011:19:53|T|CMP|Okay. Maybe we'll get around to lunch.
011:19:56|T|CC|How about a peanut butter and jelly?
011:29:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 29 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We don't expect to hear a great deal more from the crew tonight. At about 11 hours, 20 minutes we said good-night to them from Mission Control and they're beginning their sleep period about 2 hours early. The additional time available for sleep was made available by deleting the mid-course correction. The first opportunity which occurred at 11 hours, 45 minutes. That mid-course correction has been moved to mid-course correction 2 to the opportunity of mid-course correction 2 of which would occur tomorrow. The last conversation we had with the crew, we received a status report and a report that they had taken no medication and were "fit as a fiddle". We also got a report from Mike Collins on the gas separation unit which is being flown on this flight. This consists of 2 stainless steel cylinders about 5 inches long and about an inch to an inch and half in diameter. The cylinders are attached to the water gun or to the water spigot on the food preparation panel and remove the gas from the water as it flows through the filter. The filter actually has two filters inside. One which attracts water and one which repels it, in the process removing the gas. Mike Collins reported that the filters seem to be working quite well. That the water was coming out almost free of bubbles. He did report that they had a minor problem with a leak at the junction between the food bag and the filter. Mission Control advised that we would give that some thought and try to come up with some solution to it when they wake up tomorrow. At this time, Apollo 11 is 55,522 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 7,920 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 32 minutes.
011:47:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 47 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. At this time we are receiving the television data from Goldstone. The data is coming in. It will be processed here and converted, and we estimate that it will be available for playback in about 20 to 30 minutes and we will have a firm time on that as soon as possible. At the present time Apollo 11 is 56,704 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity is 7,821 feet per second. We have had no further conversations with the crew since we passed along a good night to them at 11 hours 20 minutes. Getting them to bed about 2 hours ahead of the scheduled time on the Flight Plan, as a result of the deletion of mid-course correction 1. At 11 hours 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
012:05:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 5 minutes. We expect to have the unscheduled television transmission, which came in to Goldstone California and  was taped there and has been transmitted to Mission Control Center ready and converted for replay in color at 8:45pm Central Daylight Time. That would be about 7 minutes from now. The TV transmission runs for a total time of about 16 and a half minutes and there's an exterior shot out the window of the Earth. At the time of the transmission Apollo 11 was some 50 thousand 9 hundred 80 nautical miles from Earth. The transmission came into Goldstone at the Ground Elapsed Time of 10:32:40, and ended about 16 minutes, 16 and a half minutes later, when the spacecraft was at an altitude of 52,248 nautical miles. We'll stand by for a replay of that transmission at 8:45pm Central Daylight Time.
012:11:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 12 minutes, and we expect to be ready to release the television transmission from the spacecraft which was received at Goldstone, California. That should be ready to go in a little less than a minute.
012:12:48|P|PAO|And we are starting to get lock-on from the tape replay and we expect that we will have a color picture shortly.
012:24:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view we have of the Earth disc at this time as near as we can tell, the north Pole is to the left of the screen. The land mass that was visible was the western coast of the United States. The Earth then would appear to be rotated 90 degrees with the North Pole to the left and South American Continent extending toward the upper right of the globe but not visible.
012:29:41|P|PAO|That concludes the unscheduled television transmission. That transmission came in about 2 hours ago at a Ground Elapsed Time of 10:32:40 beginning, lasted about 16 and a half minutes. At the beginning of the transmission Apollo 11 was about 50,980 nautical miles from Earth and at the conclusion about 52,248 nautical miles. At the present time, the crew is in a scheduled rest period. They did indicate before going into the rest period, when we last heard from them, that they would probably use part of the time to get a bite to eat and then get some sleep. At this time Apollo 11 is 59,908 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,569 feet per second. At 12 hours 31 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
012:36:35|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Hope you aren't - we aren't disturbing you. We'd like you to terminate the NOUN 65 now. Over.
012:36:43|T|CMP|Roger.
012:46:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
012:46:06|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11 ...
012:46:09|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. When you stopped - or, correction - When you terminated the NOUN 65, it appears to us, you get a VERB 46 which collapsed the deadband back to 0.5. We're okay as long as you do not turn on any AUTO RCS SELECT switches. Over.
012:46:30|T|LMP|Okay. I thought that was a - better way to clear the DSKY but evidently it isn't. Roger.
012:46:37|T|CC|Roger. VERB 34 would have been a better procedure.
012:46:42|T|LMP|Yes. Thank you.
012:47:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 47 minutes. We've just put in a call to the crew. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, verified with the surgeon that they had not gone to sleep at this point and Capsule Communicator, Charlie Duke, has put in the call. We'll pick up the tape of the conversation and then stand by for any following live communication with the crew.
012:51:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We don't anticipate a great deal of further conversation with the crew. We expect they will attempt to get some sleep shortly. The conversation that just ended, we advised that through one of the computer programs, the deadband, or that area of excursions which the guidance system will allow before firing the RCS thrusters to correct it, had been narrowed from 30 degrees to 1/2 a degree. What this would mean, if the RCS jets were enabled, is that unless the crew reselected the 30 degree deadband, the jets would be firing more frequently to keep the spacecraft within the narrower limits. Since the spacecraft is very stable at this point, very few wobbling motions, it was felt that the narrower deadband was acceptable; the jets are not enabled, and the crew would not be disturbed by firing of the Reaction Control System jets even if the spacecraft moved out of the 1/2-degree deadband. In the event of any large excursions, which we would not expect, based on the Passive Thermal Control mode, used in Apollo 10, it would be possible to awaken the crew from the ground and have the situation corrected. We would not expect, however, for the spacecraft attitude to change significantly during the night, and we do intend to continue in the Passive Thermal Control mode as it is presently set up. At this time Apollo 11 is 61,509 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,449 feet per second, which would translate to about 5,000 miles an hour. At 12 hours 54 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
013:27:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours, 27 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft now traveling at a speed of 7,279 feet per second, which would be about 4,963 miles an hour, and it's at a distance of 63,880 nautical miles from Earth. Our Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, appeared to be sleeping soundly at this time. Biomedical data on the other two crewmen indicates that they are still awake. We've had no further conversation with the spacecraft since our last report, and it appears that the crew will be getting some good rest either as scheduled or perhaps a little earlier than scheduled in the Flight Plan. At 13 hours, 28 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
014:06:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 14 hours 6 minute into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission is progressing very smoothly. All spacecraft systems are functioning normally at this time, and the Flight Surgeon reports that all three crewmen appear to be sleeping. For Commander, Neil Armstrong, and Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, they appear to have begun sleeping about 5 minutes ago. Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins has been asleep for about an additional 30 minutes to an hour. At the present time Apollo 11 is 66,554 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of about 70 thousand, or rather 7,095 feet per second, which would be about 4,800 miles an hour. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report and, as I said, all 3 crewmen appear to be sleeping at this time. At 14 hours 7 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
014:25:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 14 hours, 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft, presently 67,819 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 7,012 feet per second. Here in Mission Control, the shift change is in progress. Flight Director, Glenn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers coming on to replace Gene Kranz and his white team. The Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be Ron Evans. And we anticipate that the change-of-shift briefing for this shift will begin in about 10 or 15 minutes. At 14 hours, 26 minutes this is Apollo Control.
015:27:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 15 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew still asleep according to Flight Surgeon, Ken Beers here in Mission Control. The flight crew is still sleeping soundly at this time according to the biomedical telemetry being beamed down to the displays on his console. Here in the Mission Control Operations Room, or MOCR as it's called, the Black Team of Flight Controllers is settling in for the night headed up by Flight Director Glen Lunney. Some 7 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. Distance and velocity now showing 72,009 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now 6,750 feet per second. And at 15 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
016:38:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 hours, 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11, presently being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station. Geographically, the spacecraft is practically directly over or out from the Philippine Islands. Now showing some 5 hours and 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period, the crew still asleep at this time. Continuing to decelerate as the spacecraft gets out toward the changeover point between the Earth's sphere of influence and the Moon's sphere of influence. Velocity now showing 6,493 feet per second. Apollo 11 now out 76,453 nautical miles from the Earth. And at 16 hours, 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
017:33:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 17 hours 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now some 79,700 nautical miles out from Earth at a velocity of 6,320 feet per second. Telemetry display for the crew biomedical readings now shows all three men in a fairly deep sleep. The mean heart rates in the 40's for all three men. Command Module cabin pressure holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Cabin temperature is 63 degrees. No measurements on the Lunar Module in terms of cabin pressure in as much as the Lunar Module has not been activated and will not be until shortly before entering Lunar orbit and the first manning for the module is checked out, systems are checked out and closed back up again. Spacecraft analysis reports coming out of the back room here in Mission Control Center read like some of the ones in Apollo 10 toward the end of the mission when they were down to one page. And most of the entries are all systems performance normal, systems operation normal, no change from last report, et cetera, et cetera. In the spacecraft fuel cell, performance is normal. And the load sharing is shown within 3.2 amps. Cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen quantities now show total oxygen at 558 pounds, 279 pounds in each of the two tanks, 49 pounds of cryogenic hydrogen, 24.2 pounds in Tank 1, 24.8 in Tank 2. And the cryogenic system is performing normal. At 17 hours 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
017:33:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 18 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now some 83,644 nautical miles out from Earth, continuing to decelerate in velocity. Now some 6,114 feet per second. The reveille time for the crew of Apollo 11 in some 3 hours and 50 minutes. All systems still functioning normally aboard the spacecraft as the crew continues their nine hour rest period. All measurements normal, as the Flight Controllers here watch the systems on telemetry and the displays here in the Control Center. At 18 hours 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
019:43:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 19 hours, 43 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Crew now has some 2 hours, 46 minutes remaining in the scheduled sleep period. Distance out-bound from Earth now 87,409 nautical miles. Apollo 11's continuing to decelerate in velocity, now traveling at 5,930 feet per second. All going well in the Apollo 11 mission. Crew sleeping apparently in deep sleep. Systems still performing quite well. And at 19 hours, 43 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
020:38:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 20 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. One hour 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. At this time, Apollo 11 on a line projected outward from Earth is directly over the southern tip of the Indian sub-continent. Distance now 90,509 nautical miles. Velocity continuing to decelerate, now 5,788 feet per second. The crew is still asleep at this time, and at 20 hours 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.
021:38:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 21 hours, 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now being tracked by the tracking station at Madrid. Some 51 minutes remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew of Apollo 11. When the sleep period ends depends on the business of the day, whether the Flight Controllers here and the Spacecraft Communicator wake the crew up, or whether they call in to begin the second day of translunar coast. Upon wakening, the Flight Plan calls for change of the carbon dioxide removers in the spacecraft cabin, a report on the differential pressure between the Lunar Module and the Command Module, update from the ground on consumables remaining. We will remain in the Passive Thermal Control mode through the hour-long eat period that follows the wakeup. After their breakfast meal, the Flight Plan calls for some navigation exercises using the sextant and the Program 23 computations of the onboard computer. These are star and Earth horizon sightings. Presently, Apollo 11 is some 93,885 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity, now 5,638 feet per second. At 21 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
022:49:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 22 hours, 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew has been awake for some time according to the surgeon. Spacecraft Communicator here in Mission Control with the Green Team, Bruce McCandless, is standing by to make a call to the crew. He's in the process of taking over from Ron Evans. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth, has asked that he make a call to the crew. We're standing by for this call momentarily.
022:50:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
022:50:18|T|LMP|Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.
022:50:21|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Good morning.
022:50:29|T|CC|When you're ready to copy, 11, I've got a couple of small Flight Plan updates and your consumables update, and the morning news, I guess. Over.
022:51:52|T|LMP|Apollo 11. ...
022:51:55|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
022:51:59|T|LMP|Roger. Standing by for your updates. Over.
022:52:07|T|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. At time approximately 22:30 in the Flight Plan, in your post-sleep checklist, and in all other post-sleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. And in the CSM checklist on page Foxtrot 9-8: if you want to turn to that, we'd like to change the order of the steps in that. Over.
022:53:10|T|LMP|Stand by.
022:53:34|T|LMP|Okay. Page F 9-8. Go ahead.
022:53:37|T|CC|Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.
022:54:13|T|LMP|Roger. I copy. Is that AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A, MAIN B to be the ...
022:54:22|T|CC|Roger. It should be the second step in that procedure. At time 22:40, or when you get to it, we'd like to commence a charge on battery A. And at time 24:10, we have an updated attitude for your P52 and optics calibration. Over.
022:55:04|T|LMP|Okay. 24:10. Go ahead.
022:55:07|T|CC|Roger. P52 and optics calibration attitude: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, yaw 000.0. The nominal attitude that's pen-and-inked in for the P23 is still good. At time 25:30, approximately, after you complete P23, we're requesting a wastewater dump down to a nominal 25 percent. Over.
022:56:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Did you copy the attitudes and the wastewater dump? Over.
022:56:58|T|LMP|Roger, Bruce. ...
022:57:13|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're not reading you at the present time. You're way down in the noise level. Stand by, please.
022:57:22|T|LMP|Okay. Standing by.
022:59:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
022:59:07|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Loud and clear. How me?
022:59:10|T|CC|Okay. Beautiful. Did you copy the attitudes for the P52 and the wastewater dump? Over.
022:59:18|T|LMP|Roger. Okay. We note the battery charge as soon as we get around to it, and the attitude for the P52 optics CAL: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, and yaw all zeros. The attitude for the P23 as in the Flight Plan is okay; and I copy your battery charge. Crew status report as follows: sleep CDR 7, CMP 7, LMP 5.5. And we've completed the post-sleep checklist. Standing by for a consumable update. Over.
023:00:03|T|CC|Roger. We're requesting a wastewater dump at GET 25:30 down to a nominal 25 percent, and here we go with the consumables update. At GET of 22 hours, RCS total is minus 3.5 percent. Alfa minus 3.5 percent, Bravo minus 1.5 percent, Charlie minus 5.0 percent, minus 4.0 percent, H2 minus 2 pounds, O2 minus 4 pounds. Over.
023:00:57|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
023:01:07|T|LMP|I copied those consumables, and I'll read you back our RCS quantities. We got 86 percent in Alfa, 87 in Bravo, 88 in Charlie, and 90 in Delta. Over.
023:01:35|T|CC|Roger. I copy.
023:01:44|T|CC|And did you copy the wastewater request?
023:01:48|T|LMP|Roger. Waste water at - and we got the time on that, and it will be down to 25 percent.
023:01:54|T|CC|Okay.
023:06:44|T|LMP|Houston, 11.
023:06:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
023:06:54|T|LMP|Roger. We've started charging battery A, and voltage started off a lot higher than I expected. It was just a little bit shy of 40. It looks like it's dropping down some now, the battery charge holder. Seemed to me yesterday when we were doing this on battery C, it started out initially, and it went lower, the battery charge holder. Over.
023:07:18|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a second, and I'll get some reading on that.
023:07:27|T|LMP|On charging battery A: now, it's at about 393 and - oh, about 1.5 amps. Looks like it's gradually increasing in the ...
023:07:40|T|CC|Roger. On our CM,.we're showing you at 39.11, and your current's about what you reported.
023:07:49|T|LMP|Okay. I guess you're happy, then.
023:07:56|T|CC|I think we're losing you in the noise again, 11. Stand by.
023:10:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
023:10:37|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
023:10:39|T|CC|Roger, 11. On your battery charging question, we feel that it's probably a difference between individual batteries; and it does seem to have gone away as sort of a startup transient here. Other factors that might conceivably have an influence on it would be battery temperature, things of this sort. EECOMM seems to feel that it's operating within the normal design limits. Over.
023:11:10|T|LMP|All right. Very good. Thank you.
023:11:12|T|CC|Okay.
023:14:07|T|CC|11, this is Houston. If you are interested in the morning news, I have a summary here from PAO. Over.
023:14:18|T|LMP|Okay. We're all listening.
023:14:20|T|CC|Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moonshot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moonstruck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities. Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster was found. Over.
023:18:06|T|LMP|Roger. Thank you, Bruce. Another thing on that number 2 item, we all ... before we left, and we hope we get a chance to see him another time. Over.
023:18:26|T|CC|Roger. And I understand he was down there and really enjoyed watching the launch. We all think it was pretty magnificent, and you all are doing great job up there.
023:18:38|T|CDR|Thank you.
023:22:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours 22 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 99,308 nautical miles. Velocity is 5,411 feet per second. The spacecraft weight is 96,361 pounds. 
023:22:50|P|PAO|A flight dynamics officer reports that in terms of distance Apollo 11 will reach the half-way mark at 25 hours 0 minutes 53 seconds. At that time the spacecraft will be 104,350 miles from both the Earth and the Moon.
023:48:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours, 48 minutes. Capcom, Bruce McCandless is getting ready to put in a call to the crew momentarily. Apollo 11's distance now is 100,685 nautical miles. Velocity 5,356 feet per second.
023:57:01|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
023:57:07|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
023:57:09|T|CC|Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on the performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.
023:57:21|T|LMP|He's all ears.
023:57:22|T|CMP|Yes. Go ahead.
023:57:24|T|CC|Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today, and I'm sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth's horizon at the sub-stellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94, that's VERB 94, to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers. Over.
023:59:41|T|CMP|Well, Roger. Stand by one. We're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.
023:59:48|T|CC|Okay.
024:00:36|P|PAO|Apollo 11 is now going out of the Passive Thermal Control mode in which it was slowly rotating to maintain thermal balance. They're getting set up for the P23 activities. That's the mid-course navigation. Capcom, Bruce McCandless is passing up some changes in the procedures for this navigational operation.
024:02:08|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
024:02:11|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
024:02:14|T|CMP|Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to the P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you give me to go to for the sub-stellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.
024:02:45|T|CC|Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.
024:02:57|T|CMP|Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an excessive attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.
024:03:48|T|CC|Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.
024:04:24|T|CMP|Okay.
024:10:55|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
024:10:59|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
024:11:01|T|LMP|Roger. I'm getting ready to do an O2 Fuel cell purge. Do you have any particulars on this? And I assume you want these one at a time, or can I triple up? Over.
024:11:12|T|CC|We'd like them one at a time, and stand by. I don't think we have any sequence. You can do them in any order you want.
024:11:22|T|CMP|Okay.
024:11:26|T|CC|And we're watching you on TM down here.
024:15:00|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You want to look at these NOUN 93's before I proceed on them?
024:15:08|T|CC|Yes, please. Stand by a second.
024:15:11|T|CMP|Okay.
024:16:10|T|CC|11, this is Houston. On our TM, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. Can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?
024:16:21|T|CMP|Register 3: minus three balls 24.
024:16:28|T|CC|Roger. Minus three balls 24. And you can go ahead and proceed.
024:16:34|T|CMP|Okay. Proceeding at this time.
024:16:55|T|CC|11, Houston. After you've completed P52, we'd like to uplink you a new state vector so we can start out clean on this P23. Over.
024:17:07|T|CMP|Okay.
024:17:20|T|LMP|Houston, are you observing the higher O2 flow on fuel cell 3?
024:17:33|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It's triggered the MASTER ALARM three times, now. There goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4, then oscillates back down to about 1.1. Over.
024:17:47|T|CC|Roger. We saw them 1.3 now on TM. Stand by a second.
024:17:59|T|CMP|And we're in P00, now, for a state vector.
024:18:04|T|CC|Roger. Give us ACCEPT, please.
024:18:11|T|CMP|Roger. Done.
024:18:40|T|CC|11, Houston. On your O2 flow, fuel cell 3: apparently, it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate's acceptable. Over.
024:18:54|T|LMP|Roger, It seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also. Over.
024:19:03|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
024:19:49|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours; you can go back to BLOCK.
024:19:57|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
024:20:29|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
024:20:41|T|CDR|Houston, 11. I don't believe we were calling you right then.
024:20:47|T|CC|Roger. Out.
024:22:53|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 hours 22 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 102,436 nautical miles, velocity 5,288 feet per second.
024:23:52|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
024:23:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
024:24:00|T|CMP|Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star - what number is it? - star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?
024:24:21|T|CC|Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.
024:24:31|T|CMP|Okay.
024:24:34|T|CC|When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the sub-stellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to sub-stellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.
024:25:04|T|CMP|Yes. I believe.
024:25:06|T|CC|Roger. Over.
024:25:28|P|PAO|Star 37 is Nunki. Apollo 11 is now in Program 52 which is realignment of the platform prior to beginning the cislunar navigation operation.
024:29:23|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.
024:29:34|T|CC|That's certainly very sufficient.
024:29:39|T|CMP|Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a VERB 49 maneuver to your sub-stellar point. Okay?
024:29:51|T|CC|Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for the AUTO maneuver.
024:30:07|T|CMP|Okay.
024:30:15|T|CC|And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zeros?
024:30:21|T|CMP|Not yet.
024:30:22|T|CC|Okay.
024:30:52|T|CC|11, Houston. Over the past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure of CO2. Have you in fact changed the CO2 canister yet this morning? We don't need to do it right now; we'd just like to confirm it that our instrumentation is in good shape. Over.
024:31:12|T|CMP|No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.
024:31:19|T|CC|Okay. Then I guess you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.
024:31:32|T|CMP|All right.
024:31:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.
024:32:11|T|CC|Roger. We copy. And that is for star 01?
024:32:18|T|CMP|Star 01, right near the horizon. Code 110.
024:32:21|T|CC|Roger.
024:41:05|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver worked just fine. I am right at the sub-stellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.
024:41:19|T|CC|Roger. Is this for star 01?
024:41:23|T|CMP|That's correct.
024:41:30|T|CC|You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?
024:41:40|T|CMP|Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I've maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.
024:42:17|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.
024:42:47|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters?
024:42:54|T|CMP|Yes. I will be glad to. Shaft 331.2 and trunnion 35.85.
024:43:03|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
024:45:33|T|CMP|It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean. You could see all of North Africa, absolutely clear; all of Portugal, Spain, southern France; all of Italy, absolutely clear. Just a beautiful sight.
024:45:53|T|CC|Roger. We all envy you the view up there.
024:45:59|T|CMP|But still no star.
024:47:17|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
024:47:22|T|CMP|Roger. Go ahead, Bruce.
024:47:23|T|CC|Roger. On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the Flight Plan. Roll 177.2, pitch 298.2 and yaw 330.0. Over.
024:48:03|T|CMP|Okay. Fine. Let ts try that.
024:53:57|T|LMP|... gimbal lock ...
025:06:53|T|CC|11, this is Houston. While you're maneuvering here, could we get a LM/CM DELTA-P reading from you? Over.
025:07:01|T|CMP|Roger. Just a tad under 1, Bruce, 0.95.
025:07:05|T|CC|Roger. 0.95.
025:07:35|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That reading was the difference in pressure between the Lunar Module cabin and the Command Module cabin.
025:11:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
025:11:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
025:11:19|T|CC|Is the Commander aboard?
025:11:23|P|PAO|This is Jim Lovell calling Apollo 11.
025:11:35|T|CDR|Roger, the Commander's aboard.
025:11:38|T|CC|I was a little worried. This is the backup Commander still standing by. You haven't given me the word yet. Are you GO?
025:11:48|T|CDR|You've lost your chance to take this one, Jim.
025:11:51|T|CC|Okay. I concede.
025:13:36|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
025:13:39|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
025:13:41|T|CMP|Okay. Our maneuver is complete, and at this attitude the M-line is exactly 90 degrees out of phase. It is exactly pointed along the vector toward the center of the Earth instead of being parallel to the right.
025:13:57|T|CC|Roger.
025:14:14|T|CMP|I'm going to hold right here for your next suggestion.
025:14:19|T|CC|Roger.
025:18:18|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. It appears to be okay now; We've changed our attitude slightly, and I have a star and I'm maneuvering to get the M-line parallel.
025:18:29|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. We copy.
025:20:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 20 minutes. Apollo 11 -
025:20:27|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You - Stand by one.
025:21:07|P|PAO|Distance is now 103,263 nautical miles. Velocity 5,256 feet per second.
025:21:53|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Belay that last announcement. Those figures are not based on the proper Ground Elapsed Time. This display is static. We don't have the present numbers.
025:36:06|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you copying these NOUN 49's? I've been going through them fairly swiftly.
025:36:12|T|CC|Yes. We surely are. Let's see: plus 0.1 and a plus 0.2 on nautical miles and feet per second. Over.
025:36:22|T|CMP|Roger.
025:43:43|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
025:43:53|T|CMP|Go ahead.
025:43:54|T|CC|Yes, Mike. We show you in VERB 59 right now. Over.
025:44:04|T|CMP|That's right. I - I haven't entered - I gave the - I gave it back to the computer for a second. I put the mode switch from MANUAL back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight. So the delay here has been in going back to MANUAL and finding the star again, which I've finally done. And - Just a second here, I'll go to ENTER and get a 51 and mark on it. As I say, for some reason the computer drove the star off out of sight.
025:44:34|T|CC|Okay. Roger. Out.
025:48:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
025:48:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
025:48:18|T|CC|Roger. We show you with a little less than an hour to the mid-course correction number 2 burn. We recommend that you terminate the P23 activities here and press on with a wastewater dump, which we need from you, and get it ready for the burn. Over.
025:48:39|T|LMP|Okay.
025:48:43|T|CC|And I have your mid-course correction number 2 PAD when you're ready to copy.
025:48:50|T|LMP|Stand by.
025:49:14|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, ready to copy MCC 2.
025:49:21|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Mid-course correction number 2. SPS/G&N 63059, plus 097, minus 020, GET ignition 02644 5792, plus 00118, minus 00003, plus 00177, roll 277 355 015, NOUN 44 BLOCK is NA, DELTA-VT 00213 003 00168, sextant star 30 2082 370. The rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align: Vega and Deneb. Roll align 007 144 068. No ullage. LM weight: 33302. And, for your information, your heads will be pointed roughly towards the Earth on this burn. Read back. Over.
025:51:13|T|LMP|Roger. Mid-course correction number 2. SPS/G&N: 63059, plus 097, minus 020 02644 5792, plus 00118, minus 00003, plus 00177 277 - Are you still copying, Houston? Over.
025:51:45|T|CC|Roger. Still copying. Go ahead.
025:52:01|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is - Apollo 11, this is Houston. I copied your transmission about roll 277, and go ahead from roll 277. Over.
025:52:16|T|LMP|Roger. 355 015, NA, 00213 003 00168 30 2082 370. Vega and Deneb 007 144 068. No ullage. LM weight: 33302. Heads towards the Earth. Over.
025:52:46|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
025:54:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
025:54:06|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
025:54:08|T|CC|Roger. We'd like you to terminate battery A charge at GET 26 hours and re-initiate battery A charge after mid-course correction 2. Over.
025:54:22|T|LMP|Apollo 11. Roger.
025:54:24|T|CC|Roger. Out.
025:58:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 58 minutes. Apollo 11's distance is now 107,224 nautical miles. Velocity 5,106 feet per second.
025:59:36|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
025:59:40|T|LMP|Go ahead.
025:59:42|T|CC|Roger. If you can give us ACCEPT, we'll send you up a state vector and a target load for the maneuver.
025:59:51|T|LMP|Okay. Give us 1 minute to check the P23 damage.
025:59:56|T|CC|Sure thing.
026:00:30|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The DSKY's yours.
026:00:33|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
026:00:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours. The ignition time for this mid-course correction will be 26 hours, 44 minutes, 57 seconds - about 44 minutes from now. It will be a service propulsion maneuver. Duration of the burn will be 3 seconds, the delta-V 21.3 feet per second.
026:03:00|P|PAO|This mid-course maneuver should reduce the pericynthion of Apollo 11's trajectory from the present 175 nautical miles to 60 nautical miles.
026:03:47|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.
026:03:53|T|LMP|Thank you.
026:07:15|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
026:07:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
026:07:23|T|LMP|Roger. Wonder if you have a star that might be a little closer to the direction we're burning than the one you gave us.
026:07:31|T|CC|Roger. We're going to rework the attitude in the sextant star for you in order to improve the high-gain antenna coverage, and we'll have that for you in a few seconds.
026:07:44|T|LMP|Fine. We're already maneuvering ...
026:07:48|T|CC|Roger.
026:08:01|T|LMP|Maybe you can make it just the change in roll. Apollo 11, Over.
026:08:07|T|CC|Roger.
026:08:44|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
026:08:48|T|LMP|Go ahead.
026:08:50|T|CC|Roger. On your attitude for the burn: we'd like you to use roll 096, pitch 356, yaw 018. And, that will give you a sextant star of 01, shaft 253.8, trunnion 24.2. Over.
026:09:32|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Roger ... 356 ... 018 ...
026:09:49|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We are having difficulty reading you through the noise. Could you read back again, please? Over.
026:10:04|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Do you copy?
026:10:09|T|CC|Roger. Very weakly in the noise, but I think I can copy. Go ahead.
026:10:17|T|LCMP|Okay. Roll 096 356 018. Star 01 ... Over.
026:10:36|T|CC|Roger. I got all of that except trunnion. It's trunnion 242. Over.
026:12:18|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read me now on OMNI A?
026:12:21|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear, 11.
026:12:24|T|CMP|Okay. We'll stay on OMNI A for a while, then.
026:12:27|T|CC|Okay. I got all your readback except the value for trunnion. And, if it's 242, confirm, please.
026:12:35|T|LMP|Roger. 242.
026:12:37|T|CC|Okay.
026:25:39|P|PAO|The Guidance Officer reports Apollo 11 is now in the attitude for the mid-course correction.
026:27:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours, 27 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now 108,594 nautical miles. Velocity 5,057 feet per second. We're about 17 and a half minutes away from the mid-course correction.
026:38:28|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a couple of high-gain antenna angles, please?
026:38:34|T|CC|Roger. Stand by, 11.
026:38:44|T|CC|Roger, 11. Pitch minus 35, yaw 0. Over.
026:38:50|T|CMP|Thank you.
026:39:22|T|CC|Okay.
026:39:24|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read high-gain?
026:39:27|T|CC|Read you loud and clear on high-gain down here, and everything's looking good from our standpoint for your burn. Over.
026:39:35|T|CMP|Okay, Bruce.
026:40:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours and 40 minutes. We're just under 4 minutes to the mid-course correction maneuver. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 109,245 nautical miles. Its velocity is 5,033 feet per second. Spacecraft weight 96,361 pounds.
026:43:58|P|PAO|One minute to the burn.
026:44:22|P|PAO|The duration will be 3 seconds.
026:45:05|P|PAO|Burning.
026:45:08|P|PAO|Shutdown.
026:45:36|T|CDR|Houston, burn complete. Are you copying our residuals?
026:45:38|T|CC|That's affirmative.
026:45:59|T|CDR|And, Houston, looked like we saw about 87 or 88 psi on chamber pressure that time. I'd like you to look at that on the ground.
026:46:11|T|CC|Roger, 11. We'll take a look at that and get back in a few minutes.
026:46:26|T|CC|11, Houston. On our real-time telemetry we saw 95 to 97 psi on chamber pressure. We'll - We will look at the recordings down here, thought, and get back with you again. Over.
026:46:41|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
026:46:48|T|CC|And we've copied your residuals, 11.
026:46:53|T|CMP|Roger. No, we're not going to trim those ...
026:47:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That was a good burn. The residuals are on the order of a half a foot a second or less, and will not be trimmed.
026:48:41|P|PAO|We're showing spacecraft weight now as 96,159 pounds.
026:49:50|T|CC|11, Houston. Could we get your DELTA-V counter reading, please, from this burn?
026:49:58|T|LMP|That's minus 3.8.
026:50:01|T|CC|Minus 2.8?
026:50:04|T|LMP|3.8.
026:50:06|T|CC|Roger. Copy minus 3.8.
026:51:02|T|CDR|Houston, is there anything else you need on the burn status report?
026:51:14|T|CC|This is Houston. Negative, 11.
026:51:21|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
026:54:40|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
026:54:44|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
026:54:46|T|CC|Roger. I just wanted to remind you that we haven't noticed on the TM the VERB 66 after the burn. And for your information, we played the recorded TV back last night, I believe, after you all turned in for your rest period, and the pictures came out quite well. Over.
026:55:09|T|CMP|Did you get any usable pictures out of MILA on that first pass?
026:55:14|T|CC|Not that we've seen. We had word on the voice loop that MILA reported that they had gotten a minute's worth of TV signal, and Goldstone reported that they had gotten about a minute's worth of modulation but that they weren't able to get anything off of it.
026:55:34|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks.
026:55:39|T|CC|Okay. We have another input here, 11, that the MILA data was recognizable as a picture, but we don't have any evaluation as to the quality of the picture. Over.
026:55:52|T|CMP|Okay.
026:55:54|T|CC|And for our information, we've been watching a PC O2 again. Did you change a lithium hydroxide canister this morning? Over.
026:56:07|T|CDR|Yes. We did, and we've been seeing 1.7 percent in the spacecraft ever since.
026:56:13|T|CC|Roger. That agrees with our data.
026:56:18|T|CDR|1.7 millimeters.
026:56:20|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
026:56:59|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to PTC attitude.
026:57:04|T|CC|Roger.
026:59:20|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
026:59:25|T|LMP|Go ahead.
026:59:26|T|CC|Roger. From a propellant-balancing standpoint, we recommend that you use quads Alfa and Bravo to start the PTC maneuvers. Over.
026:59:38|T|LMP|Roger. Understand Alfa and Bravo.
026:59:40|T|CC|Roger. Out.
027:00:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours, Apollo 11's distance now 110,198 nautical miles. Velocity 4,984 feet per second.
027:06:12|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
027:06:18|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
027:06:19|T|CC|Roger. For CRYO-balancing purposes, we'd like you to turn the heater and oxygen tank number 1 off at this time. Over.
027:06:32|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
027:06:33|T|CC|Everything else in the CRYO system remains the same.
027:06:38|T|CMP|Okay.
027:06:54|T|CMP|Okay. We have O2 heater tank 1 off.
027:06:57|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
027:07:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours, 7 minutes. The crew is now is the process -
027:07:08|T|CMP|How is EECOMM today? Is he happy with all those good things?
027:07:12|T|CC|Oh, EECOMM is happy, and after you get PTC set up, we've got a little procedure from EECOMM here to check out the O2 flow and the O2 flow sensor in your cabin enrichment. Over.
027:07:27|T|CMP|Okay.
027:07:34|T|CMP|It'll be a while, Bruce. We're just now arriving in PTC attitude, and we're going to our 20 minutes of monitoring thruster activity.
027:07:42|T|CC|Roger. We copy. - still be here.
027:10:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Passive Thermal Control being reestablished by Apollo 11 is at the rate of three-tenths of a degree per second which would be three rotations per hour.
027:13:01|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you going to take control of the OMNI's now and switch us between B and D?
027:13:07|T|CC|This is Houston. Stand by one.
027:13:34|T|CC|11, Houston.
027:13:38|T|CMP|Go ahead.
027:13:39|T|CC|Mike, how about selecting Bravo at this time, and I'll give you a COMP configuration here, shortly.
027:13:47|T|CMP|Okay.
027:14:22|T|CMP|That PTC sure worked well last night.
027:14:26|T|CC|Outstanding.
027:14:54|T|CC|11, Houston.
027:14:58|T|CMP|Go ahead.
027:15:00|T|CC|Okay. Roll for the COMM situation: have S-band antenna OMNI A in Bravo, S-band antenna OMNI to OMNI, high-gain track to MANUAL, and the pitch is minus 50 and yaw is 270.
027:15:24|T|CMP|You may have to repeat some of that, James. We've got a LM guy taking care of the high-gain right now.
027:15:29|T|LMP|Yes, and he is eyeballing the Earth.
027:15:31|T|CMP|He's got his head out the window.
027:15:34|T|CC|I understand, I had trouble on 12 with him, too.
027:15:41|T|LMP|Say again what you'd like.
027:15:43|T|CC|Okay, The S-band antenna OMNI A switch to Bravo which you have now, and S-band antenna OMNI to the OMNI position, and the high-gain track to the MANUAL position -
027:15:58|T|LMP|Manual.
027:15:59|T|CC| - and the pitch and yaw angles are minus 50 for pitch and yaw is 270.
027:16:08|T|LMP|Minus 50 and 270.
027:16:28|P|PAO|That's Jim Lovell, the Commander of the backup of Apollo 11 crew communicating with Apollo 11 at the present time. He also commanded the Gemini 12 flight in which Buzz Aldrin was his pilot.
027:17:06|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, I'm looking through the monocular now, and to coin an expression, the expression that the view is just out of this world. I can see all the islands in the Mediterranean. Some larger and smaller islands of Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica. A little haze over the upper Italian peninsula, some cumulus clouds out over Greece. The Sun is setting on the eastern Mediterranean now. And, the British Isles are definitely greener in color than the brownish green that we have in the islands, in the peninsula of Spain. Over.
027:18:01|T|CC|Roger. I understand that the Northern Africa - Mediterranean area is fairly clear today, huh?
027:18:10|T|LMP|Right.
027:18:13|T|CMP|Yes. We see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down, too.
027:18:18|T|CC|Do you find that the monocular is any good to you, Buzz?
027:18:26|T|LMP|Yes, It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. Of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.
027:18:53|T|LMP|Got an anticyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of Brazil, and some - Well, the diameter of it must be over 2000 miles across.
027:19:14|T|CC|How does the weather look up in the southern part of the western hemisphere, or up in the United States area?
027:19:24|T|LMP|Well, you all are just beginning to come over the limb now. I can see parts of Central America, and it looks to be fairly - fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now, and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon. Over.
027:20:15|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
027:20:23|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin giving the description of what he could see on the Earth. The backup Lunar Module Pilot Fred Hayes is also in the Control Center at the present time.
027:21:49|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
027:21:51|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
027:21:54|T|LMP|I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.
027:22:40|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.
027:22:55|T|LMP|Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?
027:22:59|T|CC|(Laughing) A lot of gray paint.
027:25:27|T|CC|11, Houston.
027:25:33|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
027:25:35|T|CC|Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?
027:25:43|T|CMP|Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. I'm still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that sub-stellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.
027:26:08|T|CC|How about the - -
027:26:09|T|LMP|... correction on that last ...
027:26:13|T|CC|How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy?
027:26:19|T|CMP|Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.
027:26:56|T|LMP|Hey, Jim.
027:26:58|T|CC|Go ahead, Buzz.
027:27:01|T|LMP|Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.
027:27:24|T|CC|Sounds good.
027:27:45|T|CC|How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?
027:27:51|T|LMP|Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.
027:28:03|T|CC|It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.
027:28:04|T|CMP|... kept me busy, I'm ...
027:28:08|T|CMP|Say again about the last -
027:28:09|T|LMP|Yes. It sure is nice in here.
027:28:12|T|CC|I said it's a lot bigger than the last vehicle that Buzz and I were in.
027:28:16|T|CMP|Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.
027:28:30|T|CC|It was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the NAV station.
027:28:41|T|CDR|Everything is right next to everything in this vehicle.
027:28:47|T|LMP|Not where the waste management is concerned.
027:28:52|T|CDR|Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine through - throughout yesterday and last night, during the PTC, it cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.
027:29:28|T|CC|I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the walls?
027:29:39|T|CDR|No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.
027:29:48|T|LMP|One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one ounce, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.
027:30:13|T|CMP|Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a back-pressure problem. If the thing sees any back-pressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.
027:30:49|T|CC|Understand.
027:30:53|T|LMP|In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the gun, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.
027:31:04|T|CC|Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?
027:31:11|T|LMP|Yes. It seems reasonably warm.
027:31:15|T|CMP|We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.
027:31:47|T|CMP|Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now. How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?
027:31:55|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
027:31:59|T|CC|We're all set to go, Mike.
027:32:02|T|CMP|Okay. I'll press on then.
027:35:58|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. PTC has started and it looks good.
027:36:05|T|CC|11, Roger. This is Houston. Roger. Out.
027:46:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours 46 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is now 112,386 nautical miles, velocity 4,906 feet per second. We now have the actual numbers on the mid-course correction maneuver. Ignition time was 26 hours 44 minutes 57.92 seconds. Duration of the burn was 2.91 seconds. DELTA-V 20.9 feet per second.
027:47:21|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
027:47:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
027:47:27|T|CC|Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O2 flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.
027:47:46|T|CDR|Stand by.
027:48:36|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.
027:48:39|T|CC|Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O2 flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.
027:49:36|T|CDR|Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.
027:49:59|T|CC|Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.
027:50:13|T|CDR|Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.
027:50:18|T|CC|Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O2 flow on telemetry down here.
027:52:48|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.
027:52:55|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Say again, please.
027:52:59|T|CDR|You do have the O2 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.
027:53:06|T|CC|Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.
027:53:11|T|CDR|That's affirm. It's in DUMP.
027:53:15|T|CC|Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O2 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.
027:53:35|T|CDR|Roger.
028:07:12|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
028:07:15|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
028:07:19|T|CMP|Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly, but - The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.
028:07:54|T|CC|Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.
028:07:59|T|CMP|Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We're rotating around where it's going out of view again.
028:08:07|P|PAO|That's Mike Collins talking.
028:08:08|T|LMP|I'm waiting to pick it up in the sextant.
028:08:13|T|CC|Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants.
028:08:56|P|PAO|And Bruce McCandless is back on the Capcom console now,
028:30:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
028:36:08|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you need some help keeping OMNI's locked on us?
028:36:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.
028:36:37|T|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
028:36:39|T|CC|Okay. One thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your LM/CM DELTA-P reading for about 28 hours GET. Over.
028:37:05|T|LMP|Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.
028:37:10|T|CC|Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O2 flow on your onboard gage? Over.
028:37:22|T|LMP|Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading off-scale-low. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.
028:37:50|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.
028:38:42|T|CC|And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.
028:39:05|T|LMP|Good to hear it.
028:39:07|T|CC|Roger. We thought you'd feel that way about it.
028:39:20|T|LMP|We're right in the middle of - well either ... drink, or salmon salad, or something like that. That's probably why we're not answering you right away.
028:39:31|T|CC|Okay. Well, we don't want - -
028:39:32|T|CMP|My compliments to the chef, that salad salmon is outstanding.
028:39:40|T|CC|Roger. Understand that's the salad salmon. Over.
028:39:48|T|CMP|Something like that, salmon salad.
028:39:50|T|CC|There we go, okay, the salmon salad, very good.
028:39:55|T|LMP|Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.
028:40:29|T|CC|Roger, We're copying that.
028:40:56|P|PAO|At 28 hours 40 minutes, we're showing Apollo 11's distance as 114,922 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 4,819 feet per second. The crew is eating lunch at the present time, and it sounds like there's some music in the background that they are enjoying during their lunch period.
028:41:25|T|CC|11, Houston.
028:41:29|T|CDR|Go ahead.
028:41:31|T|CC|Roger. On that O2 flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.
028:42:03|T|LMP|Okay. It's a tight fix then.
028:42:05|T|CMP|We run a tight ship.
028:42:08|T|CC|(laughter) Roger. Is that music I hear in the background?
028:42:15|T|CMP|Buzz in singing.
028:42:16|T|CC|Okay.
028:42:29|T|CMP|Pass me the sausage, man.
029:00:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is now 115,837 nautical miles, velocity 4,788 feet per second. Spacecraft weight 96,117 pounds.
029:20:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours, 20 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is now 116,747 nautical miles, velocity 4,758 feet per second. One of the clocks in the Control Center is now displaying the time to landing, the landing timing based on the time in the Flight Plan. It shows we're 73 hours, 26 minutes, 30 seconds from the lunar landing.
029:32:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
029:32:13|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
029:32:14|T|CC|Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. Over.
029:32:55|T|LMP|Okay. What do you recommend?
029:32:58|T|CC|Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.
029:33:20|T|LMP|Roger. I understand.
029:33:21|T|CC|Okay.
029:33:38|T|CDR|And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?
029:33:59|T|CC|Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.
029:34:08|T|CDR|Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't very far west of you.
029:34:17|T|CC|Okay.
029:34:20|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
029:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours 40 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth 117,682 nautical miles, velocity 4,726 feet per second.
029:58:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
029:58:21|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
029:58:23|T|CC|11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, why, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.
029:59:28|T|CDR|Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?
029:59:44|T|CC|Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.
030:00:09|T|CDR|Okay. We understand. Thank you.
030:00:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 30 hours into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from Earth (sic) is 105,853 nautical miles, velocity 4,233 feet per second.
030:01:15|P|PAO|And that was Neil Armstrong - conducted a conversation with Capcom Bruce McCandless on the O2 flow rate transducer.
030:03:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a correction on those last distances and velocities. That distance and velocity is in reference to the Moon instead of the Earth. To the Moon - Apollo 11's distance from the Moon is 105,729 nautical miles at the present time and the velocity in reference to the Moon is 4,230 feet per second.
030:12:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like you to terminate charging on battery A at GET 30 plus 15. Over.
030:12:30|T|CDR|Okay. 30 plus 15 for battery A charge terminate.
030:12:36|T|CC|Roger. Out.
030:13:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 119,116 nautical miles. Its Earth referenced inertial velocity, 4,679 feet per second.
030:14:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on the present trajectory, Apollo 11 will enter the lunar sphere of influence as an elapsed time of 61 hours, 39 minutes, 58 seconds.
030:15:33|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
030:15:41|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
030:15:42|T|CC|Roger. If you're free for a minute, I've got some updates to the P37 PAD's that we passed up to you yesterday afternoon, I guess. As a result of doing mid-course correction number 2, the DELTA-V required in the TLI plus 35, 44, and 53 PAD's have changed slightly. Over.
030:16:17|T|LMP|Roger. Standing by to copy.
030:16:21|T|CC|Okay. TLI plus 35 PAD: the DELTA-VT should be 7992 instead of 8016. TLI plus 44 - It should be 6112 instead of 6141. And TLI plus 53 - It should be 8172 instead of 8209. Read back. Over.
030:16:57|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. 7992, 6112, 8172. Over.
030:17:05|T|CC|Roger. Readback correct. Out.
030:29:22|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Goldstone reports they are receiving TV from the spacecraft and are recording it.
030:29:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
030:29:34|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
030:29:38|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Goldstone reports they are receiving a TV picture coming down from you all, a little snowy, but a good TV picture. Over.
030:29:54|T|CDR|Roger. We're just testing the equipment up here.
030:29:59|T|CC|Roger.
030:30:03|T|LMP|Ask them if they can read the numbers.
030:30:07|T|CC|Okay. Stand by.
030:30:24|T|CC|Goldstone, this is Houston Capcom. Over.
030:30:41|T|CT|Houston Capcom, Goldstone M&O. Go ahead.
030:30:45|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a minute, Goldstone.
030:30:51|T|CC|11, this is Houston. What numbers are you referring to? Over.
030:31:00|T|LMP|Well, I guess if they can't see any numbers, why, it's kind of a lost cause.
030:31:04|T|CC|Negative. Standby. We wanted to know - -
030:31:06|T|LMP|...
030:31:07|T|CC|We wanted to know what numbers before we asked them.
030:31:12|T|LMP|Okay. I'm showing them the DSKY, and I'd like to know whether they can read what's showing on the DSKY, and also whether they can see P-R-O-G, V-E-R-B, and N-O-U-N. Over.
030:31:23|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a second.
030:31:26|T|CC|Goldstone M&O, Houston Capcom. Over.
030:31:29|T|CT|Capcom, Goldstone. Go ahead.
030:31:31|T|CC|Roger. Did you copy the spacecraft request?
030:31:34|T|CT|That's affirmative. I am reading the numbers on our monitor here.
030:31:38|T|CC|Okay, that's - standby - Roger. That's both the numbers on the DSKY itself, and the little words like PROGRAM and VERB, NOUN, COMPUTER ACTIVITY, things of this sort?
030:31:59|T|CT|Roger. I can read the numbers clearly. We can't distinguish what the words are, because it is a little snowy.
030:32:08|T|CC|Roger.
030:32:11|T|CT|Okay. I read VERB, NOUN, and PROGRAM.
030:32:19|T|CC|Roger. Do you see - Over in the left-hand corner, there's a big square one that says COMPUTER ACTIVITY, COMP ACTIVITY?
030:32:26|T|CT|Roger. I see a flash occasionally in that area.
030:32:28|T|CC|Roger. that's the one.
030:32:31|T|CT|Okay. It looks like he's moved the camera at this time.
030:32:34|T|CC|Roger.
030:32:36|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Goldstone M&O reports that they can read the numbers on the DSKY. They can also read VERB, NOUN, PROGRAM, and see the COMP ACTIVITY light flashing. Over.
030:32:49|T|LMP|Very good. Thank you.
030:32:51|T|CC|And they also report you appear to have panned the camera over to another location now.
030:32:58|T|LMP|Yes, we're going to work on something else.
030:33:01|T|CC|Roger.
030:33:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We do not have lines called up between here and Goldstone at the present time, so we cannot receive the pictures in Houston. Goldstone is recording. The lines will be up for the scheduled TV pass, approximately 6:30 this evening, Central Daylight Time.
030:33:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The tape from this unscheduled TV pass will probably be fed from Goldstone to Houston following the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening.
030:51:11|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
030:51:15|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
030:51:19|T|CMP|Oh, Charlie. That you?
030:51:21|T|CC|That's me. How are you there?
030:51:25|T|CMP|Oh, Just fine. How's the old White Team today?
030:51:27|T|CC|Oh, the old White Team's bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. We're ever alert down here.
030:51:34|T|CMP|Ever alert depends on - Hey, you got any medics down there watching heart rate? I'm trying to do some running in place down here, and I'm wondering just out of curiosity whether it brings my heart rate up.
030:51:45|T|CC|Well, they will spring into action here momentarily. Stand by.
030:52:13|T|CC|Hello, 11. We see your heart beating.
030:52:18|T|CMP|Okay, Well - look at the CDR's and the CMP's and see if they go up any. We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.
030:52:26|T|CC|I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.
030:52:32|T|CMP|I think Buzz is trying.
030:52:35|T|LMP|You got it.
030:52:36|T|CC|Okay. It's coming in at Goldstone, Buzz. As Bruce said, we don't have it here in the center.
030:52:59|T|LMP|I'm afraid this isn't going to help out the PTC very much.
030:53:06|T|CMP|Yes. I don't know if it's a vibration or what it is, but it makes the pitch and yaw rate needles on FDAI number 1 jump up and down a little bit where we jump up and down.
030:53:19|T|CC|Rog. Rog, Goldstone has said they see you running there, Mike.
030:53:29|T|CMP|Okay.
030:53:31|T|LMP|Ask him what he's running from.
030:53:48|T|CC|11, Houston. Mike, we see about a 96 heartbeat now.
030:53:56|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
030:54:28|T|CMP|Well, that's about all that is reasonable, without getting hot and sweaty.
030:54:32|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
030:58:00|T|CMP|Goldstone should be getting about the best picture of the Earth we can give them right now, Charlie.
030:58:04|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you much.
030:58:08|T|LMP|We've got a tittle distortion in the horizontal direction from banding on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing?
030:58:17|T|CC|Stand by - Stand by, Buzz. I'll let you know.
030:58:29|T|LMP|I guess it would be more described as a waviness.
030:58:52|T|CC|Goldstone M&O, Houston Capcom.
030:58:58|T|CT|Goldstone M&O.
030:58:59|T|CC|Okay. The crew is complaining of some horizontal banding on their monitor. Do you all see that on the picture?
030:59:06|T|CT|Stand by.
030:59:14|T|LMP|They wouldn't see anything now. We don't have anything in focus, Charlie.
030:59:20|T|CC|Roger. He's checking on it. I'll see if they had it earlier. Stand by.
030:59:29|T|LMP|I guess when we're showing the DSKY or when we're showing the Earth might be the better time.
030:59:35|T|CC|Okay.
030:59:41|T|CT|Houston Capcom, Goldstone.
030:59:42|T|CC|Go ahead.
030:59:43|T|CT|Okay. Our TV people confirm they see this horizontal band.
030:59:47|T|CC|Okay.
030:59:51|T|CC|11, Houston. The Goldstone TV people also see the banding when - at the same time you all do. Over.
031:00:02|T|LMP|Okay. Would they call it a horizontal waviness, instead of banding, maybe?
031:00:07|T|CC|I'm not talking to them directly. Stand by, Buzz. Let me see how they describe it.
031:00:13|T|CC|Goldstone M&0, Houston Capcom. Could you put the TV guy on the loop, please?
031:00:20|T|CT|Capcom, Goldstone. Roger.
031:01:02|T|CT|Houston Capcom, Goldstone M&O NET 1.
031:01:05|T|CC|Go.
031:01:06|T|CT|The TV people do not have access to NET 1 in that area. Suggest we use NET 2 For that purpose.
031:01:10|T|CC|Okay. Going to NET 2.
031:02:04|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.
031:02:24|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.
031:02:31|T|CC|Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.
031:02:36|T|LMP|Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.
031:02:45|T|CC|Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.
031:03:30|T|CC|Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.
031:03:48|T|LMP|Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.
031:03:52|T|CC|Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.
031:05:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 5 minutes and here in Mission Control we're changing shifts at this time. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth and our Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Charlie Duke.
031:05:12|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. We'd like you to switch to OMNI Delta. Over.
031:05:24|T|LMP|Roger. Going to Delta.
031:05:26|T|CC|Roger.
031:06:01|P|PAO|Apollo 11, at this time, is 121,158 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 4,613 feet per second. We anticipate that the change-of-shift briefing will begin at about 4:00pm Central Daylight Time.
031:07:20|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to terminate the O2 purge if you have not done so already, and the TV camera people say that the lines are inherent in the camera, Buzz; and it's something that we expected. Over.
031:07:41|T|LMP|Roger. Understand about the camera. Say again about the O2 purge.
031:07:45|T|CC|Roger. We can terminate the O2 purge at this time. Over.
031:07:50|T|LMP|Oh, okay. Fine. Will do.
031:13:19|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please select OMNI Bravo onboard. Over.
031:13:26|T|CMP|Okay. Going to Bravo, Charlie.
031:13:28|T|CC|Roger.
031:13:33|T|CMP|How's everything going down there? You guys happy with the spacecraft systems?
031:13:37|T|CC|Roger. Affirmative. Everything's looking really good to us. Over.
031:13:44|T|CMP|Okay. Same here.
031:14:23|T|CMP|Charlie, how far out can you pick up TV off the OMNIs?
031:14:27|T|CC|Stand by.
031:14:47|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNIs on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.
031:15:02|T|CMP|Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high-gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.
031:15:21|T|CC|Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.
031:15:25|T|CMP|Okay.
031:18:48|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got some PIPA biases and general drift updates for you if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
031:19:02|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. Stand by one.
031:19:04|T|CC|Roger, 11. The - -
031:19:05|T|CMP|You've got it.
031:19:07|T|CC|Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYROs is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so we're just trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYROs and accelerometers.
031:19:33|T|CMP|Sounds good.
031:19:37|T|CC|The system really looks good to us.
031:19:42|T|CMP|Glad to hear it, Charlie.
031:20:31|T|CC|11, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK. We've got the load in.
031:20:38|T|CMP|Okay. Roger.
031:21:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 22 minutes. We're scheduled to begin the change-of-shift briefing shortly. During the briefing we will record any conversations with the crew and play those back following the briefing. At 31 hours, 22 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
031:22:25|T|CMP|Boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. Right now, Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he can with his arms reach - all five windows, He can reach down into - the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.
031:22:48|T|CC|Sounds like Plastic Man to me.
031:23:00|T|CMP|I'm hiding under the left-hand couch trying to stay out of his way.
031:23:04|T|CC|Be a good idea, Mike.
031:25:19|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You got a cloud over the Houston area right now?
031:25:23|T|CC|Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.
031:25:33|T|LMP|Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.
031:25:45|T|CC|Roger.
031:25:45|T|LMP|Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.
031:25:49|T|CC|Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.
031:25:59|T|LMP|That view through this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the cross hairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.
031:26:38|T|CC|Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.
031:26:45|T|CMP|The guys in the weather office at Patrick wanted a report on the tops but I guess all we can say is we're above them.
031:26:52|T|CC|Roger. We'll pass it on to METRO.
031:27:09|T|CC|11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.
031:27:25|T|LMP|Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.
031:27:38|T|CC|Roger.
032:21:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 21 minutes. During the change-of-shift Press Conference we had about 3 minutes of conversation with the crew. During that conversation, Buzz Aldrin reported on - what appeared to be a weather disturbance off Cuba and the Caribbean and we also had some descriptions from Aldrin on the view of Earth from the spacecraft's present position. We'll played that back for you now and then stand by for any further live conversation with the crew.
032:24:58|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.
032:25:16|T|LMP|Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.
032:25:23|T|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we've got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.
032:25:43|T|LMP|Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.
032:25:48|T|CC|Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. high-gain angles: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.
032:26:29|T|LMP|Roger. We copy roll 21 - 261, pitch 090, yaw 000, high-gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.
032:26:46|T|CC|That's affirmative.
032:27:01|T|CMP|Charlie, Apollo 11. I got a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?
032:27:46|T|CC|Sounds pretty good. Stand by one.
032:27:50|T|CMP|Sounds like it might save a little gas.
032:29:06|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. What page do you want in that revision? Over.
032:29:11|T|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-20. Over.
032:29:28|T|LMP|Okay, I have it.
032:29:32|T|CC|Roger, 11. Under column A on page F2-20, line 5, line 05, the new data is 01042; line 07, the new data is 00256. Skipping down to line 11, 00070; line 12 is 00042; line 13 is 77730. In column Bravo, lines 3, 4, and 5, which are blank, should be all zeros for line 3; line 4 is 20017; line 5 20616. Over.
032:31:11|T|LMP|Roger. Page F2-20, column Alfa: 05, 01042; 07, 00256; 11, I'll say again. 11, 00070; 12, 00042; 13, 77730. Column Bravo: 03, 00000; 04, 20017; 05, 20616. Over.
032:32:09|T|CC|Roger. Good readback, Buzz. And stand by, Mike, on the coming-out-of-the-PTC recommendation. Over.
032:32:18|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
032:33:06|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with a recommendation on exiting PTCM. Over.
032:33:13|T|CMP|Go ahead.
032:33:14|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.
032:33:37|T|CMP|Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.
032:33:44|T|CC|Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.
032:33:58|T|CMP|Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.
032:34:01|T|CC|Roger.
032:38:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 39 minutes. This is a relative quiet period in the Flight Plan. The crew will be getting the spacecraft set up for the Passive Thermal Control termination, and the Television transmission. Capcom Charlie Duke has just put in a call. We'll pick that up.
032:39:11|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with some more words on exiting PTC. Over.
032:39:18|T|CMP|Go ahead, Charlie.
032:39:20|T|CC|Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.
032:40:13|T|CMP|Sounds like a winner.
032:40:14|T|CC|Okay.
032:40:33|T|CMP|I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.
032:40:38|T|CC|You sound like you'd better protect it. It looks like just about anything that you do with that DSKY is going to collapse that deadband back down.
032:40:49|T|CMP|Understand.
032:43:13|T|CMP|Charlie, we just STABED to 261 degrees roll, and it looks like whoever figured it out did a good job. It's right there, dab-smack in the middle of window number 1.
032:43:23|T|CC|Sounds great.
032:46:00|T|CMP|Looks like Houston's still got a little smog over it, Charlie.
032:46:04|T|CC|We've got a constant overcast here in the room. We'll be right there. Stand by.
032:46:13|T|CMP|Of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states.
032:46:31|T|CC|11, Houston. Some of our guys just came in from outside and said it's pretty clear over the center here. It's cleared up completely. All the storms have moved on.
032:46:42|T|CMP|Okay, good.
032:49:16|T|CMP|Oh, yes, Charlie. I can see it through the sextant now, and I can see the coastline is clear. Those clouds are just inland a few miles.
032:49:25|T|CC|Okay. We copy.
032:49:49|T|CMP|Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.
032:50:03|T|CMP|California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.
032:50:18|T|CC|How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?
032:50:24|T|CMP|Yes. As usual.
032:50:27|T|CC|Roger. 
032:50:27|T|CMP|The ... - It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.
032:50:48|T|CC|Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.
032:50:57|T|CMP|I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.
032:51:03|T|CC|Hey, man. That's super.
032:51:06|T|CMP|These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.
032:51:47|T|CC|11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.
032:51:55|T|CMP|Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.
032:52:22|T|CC|Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Mike.
032:52:27|T|CMP|Right.
032:52:33|P|PAO|Mike Collins is sending us this description from about 126,000 miles from Earth.
032:52:38|T|CMP|How far out are we, Charlie?
032:52:41|T|CC|Stand by. I'll give it to you exactly. Looks like around 130,000, but stand by.
032:52:47|T|CMP|Okay.
032:53:15|T|CC|11, Houston. The exact range is 125,200 miles, and you're traveling 4,486 feet per second.
032:53:28|T|CMP|Pretty far and pretty slow. Just past halfway.
032:53:48|T|CMP|Hey, Charlie, what the latest on Luna 15?
032:53:53|T|CC|Say again, Buzz? Over.
032:53:57|T|LMP|Roger. What's the latest on Luna 15?
032:54:01|T|CC|Stand by. I'll get the straight story for you.
033:33:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 34 minutes. We've been advised that we are getting a television transmission from Goldstone at the present time. This is an unscheduled TV transmission apparently of the crew checking out their onboard system.
033:35:04|P|PAO|We have lost lock on the high-gain antenna at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 127,991 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4400 feet per second. The regularly scheduled time for the television transmission is 6:47pm Central Daylight Time, and we are anticipating that that transmission will occur as scheduled.
033:37:39|P|PAO|We're getting momentary lock-on. We seem to have a somewhat better picture now. Here's a call to the crew from Capcom Charlie Duke.
033:37:53|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
033:37:57|T|CMP|Go ahead, Charlie.
033:37:59|T|CC|Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.
033:38:26|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, Charlie.
033:38:28|T|CC|And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.
033:38:55|T|CMP|Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.
033:41:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 41 minutes. We are going to be standing by here in Mission Control for the possibility that the crew would want to transmit that television pass early. The scheduled time for it was 6:47 Central Daylight Time and about 15 minutes was scheduled. That would be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 34 hours and we will have the system set up here in Mission Control to receive and release television should the crew decide to send us the transmission early.
033:45:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 45 minutes and we do have a correction to the time given for the beginning of that TV nominally. The Flight Plan time is beginning at 34 hours to 34 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The previous conversion of that, that we gave you for Central Daylight Time was in error, it should be 6:32pm Central Daylight Time beginning, assuming we start as the Flight Plan nominally has a transmission listed at 34 hours Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 128,431 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off slowly, now reads 4,386 feet per second.
033:47:54|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.
033:48:00|T|CC|Roger.
033:48:05|P|PAO|You've heard that comment from the crew. They've stopped their Passive Thermal Control, they're starting up the TV and we'll be standing by for - for a picture.
033:52:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.
033:52:49|T|LMP|Roger, Charlie. Buzz here. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
033:52:53|T|CC|Roger. You are about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. Over.
033:53:06|T|LMP|Okay. I moved my mike around. How about now? Is this any better?
033:53:10|T|CC|Hey, that's beautiful right there. Thank you.
033:53:14|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?
033:53:18|T|CC|Roger. You're five-by. Is Neil on?
033:53:22|T|CDR|1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
033:53:25|T|CC|Roger, Neil. You're five-by.
033:57:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours 57 minutes and we are less than 3 minutes now from the scheduled television transmission. From Apollo 11, we're continuing to standby for that. We have also been asked to advised that the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10:00pm has been postponed for 24 hours. To repeat, the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10:00pm has been postponed for 24 hours. Further details on that will be available in the News Center.
033:59:08|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.
033:59:45|T|CC|Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.
033:59:52|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.
034:00:06|T|CC|Roger.
034:00:11|P|PAO|This view is coming to us from about 129,000 nautical miles.
034:01:16|T|CC|11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.
034:01:31|T|CDR|Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.
034:03:44|T|CC|Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud formations trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.
034:04:12|T|CDR|Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.
034:04:53|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloud band trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.
034:05:25|T|CDR|I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.
034:05:35|T|CC|Roger.
034:05:41|T|CC|You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.
034:06:09|T|CC|It appears that the - -
034:06:10|T|CDR|Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.
034:06:18|T|CC|Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.
034:06:31|T|CDR|Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast, although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer ranges.
034:07:03|T|CC|Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the Control Center. Over.
034:07:20|T|CMP|Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.
034:07:49|T|CC|11, that's a pretty good roll, there.
034:08:02|T|CMP|Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.
034:08:11|T|CC|You'll never beat out the thunderbirds.
034:08:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That practice did you some good. It's looking - real smooth roll, there.
034:08:42|T|CC|Oops! Spoke too soon.
034:08:52|T|CMP|I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.
034:08:57|T|CC|Roger.
034:09:01|T|CMP|You don't get to do that every day.
034:09:11|T|CC|11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloud-cap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.
034:09:46|T|LMP|Trying to fit everybody into the window.
034:09:49|T|CDR|It appears that the cloud-cap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.
034:10:02|T|CC|Roger.
034:10:10|T|CC|We've - 11, we've lost our picture here, now.
034:10:23|T|CC|Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.
034:10:35|T|CDR|Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.
034:10:46|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
034:10:50|T|CC|11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.
034:11:05|T|CDR|Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.
034:11:07|T|CC|Roger.
034:12:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.
034:12:45|T|CDR|That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.
034:12:50|T|CC|Roger.
034:12:56|T|CC|We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.
034:13:10|T|CMP|It's a floodlight.
034:13:11|T|CC|Roger.
034:13:14|T|CC|Now we're coming in. Can't quite make out who that ...
034:13:24|T|CC|That's big Mike Collins, there - -
034:13:25|T|CMP|You got a little bit of - Yes, hello there sports fans. You got a little bit of me, plus Neil is in the center couch, and Buzz is doing the camera work at this time.
034:13:34|T|CC|Roger. It's a little dark now, 11. Maybe a bigger f-stop might help.
034:13:44|T|CMP|Yes, that's in work.
034:14:05|T|CC|It's getting a lot better now, 11. Mike, you're coming in five-by. I got a good -
034:14:14|T|CMP|I would have put on a coat and tie if I'd known about this ahead of time.
034:14:18|T|CC|Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you? Over.
034:14:25|T|CMP|Cue cards have a no. We have no intention of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.
034:15:05|T|CC|Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - when you - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.
034:15:35|T|CMP|Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.
034:15:39|T|CC|Roger.
034:15:50|T|CMP|He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.
034:15:57|T|CC|Roger. We can see portions of the LEB now. The systems test meter panel, in the lower part of the picture, or we did have it, anyway.
034:16:09|T|CMP|Okay. And directly behind his head are our optical instruments, the sextant and the telescope that we use to take sightings with.
034:16:19|T|CC|Roger. Copy. And we see the DSKY flashing with a 651. In fact, we can read registers 1 and 2 quite clearly.
034:16:31|T|CMP|We have the old high-gain angles telling us which way the Earth is.
034:16:35|T|CC|Copy. That's a beautiful picture. Clarity is outstanding.
034:16:46|T|CMP|We can also give you the time of day in our system of Mission Elapsed Time. Elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. Can you see that clearly enough, Charlie?
034:16:59|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. We can see it counting up every - every second. We got 34:17:02 now.
034:17:13|T|CMP|Okay. Back to the high-gain angles.
034:17:15|T|CC|Roger.
034:17:18|T|CMP|Now we have amputated those.
034:17:45|T|CC|11, Houston. We have a beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around. ... That looks like the star charts coming into view, now. Over.
034:17:58|T|CMP|Yes. Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the right-hand window, window number 5.
034:18:06|T|CC|Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.
034:18:20|T|CMP|Roger. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. They're just for show.
034:18:27|T|CC|We copy.
034:18:28|T|LMP|While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will be in eclipsed - it will be eclipsing the Sun as we go behind it, as we approach the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver.
034:19:19|T|CC|Roger, 11. We've - Could you attempt a little bit better focus there, 11? Over.
034:20:01|T|CC|11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.
034:20:19|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie.
034:20:42|T|LMP|If we can get some of the wires untangled here, we'll give you a demonstration of how easy push-ups are up here.
034:20:52|T|CC|11, Roger. Good view of Buzz, there.
034:21:24|T|LMP|When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.
034:21:29|T|CC|Roger. We copy. We couldn't figure out whether that was a chin-up or a push-up. just take your choice, I guess.
034:22:05|T|CMP|Well, it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there, Earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.
034:22:14|T|CC|11, Roger.
034:22:38|T|CC|11, Houston. We see a box full of goodies there. Over.
034:22:43|T|CMP|We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, and beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.
034:23:04|T|CC|Roger.
034:23:10|T|CMP|Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew.
034:23:45|T|CC|Sounds delicious.
034:23:56|T|CMP|Yes. The food so far has been very good. We couldn't be happier with it.
034:24:00|T|CC|Roger.
034:24:01|T|CMP|Could I borrow that flashlight a second?
034:24:04|T|CC|The surgeons are saying thank you, there, for that.
034:24:09|T|CMP|And it is sort of down in a dark corner, so we have a flashlight here to help us see things; and if I can let go of it carefully, it'll just hold itself right where it is.
034:24:23|T|CC|Roger.
034:24:25|T|CMP|As long as ... disturbed it will.
034:24:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there, Mike. It's -
034:24:44|T|CMP|Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.
034:24:59|T|CC|It looks fairly stable now with slow rotation.
034:25:28|T|CMP|Well, so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.
034:25:33|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
034:25:38|T|LMP|Charlie, we checked out the cable lengths, and we're thinking we might want to see if we can take the TV into the LM with us tomorrow for part of the time. Over.
034:25:49|T|CC|Roger. Good show. We'd like to see it if it'll reach that far. Over.
034:25:57|T|LMP|We'll give it a try.
034:25:59|T|CC|Roger.
034:26:30|T|CMP|And where I sleep is down underneath this couch.
034:26:37|T|CC|Houston. Roger.
034:26:42|T|CC|Slowly sinking into the sack there.
034:26:51|T|CMP|It's really comfortable.
034:27:01|T|CMP|Forgot to give Buzz his flashlight back.
034:27:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give the folks a view of your patch if - on your CWGs? Over.
034:27:37|T|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie; we'll try and give you a closeup.
034:27:40|T|CC|Roger.
034:27:52|T|CC|11, Houston. We have the patch. Could you attempt to improve the focus slightly? Over.
034:28:13|T|CC|11, Houston. The scan on the camera makes the - that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker, due to the scan on the TV. We can't see the Eagle. Now it's a little bit better. Over. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Over.
034:28:41|T|CMP|It's open all the way. We're going to have to move Buzz around a little bit.
034:28:44|T|CC|Roger.
034:29:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The color's better now. It's coming in. We could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There we go; it focuses a lot better now. We see the Eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. Over. That's very good now.
034:29:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the Eagle coming in.
034:30:05|T|CMP|It's probably pretty hard to see the olive branch, isn't it?
034:30:07|T|CC|Roger. It is.
034:30:12|T|CMP|Well, that's what he has in his talons, is an olive branch.
034:30:16|T|CC|Copy.
034:30:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console, and we can see the DSKY up on the panel. Over.
034:31:32|T|CMP|That would be nice if you could take a look at all the circuit breakers; make sure the right ones are in and the right ones are out.
034:31:38|T|CC|Roger. Big Brother's watching.
034:31:43|T|CMP|And we're glad of it.
034:31:52|T|CMP|Boy, you guys have sure been doing a good job of watching us, Charlie. We appreciate it.
034:31:56|T|CC|The spacecraft's been beautiful, 11. We've really no complaints at all. Looks - Things are really great.
034:32:10|T|CMP|Can you see this DSKY on the MDC?
034:32:13|T|CC|That's affirmative. It appears that - can't quite tell what program - well, looks like we're in P00. We see you punching in a VERB 35, I think it is. Over.
034:32:28|T|CMP|Yes. Might as well tell the EECOMM's - or tell the GNC and everybody to hold on to their hat and I'll push the ENTER button.
034:32:36|T|CC|Roger.
034:32:41|T|CC|Roger. We see a real display now.
034:32:56|T|CC|That's a good demonstration of how the crew has the interface with the computer, talking to the programs and all, that we have in the computer.
034:33:09|T|CMP|Well, that's right, Charlie. Sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us.
034:34:14|T|CC|11, Houston, We just lost our pic - I see we're going back outside now. Over.
034:34:29|T|SC|...
034:34:31|T|CC|11, Houston. Do you copy? Over.
034:34:35|T|CDR|Roger. We copy, and as we pan back out to the distance at which we see the Earth, well, it's Apollo 11 signing off.
034:34:49|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Thank you much for the show. It's a real good half hour. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Out.
034:34:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo control. That TV transmission lasted about 35 minutes.
034:35:12|T|CMP|Okay. That's it, Charlie.
034:35:14|T|CC|11, Houston. We appreciate the show. Thank you very much. Over.
034:35:18|T|CMP|Right.
034:35:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you key ERROR RESET on the DSKY, please? Over.
034:35:49|T|CDR|Okay. We should be straightened out now, Charlie, and back in P00.
034:36:33|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do we stand on this O2 fuel cell purge? You want to go ahead and do that as scheduled in the Flight Plan?
034:36:41|T|CC|Stand by, 11. Over.
034:36:44|T|CMP|Okay.
034:36:48|T|CC|11, Houston. You can commence the O2 fuel cell purge now if you'd like. Over.
034:36:54|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
034:37:03|T|CMP|While Buzz is doing that, I'll change the lithium hydroxide.
034:37:06|T|CC|Roger.
034:41:33|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
034:41:37|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
034:41:39|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. The attitude that we're in right now is a convenient one to start PTC in. We'd be satisfied with this attitude. So we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta; and we'll wait about 5 to 10 minutes, and than we'll establish the PTC. Over.
034:42:00|T|LMP|Roger. Disable Charlie and Delta, and we'll wait before starting PTC.
034:42:06|T|CC|Roger.
034:44:21|T|KRANZ|Retro, you got your BLOCK data?
034:46:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 46 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4,300 feet per second. During the TV transmission the crew advised that they may possibly be able to take the color television camera into the Lunar Module with them tomorrow at about 56 hours, 30 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time. They reported that the cables had been checked and are appeared to be long enough to take them into the Lunar Module. During the next hour or so the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving on, getting the crew set up for their rest period and eat period. This will be a very long rest period tonight, scheduled 10 hours. That will begin according to the Flight Plan, at about 37 hours, Ground Elapsed Time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the Flight Plan, that perhaps again tonight we would be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early. At 34 hours, 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
034:53:17|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Over.
034:53:26|T|LMP|Okay. We'll get it going.
034:59:58|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
035:00:03|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
035:00:09|T|CMP|Roger. This time the DAP didn't like 0.3. It's - We followed the procedures; we got down to 70 000 ENTER. It took off at about 0.7.
035:00:21|T|CC|Roger. We're copying that. Stand by.
035:00:39|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like high-gain back?
035:00:43|T|CC|Roger. And you - Would you select ATTITUDE HOLD? Over.
035:01:09|T|CDR|Houston. Would you say again what your request is?
035:01:15|T|CC|Roger, 11. We'd like you to go back to ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.
035:01:22|T|CDR|Roger.
035:01:23|T|CC|11, Houston. Looks like we're going to have to reinitialate - reinitialize this PTC.
035:01:31|T|CDR|All right.
035:01:41|T|CMP|Okay. Do you have any roll angle that you'd like to stop it in, Charlie? I haven't stopped it yet.
035:01:48|T|CC|Stand by.
035:01:55|T|CC|11, Houston. It's your preference. Right now if you want to. Over.
035:02:02|T|CMP|Okay.
035:07:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
035:07:52|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
035:07:53|T|CC|Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in a number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to damp out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.
035:08:37|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good, Charlie. When you get to the VERB 49, I'd like for you to give me the three gimbal angles that you want loaded.
035:08:44|T|CC|Roger. We'll do. Over.
035:08:48|T|CMP|Thank you.
035:08:50|T|CC|And Apollo 11, Houston. We have your flyby PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
035:08:56|T|CMP|Stand by one.
035:09:31|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Is that P30 PAD?
035:09:33|T|CC|That's affirmative. Over.
035:09:41|T|LMP|Okay. Ready to copy.
035:09:42|T|CC|All right, Buzz. It's - flyby is the purpose. SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 097, minus 020 070 54 5944, minus 00028, plus 00023, plus 00069 029 149 312, apogee is NA, plus 00221 00078 001 00034, sextant star 01 2185 227, boresight star is NA; NA NA. Latitude is minus 0265, minus 16500, 11899 36228, 144 56 47. In the comments: your set stars are Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068. No ullage. It's a docked burn using the PTC REFSMMAT. Stand by for your readback. Over.
035:12:41|T|LMP|Okay. Would you give me GET of O.05g again, please?
035:12:48|T|CC|Roger. 144 56 47. Over.
035:12:58|T|LMP|Roger. Flyby SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 097, minus 020 070 54 5944, minus 00028, plus 00023, plus 00069, 269 149 312 NA, plus 00221 00078 001 00034, 01 2185 227 NA, minus 0265, minus 16500 11899 36228 144 56 47, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068. No ullage; docked, PTC REFSMMAT. Over.
035:13:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently about 93,265 nautical miles from the Moon and with respect to the Moon is traveling at a speed of about 4,019 feet per second. At this time we are receiving the tape play-back which Goldstone, the tracking site at Goldstone, California received from the spacecraft in that earlier unscheduled TV transmission. This was a test of the system using the spacecraft on the antennas, the small omni-directional antennas. Normally transmissions from this distance in space would be - would require the high-gain antenna. This television transmission is being processed and converted to color and we anticipate that we'll have it available for playback at about 9:00pm. We are in conversation with the spacecraft at this time. We'll pick up the tape recorded conversation that we have and then stand by to follow any live conversation.
035:14:12|T|CC|Roger. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. I copy - I read 029. Over.
035:14:21|T|LMP|Roger. 029.
035:14:22|T|CC|Roger. Good readback.
035:14:38|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. On the 0.7 rate, the rate loaded into the DAP is 0.1 or 0.2.
035:14:48|T|CC|11, Roger.
035:17:46|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
035:17:51|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go.
035:17:53|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Would you please copy down your VERB 16, NOUN 20 ICDU angles now, then execute a VERB 49 and load that - those angles, the NOUN 20 that you see on the DSKY into the VERB - into the NOUN 22 slot; and PRO on that, and that will start our 20-minute rate period. Over.
035:18:19|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll do that right now in just a matter of interest. Those numbers are plus 04511, plus 09021, and plus 35984. Over.
035:18:32|T|CC|Roger.
035:20:13|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I've done that and, of course, I got an immediate 50 18. So I guess we're set up to proceed from here, and I'll start the 20-minute timer.
035:20:20|T|CC|That's affirmative.
035:20:44|T|CMP|Houston. I still question that 0.7 rate with 0.2 loaded into the DAP, though. Could you explain that one?
035:20:50|T|CC|Roger. We're working on it. Standby one.
035:20:54|T|CMP|Okay.
035:25:42|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
035:25:47|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
035:25:49|T|CC|Roger. We got a little laser visual experiment we'd like to - for you to do for us. If - if you got the Earth through any of your windows or through the telescope, would you so advise? Over.
035:26:08|T|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie.
035:26:14|T|CMP|At this roll attitude, what should our high-gain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see you in the lens.
035:26:23|T|CC|Stand by.
035:27:26|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Those high-gain angles are pitch minus 70, yaw 90. We think the Earth is apparently pretty close to plus z-axis. Over.
035:27:39|T|CMP|Okay.
035:27:59|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope.
035:28:07|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. We've got a laser that we're going to - It's a blue-green laser that we're going to flash on and off at a frequency of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of McDonald Observatory near El Paso, which is - should be right on the terminator - or right inside the terminator. We are going to activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see if you can see it. Over.
035:28:41|T|CMP|Telescope? Or sextant?
035:28:45|T|CC|Either one. Over.
035:28:48|T|CMP|Okay, I'll try it with the telescope; and if I don't see it there, then I'll try the sextant.
035:28:53|T|CC|Roger. We'll give you the word when they've got it turned on. Over.
035:28:58|T|CMP|Okay.
035:29:44|T|CC|11, Houston. They don't have it turned on yet. We'll give you the word when they got it turned on. Over.
035:29:50|T|CMP|Okay.
035:30:42|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We noticed the CRYO pressure dropped a moment ago. Did you stir up the CRYO's? Over.
035:30:49|T|LMP|Roger. We've finished our cycling operations.
035:30:52|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.
035:33:52|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. McDonald's got the laser turned on, Would you take a look? Over.
035:34:02|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie.
035:34:04|T|CC|It's bluish-green.
035:36:48|T|CC|11, Houston. We got some shaft and trunnion for you that might tweak it up a little bit. Shaft of 141.5, trunnion of 39.5. Over.
035:37:06|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
035:38:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If you see it, it should be coming up - appear to be coming up, through the clouds. McDonald reports that there's a break in the clouds that they're beaming this thing through. Over.
035:39:08|T|CDR|Roger.
035:39:54|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the exercise on the Laser. Our rates are steady enough now for - to commence the PTC. Over.
035:40:06|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Neither Neil nor Mike can see it. Incidentally, those shafts and trunnions just missed pointing at the world.
035:40:17|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
035:40:26|T|LMP|As we are looking at it through the scanning telescope, it would be about a - oh, maybe a third of an Earth radii high and to the left.
035:40:37|T|CC|Roger.
035:40:39|T|LMP|But, we did - but we did identify the El Paso area and it appeared to us to be a break in the clouds there, and we looked in that break and saw nothing.
035:40:48|T|CC|Roger. Thank you much. Out.
035:43:06|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
035:43:08|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.
035:43:13|T|CMP|Were you following that on the DSKY?
035:43:17|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
035:43:27|T|CC|11, Houston. What's your exact question? Over.
035:43:34|T|CMP|I've followed the procedure through step 7 down to the point where I've got 27303 ENTER, and this resulted in an OPERATOR ERROR LIGHT.
035:43:47|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
035:45:04|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Stand by a moment. We'll have an answer for you momentarily. Over.
035:45:11|T|CMP|Okay. Appreciate it, Charlie. Now the light's gone out without any further DSKY action.
035:45:16|T|CC|Roger.
035:45:17|T|CMP|Correction. Stand by; that's not so.
035:45:22|T|CC|Roger.
035:57:06|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
035:57:11|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
035:57:13|T|CC|Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 50 18, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDUs, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.
035:58:04|T|CMP|Okay. I think that's what we did last time.
035:58:10|T|CC|It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDUs. Over.
035:58:26|T|CMP|Okay.
036:01:03|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're moving at the proper rate.
036:01:06|T|CC|Hallelujah!
036:01:52|T|CC|11, Houston. It looks great to us now. Over.
036:01:59|T|CMP|It looks fine here, Charlie. The 0.7 part is the only part I don't find explained yet.
036:02:06|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We're working on that one right now. We're coming up with the story soon. Over.
036:02:14|T|CMP|Thank you.
036:02:24|T|CC|11, Houston. We're handing over COMM to Goldstone. Over. Correction, from Goldstone to Honeysuckle. Over.
036:02:32|T|CMP|Okay.
036:02:53|T|CMP|Hello, Houston through Honeysuckle. Ov - -
036:03:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
036:03:05|T|CMP|You sound good to us through Honeysuckle. How do we sound?
036:03:08|T|CC|Roger. You're five-by, Mike. We'd like the OMNI configuration as follows. OMNI Alfa placed in Bravo, OMNI to OMNI, high-gain track to MANUAL, high-gain yaw 270, pitch - -
036:03:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At the present time we are handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California, to the site at Honeysuckle which accounts for the noise in the transmission -
036:04:02|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.
036:04:07|T|LMP|Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. I'm not sure I got all those. I've got S-band OMNI B, OMNI, track to MANUAL, and beam wide, pitch - you'd better say that again, and yaw 270. Over.
036:04:26|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. I broke up at pitch minus 50 at beam wide. Over.
036:04:37|T|LMP|Roger. Copy.
036:05:25|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy some numbers on status report, et cetera.
036:05:31|T|CC|Say again. Over.
036:05:38|T|LMP|Roger. Are you ready to copy some numbers on the status report, et cetera?
036:05:42|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.
036:05:49|T|LMP|Okay. Radiation CDR 11005, CMP 10006, LMP 09007; medication negative. And I got some battery and RCS numbers for you.
036:06:07|T|CC|Go ahead. Over.
036:06:11|T|LMP|Battery C 37.1, PYRO battery A and B both 37.1. RCS Alfa 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.
036:06:28|T|CC|Roger, we copy. Radiation 11005, 10006, 09007; no medication; 37.1, 37.1, 37.1, 82, 84, 85, 87. Over.
036:06:52|T|LMP|That's affirmative. And you want a LM/CM DELTA-V? It's 1.1.
036:06:57|T|CC|Roger. Copy 1.1.
036:07:57|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please verify the four CRYO heaters AUTO, the four fans off. Over.
036:08:08|T|LMP|Okay. We have been holding the O2 heater number 1 in the OFF position. I believe that was your last instruction. All the other heaters are AUTO and all fans are off. Over.
036:08:22|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
036:08:26|T|CC|11, Houston. We would like all heaters AUTO. Over.
036:08:32|T|LMP|Roger. All four AUTO, all four fans off.
036:09:00|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. As the Sun sinks slowly in the west, the White Team bids you good night. If we get a story on the seven-tenths, we can give it to you in about 15 minutes or so; if not, we'll give it to you in the morning. Over.
036:09:16|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds fine, Charlie. Thanks.
036:09:33|T|LMP|Hey, you earned your pay today, Charlie. Thank you.
036:09:39|T|CC|Roger. Good night all.
036:10:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours 11 minutes. At the present time Apollo 11 is 134,000 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity is 4,216 feet per second. During that last series of transmissions from the crew, we received a status report from Buzz Aldrin and he reported that the crew has, in the past 24 hours, taken no medication. This is similar to the crew status report we received from them last night. We bid them good night at 36 hours 9 minutes or about 2 minutes ago. We anticipate that the crew will probably have a few more housekeeping type chores aboard the spacecraft before they actually turn in and also we'll probably be combining their eat period with the first part of that sleep period. At 36 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control Houston.
036:20:05|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. One request: the optics switch to zero. And we're - got a lot of theories on why it maneuvered at seven-tenths a moment ago, Mike, but no real definite answer. We'll be back with you later. Over.
036:20:21|T|CMP|Okay. No rush, Charlie. Thank you.
036:27:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 27 minutes. We have completed the processing of the unscheduled television transmission which the crew sent down from the spacecraft at about 30 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this evening. I would like to repeat that this was an apparent test of the onboard system. The crew turned the television equipment on and left it on for about 52 minutes. Some of the time we will have a picture of the parts of it, we don't have good lock-on, and I will not have a good solid picture. We should also point out that this transmission was made with the OMNI directional antennas, which, of course, don't provide nearly the signal strength that we would get from the high-gain antenna, which would be used. We'll play back the tape of that transmission for you at this time.
036:52:06|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
036:52:10|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
036:52:12|T|CC|Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that 0.7 rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation, the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is, if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.
036:53:08|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
036:53:10|T|CC|Roger.
037:20:34|P|PAO|At this time Apollo 11 is 137,219 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4,132 feet per second. Here at Mission Control things have settled down into a rather quiet nighttime routine. We said goodnight to the crew about 36 hours - 36 hours 9 minutes to be exact, a little over a hour ago. We did hear from them once or twice since then and we anticipate that this time are probably getting settled down to begin their 10 hours sleep period. At 37 hours 21 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
038:26:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 38 hours 26 minutes. Here in Mission Control, we are presently going through the shift change. Flight Director, Glenn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers are coming on to replace Gene Kranz. The Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be astronaut Ron Evans. Flight Surgeon, John Ziegleschmidt reported that two of the 3 crewmen apparently began sleeping at about 38 hours Ground Elapsed Time or about 26 minutes ago, and the two that are asleep are Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins and Commander, Neil Armstrong. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin at last report was still awake. We expect the change-of-shift press briefing will occur at about 11:15 Central Daylight Time. At 38 hours 27 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
039:40:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 39 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew at this time all three soundly asleep. The space digitals display - stand by. The space digitals display here in Mission Control now showing 82,905 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity 3,897 feet per second relative to the Moon. Awake time 7 hours 19 minutes away. Spacecraft presently over the west-central Pacific, if a line were projected back toward its nearest point on Earth. And at 39 hours 41 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
040:58:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 40 hours 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently 146,300 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 3,917 feet per second. 6 hours, 1 minute remaining in the sleep period - the ten hour sleep period schedule in the Flight Plan. Rather quiet here during the night watch or the Black Team which tonight is being headed up by Flight Director, Jerry Griffin who is spelling the usual Black Team Flight Director, Gene (sic) Lunney. One clock here in Mission Control shows landing time 61 hours 48 minutes from now. This is similar to the entry clock which the - is used in the same position in the Control Room toward the end of a mission, will be refined continuously as we get down to the gnats hair of the exact second of landing. At 40 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.
042:28:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 42 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 11 still asleep at this time; some 4 hours 30 minutes remaining in the scheduled 10 hour sleep period. Altitude now, from the Moon 76,529 nautical miles. Velocity from the Moon - or toward the Moon, 3,842 feet per second relative to the Moon, that is.  And, at 42 hours, 28 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
043:29:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 43 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently on a spot directly above or directly out from the Malay Peninsula. Some 3 hours 30 minutes remaining in the scheduled 10 hour sleep period for the crew. And if the space digital display were up here at the time coming out of the computer we would know what the distance and velocity were. So, at 43 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
044:28:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 44 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew has another 2 hours, 31 minutes remaining in their 10 hour sleep period. The spacecraft is now some 72,010 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity continuing to decelerate as we get nearer the changeover point in influence between the Earth and the Moon. Velocity now showing 3,811 feet per second. The spacecraft now calculated to weigh 96,068 pounds. At 44 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
045:28:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 45 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A little more than an hour remaining in the Apollo 11 crew sleep period. Present velocity, 3,799 feet per second. Distance from Moon, 69,810 nautical miles. Apollo 11 will continue decelerating as it gets to the point where the Moon's sphere of influence overcomes the Earth's sphere of influence. This point will take place - This event will take place at 61 hours 39 minutes and 57 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, according to the Flight Dynamics Officer. At this point, the spacecraft-to-Moon distance will be 33,822 nautical miles, spacecraft-to-Earth distance, 186,437 nautical miles. The velocity will have slowed to a relative crawl at this point. The Earth referenced 2,990 feet per second, Moon referenced 3,772 feet per second. Clock counting down to lunar touchdown, which as mentioned before, will likely be changed as the spacecraft goes into lunar orbit and the data is refined, some of the times change a few seconds one way or the other. At any rate, the landing clock now showing 57 hours 17 minutes until lunar landing. At 45 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
046:28:14|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 46 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A little more than a half hour remaining in the crew sleep period. Members of the Green Team of Flight Controllers headed up by prime Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth are coming into the Control Room at this time, and at each console, a handover is taking place from the black watch. At the time - at the present time, the Apollo 11 spacecraft is 67,518 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,787 feet per second. Apollo 11 presently is being tracked by the Madrid S-band station, and at 46 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
046:58:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. The Green Team led by Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth has just relieved Glen Lunney's Black Team. The Flight Surgeon, Dr. Willard Hawkins indicates the crew appears to be still asleep. We're nearing the end of the scheduled rest period. Cliff Charlesworth indicates we will put in a call to the crew within a few minutes. Apollo 11 is 158,681 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,578 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 96,068 pounds.
047:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours, 3 minutes. Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew sleep a little longer. He's just had a conversation with the Flight Surgeon. Dr. Hawkins reports all indications are that the crew is sleeping soundly. The Flight Plan does not warrant awaking them just to get them up. There's no - nothing in the Flight Plan that requires their attention at the present time, so the Flight Director has made a decision to not put in a call to the crew and wake them. Flight surgeon says that a look at the data throughout the night indicates that the crew slept rather well all night.
047:41:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours 41 minutes into the mission. From all indications the crew is still asleep. We're 41 minutes past the end of the scheduled 10-hour rest period now. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew remain asleep and not awaken them from the ground. There is no need to awaken them; nothing scheduled in the Flight Plan that requires their attention at this time. Apollo 11 is 160,137 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3,544 feet per second.
048:00:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours into the Apollo 11 mission. The spacecraft is 160,760 nautical miles from Earth. The distance from the Moon is 64,115 nautical miles. The Earth referenced velocity is 3,529 feet per second. The rest period has now lasted an hour longer than the 10-hour period scheduled. It is extended to 11 hours now. Flight Surgeon says there ate indications that the commander, Neil Armstrong, may be awakening; some stirring around, however, we have not yet put in a call to the crew. The mid-course correction 3, which was scheduled for this afternoon at an elapsed time of 53 hours, 54 minutes, has been canceled. The velocity value for that mid-course is only eight-tenths of a foot per second, so we will not do mid-course correction number 3. We'll continue to standby for either a call from the ground or a call from the spacecraft.
048:09:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
048:09:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours, 9 minutes. We just put in a call to the crew. Here's that conversation.
048:09:08|T|LMP|Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.
048:09:10|T|CC|Good morning, Apollo 11.
048:09:19|T|LMP|... nice sleep. Be getting around to the ...
048:09:34|T|LMP|How's everything look up here from the ground?
048:09:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Roger. Say again, please.
048:09:54|T|LMP|Roger. How do all our systems look?
048:09:59|T|CC|Roger. They're looking great, and as far as we can tell everything is good from down here. Over.
048:10:08|T|LMP|Roger. Looks like the attitude held up real well during PTC last night.
048:10:13|T|CC|Yes, it did. We were showing you remaining well within a circle of 10 degrees radius throughout the night. Seems to be working beautifully.
048:10:37|T|CMP|How's the old Green Team this morning? Did you have a quiet night?
048:10:40|T|CC|Yes. It was a very quiet night. Down here the old Black Team is complaining they didn't get a chance to make any transmissions. Ron Evans is getting -
048:10:53|T|CMP|Well, we'll be seeing them tomorrow, I guess.
048:10:55|T|CC|Yes. Ron's getting to be known as the silent Capcom.
048:11:03|T|CMP|That's the best kind, Bruce.
048:11:05|T|CC|(Laughter) Okay.
048:11:41|T|CC|When you feel up to copying, 11, I've got a couple of small items in the way of a Flight Plan update and your morning consumables update. Over.
048:12:14|T|LMP|Apollo 11.
048:12:17|T|CC|Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a wastewater dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down there at the time for mid-course correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting mid-course correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for mid-course number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn mid-course correction 4, this would then give you a burn for mid-course correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.
048:13:51|T|LMP|- then we'll get to the wastewater dump - -
048:13:56|T|CC|Say again, please. You're cutting out.
048:14:03|T|LMP|Roger. ... - -
048:14:25|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Stand by a minute, please. We're having difficulty receiving you.
048:15:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
048:15:16|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
048:15:19|T|CC|Roger. Reading you the same. We did a minor reconfiguration down here. Stand by. Out.
048:15:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That first conversation was with Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins joined in. We've not yet heard from Neil Armstrong.
048:16:36|T|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. We switched your OMNI antennas as you rolled through the appropriate position. Did you copy the Flight Plan update item?
048:17:06|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over
048:17:14|T|LMP|Apollo 11, go ahead.
048:17:16|T|CC|Roger, 11. Did you copy the Flight Plan update items? Over.
048:17:22|T|LMP|Roger. How do you read me now, Bruce?
048:17:24|T|CC|Loud and clear, now. 
048:17:28|T|LMP|Okay. The battery charge is in the process now and the wastewater dump is in work. MCC 3 has been canceled. It would have been 0.8 feet per second. MCC 4 now looks like about 2.4 feet per second. At around 53 hours we'll do a P52 in PTC. Over.
048:17:55|T|CC|Roger, 11. The magnitudes of the mid-course corrections were just for your information, but mid-course 4 was down around 2.0 feet per second. Again, for your information, on SPS chamber pressure, it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry, and your value of 89 onboard corresponds to 94. Over.
048:18:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Radio check on a new power amplifier in our transmitter. Over.
048:19:01|T|LMP|Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
048:19:04|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear. Did you copy my notes on SPS chamber pressure?
048:19:11|T|LMP|Negative.
048:19:12|T|CC|Okay. Just for your information again, it appears that your readout of 87 psi corresponds to our corrected TM readout of 92 - that's 92 psi, and 89 onboard is really 94 psi. Over.
048:19:48|T|LMP|Roger, I got that you were reading about 5 psi low.
048:19:52|T|CC|Roger. And are you ready for the consumables update?
048:19:59|T|LMP|Ready to copy.
048:20:01|T|CC|Okay. Consumables update for GET of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus 1 pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the RCS total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. Over.
048:20:53|T|LMP|Okay. I copy those, and I'll give you our percentages now: Alpha 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.
048:21:06|T|CC|This is Houston. We copy your percentages, and do you have a crew status report on sleep For us?
048:21:24|T|LMP|Roger. And in descending order 8, 9, and 8. Over.
048:21:30|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
048:22:00|P|PAO|That would be Armstrong 8, Collins 9, Aldrin 8.
048:22:53|T|LMP|Houston, we're getting CRYO pressure warning now in the middle of stirring up the ...
048:23:02|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
048:23:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Flight Surgeon reports that is not a record for sleep. The Apollo 10 crew during one rest period logged 10 hours of sleep.
048:32:35|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy-colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.
048:33:57|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy your weather description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.
048:34:18|T|LMP|It looks like it's a shadow. Coming around to ... background noise ...
048:34:32|T|CC|We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.
048:34:44|T|LMP|Okay. It's coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you ...
048:34:49|T|CC|Roger, we're hearing you.
048:35:00|P|PAO|That's Buzz Aldrin with the description.
048:37:01|T|CC|11, this is Houston. The noise on the COMM seems to have quieted down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the Earth out of view in your window. Over.
048:37:17|T|LMP|Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.
048:37:26|T|CC|Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your wastewater dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the wastewater dump. We're watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.
048:38:14|T|LMP|Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.
048:38:25|T|CC|Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the wastewater dump. We don't recall ever having performed a wastewater dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.
048:38:44|T|LMP|Well, now we know.
048:38:46|T|CC|Roger.
048:42:54|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I am looking at this - these clouds now around Pakistan through the sextant, and it appears to be one single cell in the latter stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one ...
048:45:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.
048:45:56|T|LMP|Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.
048:46:24|T|CC|Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.
048:46:38|T|LMP|Well, I can't see it right now. It's outside the field of view.
048:46:42|T|CC|Roger.
048:46:43|T|LMP|And, I don't know you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.
048:46:50|T|CC|Okay. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.
048:47:00|T|LMP|Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can trace it all the way on up.
048:47:14|T|CC|Roger.
048:47:20|T|LMP|I guess that is down though, isn't it?
048:48:40|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
048:48:46|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
048:48:48|T|CC|Roger. We have been working under the assumption that it would take about an hour for the interference from a wastewater dump to dissipate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation condition, now? Over.
048:49:19|T|CMP|Yes. Stand by one, Bruce.
048:49:21|T|CC|Okay.
048:49:44|T|CMP|My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.
048:50:02|T|CC|Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, there.
048:50:14|T|CMP|Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.
048:50:17|T|CC|Oh, okay.
048:56:36|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few small particles ...
048:56:51|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?
048:57:02|T|LMP|Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the wastewater particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.
048:57:23|T|CC|Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.
048:57:32|T|LMP|No. I see the reflection from the Sun.
048:57:36|T|CC|Roger.
048:57:41|T|CMP|The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.
048:58:13|T|CC|This is Houston. We copy.
049:07:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 7 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 163,040 miles from Earth, velocity 3,476 feet per second.
049:40:42|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
049:41:11|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
049:41:14|T|CC|Go ahead, Apollo 11.
049:41:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead - -
049:41:24|T|LMP|- - How do your read? Over.
049:41:26|T|CC|Roger. We're reading you loud and clear.
049:41:28|T|LMP|Roger. Roger. You're coming back a little scratchy. It,looks like our O2 flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. I just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. Over.
049:41:49|T|CC|Roger.
049:42:45|T|CC|11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning in this fashion. It's probably just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.
049:43:21|T|LMP|Okay. It does look like it's gradually degrading to about zilch.
049:43:28|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
049:52:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours, 52 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 164,558 nautical miles. It's velocity is 3441 feet per second.
050:16:53|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours 16 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 165,346 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3,423 feet per second. Flight Controllers report all systems well within the normal range and operating very satisfactorily.
050:40:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 40 minutes. Apollo 11 is 166,135 miles from Earth. The Capcom is going to take a radio check here, I think, with the crew.
050:41:06|T|CC|Apollo 11 CDR, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
050:41:13|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. CDR. Loud and clear.
050:41:16|T|CC|Roger. We're reading you the same. Out.
050:41:21|T|CDR|And would you check with FAO and see where that errata sheet is? We haven't been able to locate that.
050:41:30|T|CC|Roger. I understand it's supposed to be the back page in Buzz's operational checklist.
050:41:40|T|CDR|Okay.
050:41:44|P|PAO|FAO is the Flight Activities Officer.
050:42:06|P|PAO|Apollo 11's velocity is 3,404 feet per second. Spacecraft's still in the Passive Thermal Control mode rotating at 0.3 of a degree per second or 3 revolutions per hour. Sporadic bursts of static that you hear on the air-ground is caused by the rotation of the spacecraft, the changing the orientation of the antennas as the spacecraft slowly rotates to maintain thermal balance.
050:43:16|P|PAO|The back-up Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise is at the Capcom console with Bruce McCandless.
050:44:47|P|PAO|That radio check was with the Apollo 11 Commander, Neil Armstrong.
050:53:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 53 minutes into the mission. An important news release will be available in the Apollo News Center at 11:45 Central Daylight Time this morning. At noon, Colonel, Frank Borman will be in the building 1 auditorium at MSC for a briefing concerning the news release. Repeating, an important news release will be available at 11:45am  Central Daylight Time in the Apollo news center at MSC.
051:07:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, 7 minutes. Apollo 7 - Apollo 11's distance is 167,007 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,386 feet per second.
051:09:21|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Did you find it? Over.
051:09:28|T|LMP|Roger. We found it.
051:09:31|T|CC|Roger. And I see you're in P00. If you can give us ACCEPT, we'll uplink a new state vector to you and update the CMC clock. Over.
051:09:45|T|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
051:09:48|T|CC|Roger.
051:12:51|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're through with the uplink. You can go back to BLOCK.
051:13:00|T|LMP|Roger. Back to BLOCK.
051:16:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like to terminate the charge on battery B at GET of 51:30. Over.
051:18:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like to terminate charging battery Bravo at 51:30 GET. Over.
051:18:25|T|LMP|Roger. Terminate charging battery Bravo 51:30.
051:18:30|T|CC|Roger. Out.
051:24:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours 25 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 167,594 nautical miles from Earth, moving toward the Moon at a velocity of 3,373 feet per second. All systems are normal. We will be utilizing this release line for the Colonel, Frank Borman briefing. During that briefing we will tape any air-ground transmissions and play them back after the briefing. This is Mission Control Houston.
051:36:35|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We show you terminating battery B charge. Over.
051:37:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
051:38:03|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
051:38:05|T|CC|Roger, 11. We show you terminating battery B charge at about 51 hours 30 minutes. Over.
051:38:17|T|CDR|Okay.
051:38:23|T|CC|Roger. Out.
051:58:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 168,658 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 3,349 feet per second. We have 30 seconds of air-ground conversation taped during the news briefing. We'll play that for you now.
051:59:23|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like to have both oxygen and hydrogen purge on? Over.
051:59:32|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Say again. Both what on? Over.
051:59:41|T|LMP|On the fuel cell purge: would you like to see both oxygen and hydrogen? Over.
052:00:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We request hydrogen and an oxygen fuel cell purge. Over.
052:00:16|T|LMP|Okay. Any preference which first?
052:00:22|T|CC|Negative. As long as you've got the H2 purge line heaters on.
052:00:29|T|LMP|Okay. I'll go get - Go ahead with the hydrogen then.
052:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 52 hours, 40 minutes. Apollo 11 is 170,010 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3,319 feet per second.
052:58:27|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
052:58:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
052:58:36|T|CMP|Roger. You copy my NOUN 93?
052:58:41|T|CC|That's affirmative. We've got it.
052:58:46|T|CMP|Okay. I am going to go ahead and thrust and, triangle difference is 0.01, but it's sort of difficult at 0.3 rate. I'm required to use medium speed unresolved, and it's difficult to hold the star centered long enough to get a decent mark on it.
052:59:13|T|CC|Roger. We copy. It looks okay to us.
052:59:20|T|CMP|Roger.
053:03:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 53 hours, 3 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 170,746 nautical miles from Earth, velocity is 3,303 feet per second. The crew is now in the process of realigning the spacecraft's inertial platform.
053:20:15|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 20 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 171,293 nautical miles, traveling at a velocity of 3,291 feet per second.
053:20:42|P|PAO|The spacecraft's weight is 6,068 pounds.
053:23:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a correction on the orbital parameters of Luna 15 as given in the news briefing recently over. The parameters given in that briefing of 72 by 156 nautical miles were based on a computation from an orbital period of 2 hours and 30 minutes instead of the correct 2 hours and 30 seconds. The orbit has been recomputed based on the proper numbers and the parameters for Luna 15, based on a period of 2 hours 30 seconds are 30 by 110 nautical miles, a perilune of 30, an apolune of 110 nautical miles.
053:51:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
053:51:43|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
053:51:45|T|CC|Roger. I've got the morning news here if you're interested. Over.
053:51:52|T|CMP|Yes, we sure are. We're ready to copy and comment. Isn't that 2:30 there?
053:51:57|T|CC|Roger.
053:52:01|T|CDR|Okay. Go.
053:52:05|T|CC|Okay. Here we go. The interest in the Flight of Apollo 11 continues at a high level but a competing interest in the Houston area is the easing of watering rules. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn-watering restrictions if the rains continue. Friday is partly cloudy, and there is a 30-percent chance of thundershowers in the afternoon. In Washington, D.C., the Senate Finance Committee approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill - -
053:52:36|T|CMP|You cut out, Houston. You cut out.
053:52:40|T|CC|Roger. Where do you hold me cutting out? Over.
053:52:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
053:52:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
053:54:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.
053:54:57|T|CMP|Loud and clear, Houston. Go ahead.
053:54:59|T|CC|Roger.
053:55:00|T|CMP|Start after the rains in Houston.
053:55:03|T|CC|Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.
053:56:39|T|CC|In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early pre-season workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball yesterday, Thursday: St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburgh 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Fransisco 14, and Los Angeles 13. American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out. And in Corby, England, an Irishman, John Coyle has won the world's porridge eating championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in a 10-minute time limit from a field of 35 other competitors. Over.
053:57:48|T|CMP|Roger. I assume Houston didn't play yesterday.
053:57:51|T|CC|That's correct.
053:57:55|T|CMP|I'd like to enter Aldrin in the oatmeal eating contest next time.
053:58:00|T|CC|Is he pretty good at that?
053:58:04|T|CMP|He's doing his share up here.
053:58:13|T|CC|Let's see. You all just finished a meal not long ago, too, didn't you?
053:58:20|T|LMP|I'm still eating.
053:58:24|T|CC|Okay. Does that - that - -
053:58:27|T|CMP|He's on his - He's on his 19th bowl.
053:58:30|T|CC|Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?
053:58:40|T|CMP|Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.
053:59:14|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
053:59:23|T|CMP|Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bag we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.
053:59:44|T|CC|Roger.
054:32:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
054:34:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
054:34:31|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Go ahead.
054:34:33|T|CC|Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the wastewater dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high-gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.
054:35:18|T|CDR|Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.
054:35:29|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.
054:35:34|T|LMP|When you work up an attitude to get high-gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?
054:35:45|T|CC|This is Houston. We'll have a look at it.
054:35:53|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong confirming they will attempt TV at approximately an elapsed time of 56 hours 20 minutes and then the last of the question was by Buzz Aldrin.
054:39:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
054:39:20|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
054:39:21|T|CC|Roger. We have a TV attitude for you if you're ready to copy.
054:39:32|T|CMP|Go ahead. Ready to copy.
054:39:34|T|CC|Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54:45:00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the Command Module and places the high-gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.
054:40:36|T|CMP|Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.
054:40:41|T|CC|Roger. Out.
054:42:54|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. When we pass the proper roll angle, we're not going to be anywhere near zero degrees yaw. Do you want us to just stop at the yaw angle we find ourselves in  and then VERB 49 the three angles you gave us?
054:43:06|T|CC|Stand by.
054:43:20|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to stop at the proper roll angle, then do a VERB 49 to the roll and pitch. Over. Correction, roll and yaw.
054:43:51|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
054:43:53|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
054:44:12|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.
054:44:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
054:44:22|T|CC|Roger, 11. Do you read me? Over.
054:44:38|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
054:44:46|T|CDR|Stand by, Charlie. Yes, we're going to come out of PTC here at 263 roll and then do VERB 49 to the recommended attitude.
054:44:58|T|CC|That sounds fine to us. Over.
054:45:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 45 minutes. Apollo 11 is 173,997 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 3,234 feet per second. In the Control Center, the white team led by Gene Kranz is preparing to relieve Cliff Charlesworth and the Green Team. Capcom is Charlie Duke. We're estimating the change-of-shift news conference for 4:00pm Central Daylight Time.
054:46:55|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Before you open the pressure equalization valve, we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P. Over.
054:47:05|T|CMP|Okay. Let me check it again. It was about 155.
054:47:11|T|CC|Roger.
054:47:13|T|CMP|I read it 158 right now, Charlie.
054:47:16|T|CC|Roger. Thank you much.
054:49:50|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're stopping PTC at 263 ... 0.
054:49:58|T|CC|11, Houston. You're about one-by on this transmission. Say again. Over.
054:50:07|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you read?
054:51:45|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high-gain?
054:51:49|T|CC|11, how do you read me? Over.
054:51:54|T|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Charlie. We just switched to high-gain, and we stopped PTC at roll 263, pitch 90, yaw 0. How do you read?
054:52:02|T|CC|Roger, Mike. You're five-by now on the high-gain. We're right between the OMNI antennas and pretty horrible COMM on the OMNI's. We got you five-by on the high-gain, and we copy the PTC stoppage. Over.
054:52:16|T|CMP|Okay, fine.
054:52:35|T|CMP|Houston, we're going to open the DIRECT O2 valve and start pumping up the cabin.
054:52:39|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
054:53:05|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're going to hand over to Goldstone for uplink in about 2 minutes. We might have a momentary dropout of COMM. Over.
054:53:15|T|CMP|Alrighty. Can you hear our master alarm in the background? That's O2 FLOW HIGH coming through this amplifier.
054:53:26|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
054:53:36|T|CMP|That photoelectric cell is a good device. It's worked very well.
054:53:45|T|CC|11, Houston. Say again. Over.
054:53:50|T|CMP|I say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. It's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone.
054:53:59|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Thank you.
054:54:07|T|CMP|Makes you almost glad to get master alarms.
054:55:00|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. As a matter of curiosity, our O2 flow meter is pegged FULL-SCALE HIGH.
054:55:07|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy that here. Over.
054:55:13|T|CMP|Okay.
054:55:25|T|CMP|Boy, that transducer's working somewhat.
054:55:31|T|CC|Roger.
054:55:51|T|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to try to attempt to correlate your O2 flow in - transducer with the flow valve that you've got open. How far - How far open would you say you have the REPRESS O2? Over. Correction, the DIRECT O2.
054:56:08|T|CMP|Stand by, Charlie.
054:56:18|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now, I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O2 valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O2 flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?
054:56:47|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
054:56:51|T|CC|EECOMM's say they'd like to look at valve positions. Over.
054:57:00|T|CMP|Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 5.4; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.
054:57:17|T|CC|Roger.
054:57:28|T|CMP|It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.
054:57:37|T|CC|Roger.
054:57:46|T|CMP|Our flow is stabilized now at 0.6.
054:57:53|T|CC|Roger. We copy. We're reading the same.
054:57:58|T|CMP|Okay.
054:58:04|T|CMP|Yes, open it back to the one o'clock position.
054:58:09|T|CC|Roger.
054:58:29|T|CMP|Is that enough different positions, or you want more, Charlie?
054:58:35|T|CC|Mike, that's good - good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.
054:58:41|T|CMP|Okay.
055:02:01|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O2, our cabin pressure is 5.7, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O2 valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.
055:02:16|T|CC|Roger.
055:02:19|T|CC|11, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the Command Module the following items. Over.
055:02:34|T|CMP|Ready to copy.
055:02:35|T|CC|Roger. We'd like you to pick up the - out of the flight data file, the surface checklist, the mission rules NO-GO card, the DPS, APS, RCS limit cue card. Over.
055:04:33|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The reason we wanted you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those three. Over.
055:04:43|T|CMP|Roger. We figured you would.
055:09:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 55 hours 10 minutes. Our network controllers just advised that we are receiving live television at Goldstone. We would presume this is a test of the system, similar to what we received from the crew yesterday. The crew is planning to send television from the Lunar Module when they ingress. Stand by - here's a call from the crew.
055:09:57|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're getting the TV at Goldstone. We're not quite configured here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes. Over.
055:10:11|T|CMP|Roger. This is just for free. This isn't what we had in mind.
055:10:16|T|CC|Roger.
055:10:23|P|PAO|That was Capcom, Charlie Duke, advising the crew that we are not quite prepared for television reception at this time. You heard Mike Collins respond that this one's for free. We still intend to get the television transmission during the time the crew is in the Lunar Module, beginning about 56 hours 20 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, which would be about 4:52pm Central Daylight Time.
055:11:17|P|PAO|We are getting a black and white television picture in the Control Center at this time and we should have that in color by now. Interior view of the Command Module looking up into the LM hatch, CSM land hatch area. We can't quite make out which crewman we're seeing up in the tunnel working with the probe and drogue assembly.
055:14:23|P|PAO|Getting a very good view of the work going on in the Command and Service Module tunnel. It appears to be Neil Armstrong working in the tunnel. Operating - working on the drogue and probe assembly.
055:15:00|P|PAO|This extremely sharp clear picture is coming to us from about a 175,000 miles distance from Earth. Presently about 48,000 miles from the Moon.
055:16:44|P|PAO|And, that appears as if it might be all the "free" TV, as Mike Collins put it. Not forgetting, we do expect to get the television transmission from the time the crew is in the Lunar Module and that period of activity is scheduled to begin in about 56 hours 20 minutes with the ingress to the Lunar Module. And we are starting to get a picture back again; losing lock momentarily and now we had it back again. Neil Armstrong up in the tunnel at this point, removing the probe and drogue assembly in preparation for the ingress to the Lunar Module.
055:17:58|P|PAO|Our network controller just reported that this television is coming to us on the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California.
055:19:33|P|PAO|We just saw the probe assembly start to come loose now as Neil Armstrong is -
055:19:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.
055:19:54|T|LMP|Yes, it's loose now.
055:19:56|T|CDR|Can you see that?
055:19:57|T|CC|Roger, Neil. It's really good.
055:20:02|T|CDR|Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.
055:20:09|T|CC|There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.
055:20:21|T|CDR|I think those are the tunnel lights.
055:20:22|T|SC|...
055:20:23|T|CC|Oh, Okay. You're right.
055:20:31|T|LMP|Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.
055:20:34|T|CC|Roger.
055:20:57|T|CC|Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.
055:21:03|T|CDR|You bet. This is the only way ...
055:21:04|T|LMP|You have to take it easy. It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.
055:21:10|T|CC|11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.
055:21:26|T|CDR|Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.
055:21:32|T|CC|Roger.
055:21:38|T|CC|We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.
055:21:59|T|CC|11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.
055:22:11|T|CDR|Roger.
055:22:14|T|CC|We can see the probe now. Correction, the drogue.
055:22:21|T|CDR|Roger.
055:23:03|T|CMP|Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.
055:23:06|T|CC|Roger. As we suspected.
055:23:28|P|PAO|Once removal of the drogue is completed, they will have access to the LM hatch and be able to go into the tunnel.
055:24:06|T|CC|11, Houston. Now it's a good view of the storage area under the couch.
055:24:34|T|CC|11, Houston. Looks like you're pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.
055:24:42|T|CDR|Oh, it's not really bad.
055:24:43|T|LMP|This TV cable is getting in the way.
055:24:53|T|CC|We see lots of arms.
055:25:20|T|CMP|The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.
055:25:27|T|CC|Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.
055:26:11|P|PAO|This unscheduled television transmission has now run about 18 minutes, and we have no estimate at this point as to how long it will continue. Mike Collins reported that it would - we would go ahead with the regularly scheduled one when they are in the LM.
055:26:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.
055:26:38|T|LMP|Roger. We do.
055:26:41|T|CC|Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.
055:26:56|T|LMP|Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?
055:27:00|T|CC|That's affirmative.
055:27:33|P|PAO|Have a good view here of the computer display and keyboard assembly with the green lights flashing.
055:27:41|T|CMP|We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.
055:27:48|T|CC|Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.
055:27:54|T|CMP|And that's a plus.
055:27:56|T|CC|Roger. Plus.
055:28:28|P|PAO|The reference to the roll CAL, or roll calibration index marker in the tunnel, which shows how far off exact 0 the 2 vehicles were when the docking occurred.
055:28:45|T|CC|11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.
055:28:54|T|CDR|It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.
055:28:59|T|CC|Roger.
055:29:07|T|CC|11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.
055:29:22|T|LMP|I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.
055:29:29|T|CC|Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.
055:30:04|T|CMP|Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.
055:30:11|T|CC|That sounds fine to us. Over.
055:30:15|P|PAO|Mike Collins reporting there on the appearance of the latches.
055:30:44|T|CC|11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.
055:30:53|T|LMP|Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.
055:30:56|T|CC|Okay.
055:31:11|T|CC|We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.
055:31:34|T|LMP|Hey, you get an A-plus.
055:31:36|T|CC|Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.
055:31:45|T|CMP|I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.
055:31:53|T|CC|Roger.
055:32:37|P|PAO|An interested observer of these amazingly clear pictures coming to us from more than 175,000 miles out in space is Astronaut, Gene Cernan, who got a first hand view of some of this same area of the spacecraft during his Apollo 10 flight.
055:33:07|T|CC|That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. Over.
055:33:16|T|CDR|Roger.
055:33:24|T|CDR|Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there.
055:33:33|T|CC|Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.
055:33:56|T|CC|11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.
055:34:14|T|LMP|Roger. Thank you.
055:35:23|T|CMP|Okay, the dump valve is actuated.
055:35:26|T|CC|Roger. Copy, 11. We see that very clearly. Is that you, Buzz, with your hand on it?
055:35:32|T|CMP|Yes.
055:35:33|T|LMP|Roger.
055:36:10|T|CC|11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.
055:36:18|T|CMP|It is, considering the amount of light up in there.
055:36:20|T|CDR|Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.
055:36:22|T|CC|Roger.
055:36:32|T|LMP|- that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.
055:36:38|T|CC|How about that. Just like the refrigerator.
055:36:48|P|PAO|That conversation between Charlie Duke and Mike Collins referring to the automatic light that comes on in the LM when the hatch is opened.
055:37:07|T|CC|Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.
055:37:27|T|CC|Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -
055:37:28|T|CDR|(Laugher) We don't see anything loose up there.
055:37:30|T|CC|Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.
055:37:53|T|CC|And, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.
055:38:35|T|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.
055:38:42|T|LMP|Roger. I'm halfway in, I'm going to start turning around, I guess.
055:38:46|T|CC|Roger.
055:38:48|P|PAO|Buzz Aldrin, reporting that he's halfway into the LM. His view is inside the LM cabin.
055:39:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.
055:39:26|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
055:39:50|T|CC|11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.
055:40:00|T|LMP|Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.
055:40:05|T|CC|That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.
055:40:14|T|LMP|Well, that may be good in some respects.
055:40:22|T|CC|We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...
055:40:31|T|LMP|Now let me show you a view looking the other way.
055:40:33|T|CC|Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.
055:40:44|T|CC|I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.
055:41:13|T|CC|We see you waving.
055:41:20|P|PAO|Buzz Aldrin has apparently carried the camera into the LM with him, showing us Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins back in the CSM.
055:41:32|T|CC|11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.
055:41:46|T|CC|11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.
055:41:55|T|LMP|Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.
055:42:18|T|CC|Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.
055:42:28|T|LMP|It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?
055:42:34|T|CC|Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.
055:42:42|T|LMP|Okay.
055:42:46|T|CC|We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.
055:42:58|T|LMP|I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.
055:43:24|T|CC|11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.
055:43:35|T|CC|The light is superb.
055:43:37|T|LMP|How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?
055:43:44|T|CC|It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.
055:44:08|T|LMP|Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.
055:44:16|T|CC|Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.
055:44:29|T|CDR|Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely day-lit; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.
055:44:43|T|CC|Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.
055:44:55|P|PAO|This ingress to the Lunar Module came about 40 minutes ahead of the Flight Plan, and we would presume that the unscheduled TV is perhaps merging with the schedule a little bit early.
055:45:05|T|CDR|Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.
055:45:11|T|CC|Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.
055:45:18|T|LMP|...
055:45:43|T|CC|11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.
055:45:58|T|LMP|Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.
055:46:12|T|CC|Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.
055:46:18|T|CC|11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.
055:46:58|T|LMP|The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.
055:47:04|T|CC|Roger.
055:47:16|T|CC|11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.
055:47:23|T|LMP|Now you know how we feel.
055:47:30|T|LMP|Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.
055:47:35|T|CC|Copy.
055:47:36|T|LMP|And mine's about 5800, also.
055:47:39|T|CC|Copy.
055:47:52|P|PAO|Aldrin's hand resting on one of the portable life support systems which will be used on the Moons surface.
055:48:05|T|CC|11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.
055:48:15|T|LMP|No, that's mine.
055:48:40|T|CC|11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. And, now behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.
055:48:57|P|PAO|We're not quite sure who's holding the camera at this point. Apparently it's drifting freely inside the cabin.
055:49:12|P|PAO|Or more likely attached to some convenient point within the LM cabin.
055:50:02|T|LMP|We're going to go ahead and take all the loop data on back into the Command Module, Charlie.
055:50:07|T|CC|Roger.
055:50:47|P|PAO|This television transmission has now been running about 42 minutes, and the spacecraft now about 176,000 miles from Earth.
055:50:58|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're attempting to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.
055:51:09|T|LMP|Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.
055:51:17|T|CC|Roger.
055:52:15|T|LMP|We got a beautiful view of the side of the Command Module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.
055:52:23|T|CC|Roger.
055:52:24|T|LMP|I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the Command Module.
055:52:40|T|LMP|I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.
055:52:55|T|CC|Roger. Great shot now back down into the -
055:53:03|T|CMP|And left on the - -
055:53:05|T|CC|Go ahead, Buzz. Over.
055:53:07|T|LMP|Say again.
055:53:08|T|CC|I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the Command Module.
055:53:09|T|LMP|...
055:53:14|T|LMP|Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.
055:53:25|T|CC|Roger.
055:53:32|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong has apparently been holding the camera, looking back down through the tunnel it appears now that he's handed the camera to Buzz Aldrin. As he is still looking back through the tunnel we see Mike Collins in the background there.
055:54:08|T|LMP|Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?
055:54:14|T|CC|Stand by.
055:54:17|T|LMP|We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.
055:54:23|T|CC|Roger.
055:54:30|T|LMP|We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the Command Module here and get a little circulation going.
055:54:36|T|CC|Sounds like a good idea. Over.
055:55:04|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.
055:55:17|T|LMP|That we will do.
055:55:53|T|LMP|Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the Command Module right-hand rendezvous window.
055:56:01|T|CC|Roger.
055:56:20|T|CC|Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.
055:56:32|T|LMP|One washer on -
055:56:38|T|LMP|One washer's on by the overhead.
055:56:42|T|CC|Roger.
055:56:49|T|CC|There we go. We got it now.
055:56:58|T|CDR|There wasn't very much debris in the Command Module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.
055:57:14|T|CC|Roger. Sounds good.
055:57:45|T|CC|11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.
055:59:03|T|LMP|Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?
055:59:11|T|CC|11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.
055:59:22|T|CDR|You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.
055:59:39|T|CC|11, Houston. We had a - -
055:59:40|T|LMP|... on my monitor.
055:59:41|T|CC|We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.
055:59:48|T|LMP|Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.
055:59:55|T|CC|Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.
056:00:29|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.
056:00:42|T|LMP|Roger. Will do.
056:01:44|PAO|This transmission has been running about 54 minutes at this point.
056:01:57|T|CC|11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.
056:02:15|T|CC|We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.
056:02:24|T|CC|We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PC O2. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.
056:02:58|T|CC|11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.
056:03:27|T|CC|We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.
056:03:34|T|LMP|Yes. We're going to tape that one over.
056:03:36|T|CC|Roger.
056:03:36|T|LMP|We're going to tape that one over.
056:03:37|T|CC|We concur.
056:03:44|T|LMP|The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.
056:03:53|T|CC|Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.
056:04:17|T|CC|11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.
056:04:30|T|CC|You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.
056:04:38|T|LMP|Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the Flight Plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.
056:04:55|PAO|At this point, we have had to take the color down momentarily. We've run out of tape in the color conversion recorder. We estimate we'll have the black and white for about 5 minutes while the tape changes in process and then continue to convert in color after that point.
056:05:02|T|CC|Stand by, Buzz.
056:05:05|T|LMP|As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.
056:05:22|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.
056:05:36|T|CC|11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -
056:05:56|T|LMP|We understood that, Charlie.
056:05:58|T|CC|Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.
056:06:09|T|LMP|Okay. That's what we'll do.
056:06:53|P|PAO|The black and white view that you're seeing now is the unconverted color picture as it comes down from the spacecraft. The flicker, of course, is taken out in the conversion process. We've now been receiving television pictures from the spacecraft for about 1 hour.
056:07:02|T|LMP|Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.
056:07:24|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.
056:07:35|T|LMP|It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.
056:07:46|T|CC|11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.
056:08:00|T|LMP|Oh, very well. Thank you.
056:08:05|P|PAO|The reference to the friendly geologist refers to Astronaut, Jack Schmitt who is here in the Control Center.
056:08:18|T|LMP|There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.
056:08:25|T|CC|Roger.
056:08:34|P|PAO|And, we're back with the color.
056:09:11|T|CC|The shades couldn't quite hack it, there, Buzz. Over.
056:09:51|T|CMP|Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?
056:09:56|T|CC|Stand by, Mike.
056:10:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.
056:10:18|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
056:10:19|T|CC|You're welcome.
056:11:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.
056:11:34|T|CDR|It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.
056:12:29|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.
056:12:43|T|LMP|Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.
056:12:48|T|CC|What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.
056:12:58|T|LMP|Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.
056:13:02|T|CC|Roger.
056:13:06|T|CDR|It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the Command Module.
056:13:20|T|CC|You probably - -
056:13:21|T|CDR|It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.
056:13:27|T|CC|Houston copies. Out.
056:14:28|T|CC|11, Houston.
056:14:29|T|LMP|You may be able to see some - -
056:14:31|T|CC|Go ahead.
056:14:32|T|LMP|- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.
056:14:42|T|CC|Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.
056:15:51|T|LMP|I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from this position on the right-hand window.
056:16:00|T|CC|Roger.
056:16:15|T|CC|11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.
056:16:32|T|CDR|No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stops, I think.
056:16:43|T|CC|I think that's right.
056:16:51|T|LMP|Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.
056:16:58|T|CC|Roger.
056:17:06|T|CC|11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.
056:17:18|T|LMP|Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.
056:17:42|T|CC|11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.
056:17:58|T|LMP|Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.
056:18:09|T|CC|Roger.
056:18:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.
056:18:32|T|CC|And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.
056:18:42|T|LMP|I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.
056:18:50|T|CC|Roger.
056:20:06|T|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?
056:20:14|T|LMP|It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.
056:20:29|T|CC|Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.
056:20:31|T|LMP|Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.
056:21:03|T|CC|Buzz, we see you putting your window guard in place there, and back up to the ISA now.
056:22:02|T|CDR|Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.
056:22:09|T|CC|Stand by.
056:23:38|T|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? Over.
056:23:46|T|CDR|Yes, he is looking for it now.
056:23:47|T|CC|Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.
056:24:29|T|CDR|Our monitor shows a pretty good, clear picture from this angle. And, we've found the 90-degree bracket.
056:24:38|T|CC|Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, a good picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see - your handles, and now over to the bracket.
056:25:26|T|LMP|That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.
056:25:41|T|CC|Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.
056:26:03|T|CDR|Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.
056:26:12|T|CC|11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.
056:26:20|T|CDR|Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?
056:26:23|T|CC|That's affirmative.
056:26:27|T|CDR|Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.
056:26:39|T|CC|Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.
056:27:37|P|PAO|We've been receiving television now from the spacecraft for about an hour and 20 minutes. Apollo 11 presently 177,000 miles from Earth.
056:27:50|T|CC|What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?
056:27:56|T|CDR|That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.
056:28:03|T|CC|Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.
056:28:18|T|CC|Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.
056:28:26|T|LMP|Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that we've laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.
056:29:14|T|CC|Roger.
056:29:18|T|LMP|And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.
056:29:22|T|CC|Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.
056:30:25|T|CC|11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.
056:30:48|T|CC|11, that's real good camera work.
056:31:07|T|CDR|That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.
056:31:17|T|CC|Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.
056:31:42|T|LMP|We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.
056:32:05|T|CC|Roger.
056:32:11|T|LMP|Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'll not take those out now.
056:32:28|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.
056:32:41|T|LMP|Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?
056:32:45|T|CC|Standby. I think so.
056:32:59|T|CC|11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, Western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.
056:33:16|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. Thank you.
056:33:48|T|CC|Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Appreciate it.
056:34:39|T|CC|Well, that's a good view of Mr. Collins down there. We finally see him again.
056:34:47|T|CMP|Hello there, earthlings.
056:34:52|T|CC|Hello there.
056:35:23|T|CC|11, Houston. We noticed when you were scanning over Panel 2 a moment ago, 1 and 2, the two eight balls were slightly in disagreement. Control said he'd like a AGS align, there.
056:35:40|T|LMP|Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGS.
056:35:45|T|CDR|The problem is, we don't know whether to align AGS to PNGS or PNGS to AGS.
056:35:52|T|CC|Stand by.
056:35:58|T|CC|11, Chris said he can tell you.
056:36:06|T|LMP|We'll cage them both.
056:36:09|T|CC|Roger.
056:37:02|T|LMP|Like old home week, Charlie, to get back in the LM again.
056:37:05|T|CC|Roger. I can imagine.
056:37:25|T|LMP|The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the Command Module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.
056:37:45|T|CC|Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?
056:37:57|T|CDR|We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.
056:38:02|T|CC|Roger. I'd advise him to keep his hands off the switches.
056:38:09|T|CMP|If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.
056:38:14|T|CC|Roger.
056:38:19|T|LMP|That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do. He won't let me touch it any more.
056:38:24|T|CC|Roger.
056:38:44|P|PAO|It appears now that we have a view of Earth out the window.
056:38:55|T|CC|11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.
056:39:01|T|CDR|That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.
056:39:19|P|PAO|That description from Neil Armstrong.
056:39:34|T|CDR|We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?
056:39:42|T|CC|Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.
056:40:00|T|CDR|Roger. We have that in our monitor also.
056:40:21|T|CC|11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.
056:40:36|T|LMP|No, those are the same three ones that we have.
056:40:39|T|CC|Okay.
056:40:48|T|LMP|How far are - out are we now, Charlie?
056:40:52|T|CC|Stand by. Give you exact figure.
056:41:01|T|LMP|Did you notice the difference between yesterday and today? This is as large an image we can - we can give you.
056:41:06|T|CC|Roger. If you think we're smaller, you're now 177,000 miles out. Over.
056:41:14|T|LMP|Thank you.
056:41:15|T|CDR|That's nautical miles?
056:41:18|T|CC|That's affirmative, 11. We -
056:41:22|T|LMP|... Hold on.
056:41:25|T|CC|Go ahead. Over.
056:41:35|T|CC|11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intra-tropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.
056:41:52|T|CMP|Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.
056:41:55|T|CC|Roger.
056:42:06|T|CMP|Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day, is all we ask.
056:42:31|T|CDR|And Charlie, I'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes.
056:42:48|T|CC|Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, certainly appreciate that.
056:43:32|T|CC|11, Houston. We have you - your sub-spacecraft point is just off the western coast of South America directly south of about Mexico City. Over.
056:43:47|T|CDR|That - That looks like what we observe from here.
056:44:02|T|CDR|And we're going to turn our TV monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. Apollo 11 signing off.
056:44:13|T|CC|Roger, 11. Thank you very much. That was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. We sure appreciate it. Over.
056:44:20|T|CDR|It was a pleasure.
056:44:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That television transmission lasted about 1 hour 36 minutes according to our first rough calculation. And during that period of time, the spacecraft traveled something over 2000 nautical miles.
056:45:40|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.
056:45:52|T|CDR|We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.
056:46:13|T|CC|Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.
056:46:25|T|CDR|Okay. We'd like to get a Flight Plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.
056:46:43|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll have that to you in a moment.
056:50:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 56 hours 51 minutes. Buzz Aldrin has now been in the Lunar Module for a little over an hour and 13 minutes. We estimate that Neil Armstrong has perhaps been in the LM about 15 or 20 minutes less than that. Due to the length of that television transmission, the change-of-shift press conference has been canceled. The participants were unable to wait for the duration of the press conference and with other duties and the press conference has been canceled. At 56 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
056:55:58|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a wastewater dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.
056:56:11|T|LMP|Roger. We copy that, Charlie.
056:56:21|T|CDR|How does that work, Charlie?
056:44:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 56 hours 51 minutes. Buzz Aldrin has now been in the Lunar Module for a little over an hour and 13 minutes. We estimate that Neil Armstrong has perhaps been in the LM about 15 or 20 minutes less than that. Due to the length of that television transmission, the change-of-shift press conference has been canceled. The participants were unable to wait for the duration of the press conference and with other duties and the press conference has been canceled. At 56 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
056:57:16|T|CDR|Houston, 11.
056:57:53|T|CC|11, Houston. Did you call? Over.
056:55:58|T|CDR|Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.
056:58:12|T|CC|Roger.
056:58:14|T|CDR|The EVA light still does work.
056:58:17|T|CC|Roger. We'll let this - the SPAN guys look at this, and we'll be back with you with what we think. Over.
056:58:26|T|CDR|Okay.
057:00:10|T|CC|11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.
057:00:25|T|CDR|Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.
057:00:41|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
057:01:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.
057:01:34|T|CDR|Roger. PTC at 58 hours.
057:01:38|T|CC|And we'll have the remaining functions in the Flight Plan soon. Over.
057:01:45|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
057:02:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 3 minutes. The decision, as you heard, relayed up to the crew there, that we would go into the Passive Thermal Control mode with the spacecraft in a slow roll at 58 hours in the Flight Plan, would rule out further television for today. I would also like to repeat that the change-of-shift press conference for the previous shift was canceled due to the length of that television transmission, and we do expect to have a change-of-shift briefing following this shift probably between 11:30 and 12:00pm CDT. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 178,236 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity has dropped down now to 3,146 feet per second. At 57 hours, 4 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
057:03:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as Flight Plan goes, are: Continue your LM familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the CSM, close the hatch, and establish PTC shortly thereafter. Over.
057:04:27|T|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. Terminate the - -
057:04:28|T|CDR|Okay - -
057:04:30|T|CC|- - the water dump. Over.
057:04:30|T|CDR|- - Okay, Charlie. Thank you.
057:04:34|T|CDR|Okay. Water dump being terminated now.
057:17:39|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
057:17:41|T|CC|11, Houston. Go ahead.
057:17:45|T|CMP|Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.
057:17:52|T|CC|Roger, 11. Stand by.
057:18:04|T|CC|11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.
057:18:09|T|CMP|Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?
057:18:17|T|CC|11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some information on the apparent drift rates.
057:18:30|T|CMP|Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the maroons on?
057:18:37|T|CC|Say again, 11.
057:18:41|T|CMP|I say you got the maroons on now?
057:18:43|T|CC|Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The maroon team will be on tomorrow.
057:18:56|T|CMP|Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?
057:18:59|T|CC|Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.
057:19:05|T|CMP|Okay.
057:19:17|T|CC|11, Houston. We suggest you go ahead and do the P52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. Over.
057:19:27|T|CMP|All right. Fair enough.
057:24:50|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
057:24:55|T|CDR|Go ahead. 11, here.
057:24:57|T|CC|11, Houston. A little information to you there, CDR. We've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - I understand it's been sent to us directly from Wapakoneta, your own hometown. Over.
057:25:18|T|LMP|No, we can't - we can't pronounce it either.
057:25:22|T|CDR|I think you'll enjoy that. They make a fine brand of cheese.
057:25:27|T|CC|Roger, there, and I'll polish up the grammar for the next trip.
057:25:40|T|CMP|Houston, 11. You are looking at the NOUN 93, and I'll proceed when you copy them.
057:25:50|T|CC|11, Houston. We've got them.
057:25:58|T|CMP|Okay.
057:28:05|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT. We have a DELTA-H update for you. Over.
057:28:14|T|CMP|All right, Charlie. Stand by one.
057:29:21|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. P00 and ACCEPT.
057:29:23|T|CC|Roger.
057:31:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. The computer's yours. Over.
057:31:47|T|CMP|Houston, 11. Roger.
057:35:55|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like for you to stir up the CRYO's now. Over.
057:36:05|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Roger.
057:44:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 44 minutes. We've had no further reports from the crew to indicate whether or not Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have returned to the Command Module.
057:44:23|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. We're completed in the LM. We're closing up the hatches and the probe and drogue back in.
057:44:42|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Out.
057:44:44|P|PAO|And I guess that would answer our question. Neil Armstrong reporting that they are finished with their work in the LM, will be coming out shortly. Apollo 11 is now 179,490 nautical miles from Earth. Traveling at a speed of 3,121 feet per second. In a little less than 3 hours, we'll pass a milestone of sorts, as the spacecraft passes into the lunar sphere of influence. And what we mean by that, is that at that point, the spacecraft will be under the dominant influence of the Moon's gravity. The Moon's gravitational force will have the predominant effect on the trajectory of the spacecraft. And at that point, our displays in Mission Control monitoring velocity and altitude will switch from Earth reference to Moon reference. We'll then begin monitoring the progress of the spacecraft as it continues to accelerate toward the Moon. At 57 hours 46 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
057:59:37|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by to watch your startup on the PTC at any time. You can start off at the VERB 49. Over.
057:59:48|T|CDR|Wilco. We're just finishing up the probe and about to close up the hatch here. We're going to be a couple of minutes late, probably, getting started in the PTC.
057:59:59|T|CC|Roger. No sweat, 11. We're standing by. Over.
058:00:15|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That was Neil Armstrong reporting that they are now reinstalling the probe and drogue, which is just about on the Flight Plan schedule, and they reported that they would be putting the spacecraft in a slow roll shortly to maintain Passive Thermal Control. In that mode the spacecraft rotates at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain even heating. We have a precise time on that sphere of influence change, the point of which the Moon - for calculation purposes here. Mission Control, comes under the predominate influence - the spacecraft comes under the predominate influence of the Moon's gravitational field, and we now calculate that that will occur at 61 hours, 39 minutes, 55 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time.
058:06:08|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, there's no wait required. Where rates are steady, you can proceed on. Over.
058:06:16|T|CDR|I'm doing it, Charlie.
058:06:17|T|CC|Roger.
058:06:24|T|CMP|The tunnel's all taken care of, the drogue, probe, and hatch all back in.
058:06:28|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.
058:10:01|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some new additions to your alternate contingency checklist if you would break that out. Over.
058:10:15|T|CDR|Stand by.
058:11:46|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. 11's ready to copy.
058:11:48|T|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F/2-22. Over
058:12:27|T|CDR|Okay. I have F/2-22.
058:12:31|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Under column L - that's column Lima, line 06. The new data is 00001. Line 07, the new data is 02134. Over.
058:13:02|T|CDR|Okay. I have in F2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134.
058:13:20|T|CC|Roger. That's correct. Thank you much. Out.
058:13:37|T|CC|11, Houston. For your information, those two entries are an update to your DELTA-H that we have already uplinked into the CMC. Over.
058:13:47|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
058:14:04|T|CMP|What was I marking on, Charlie? About an 18-kilometer line, or what?
058:14:09|T|CC|We - Our update puts you to - the DELTA-H to 35 kilometers, Mike. Over.
058:14:17|T|CMP|Okay.
058:19:24|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got some switch positions for you for the high-gain. Over.
058:19:34|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
058:19:35|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Select Bravo, OMNI, HIGH-GAIN TRACK to MANUAL; BEAM, WIDE. Over.
058:19:49|T|LMP|Okay. Bravo, OMNI; TRACK, MANUAL; and BEAM, WIDE.
058:19:53|T|CC|Roger. And your high-gain angles are minus 50 on the pitch, 270 on the yaw. Over.
058:20:03|T|LMP|Okay. Going there now.
058:41:23|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient anytime for you, we're ready with some updates. Over.
058:41:47|T|CDR|What - What are the updates going to apply to?
058:41:52|T|CC|Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.
058:42:37|T|CDR|Okay. Is any of those in the Flight Plan? The secondary radiator, for example?
058:42:44|T|CC|That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the Flight Plan at 71:20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2-9, L/2-9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.
058:43:09|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
058:43:26|T|CMP|Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the Flight Plan and not fool around with the checklist.
058:43:33|T|CC|Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.
058:43:38|T|CMP|Ready to copy on the leak check.
058:43:41|T|CC|Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?
058:44:22|T|CMP|Yes, I'm with you.
058:44:23|T|CC|Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.
058:45:53|T|CMP|Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?
058:46:29|T|CC|Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.
058:46:49|T|CMP|Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?
058:46:53|T|CC|Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.
058:47:03|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
058:47:33|T|CDR|Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?
058:47:39|T|CC|Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.
059:08:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. Apollo 11 now 182,000 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity down to 3,072 feet per second. We've had very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the Flight Plan calls for the crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the Flight Plan to pass along. The television transmission which had been scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to 100 hours, 50 minutes in the Flight Plan has been deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission from the Flight Plan was made due to a lack of available satellite channels to relay the signal from the tracking site of Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape, the music of course is erased, and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft.
059:10:59|T|CC|11, Houston. We're wondering who's on horns.
059:11:10|T|CDR|Say again, Houston?
059:11:13|T|CC|We just had a little music there.
059:11:22|T|CDR|We'll keep you entertained.
059:11:30|T|CC|Roger. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11.
059:11:38|T|CDR|Okay.
059:12:36|T|CMP|Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.
059:12:47|T|CC|Roger. Happy anniversary.
059:12:52|T|CMP|Thank you, sir. (music)
059:14:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That comment a moment ago about the tenth anniversary of - about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along with John Young, flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18 through July 21, 1966. The brief bit of music that we got from the spacecraft was coming to us from a distance of 182,190 nautical miles.
059:19:33|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.
059:19:36|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
059:19:52|T|CC|Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.
059:20:39|T|LMP|I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.
059:20:47|T|CC|Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.
059:21:17|T|LMP|Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.
059:21:36|T|CC|Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.
059:22:11|T|LMP|Stand by.
059:23:06|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
059:23:08|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.
059:23:30|T|LMP|Okay. That's greater than 120 for less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.
059:23:37|T|CC|That's affirmative. Out.
059:23:47|T|CC|And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.
059:24:33|T|LMP|Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.
059:24:36|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.
059:25:22|T|LMP|Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.
059:25:30|T|CC|That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.
059:25:57|T|LMP|Roger. Got it.
059:25:59|T|CC|Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.
059:26:40|T|LMP|Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".
059:26:43|T|CC|That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ... Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.
059:32:23|T|CDR|This is Apollo 11. Radio check.
059:32:25|T|CC|Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.
059:32:29|T|CDR|Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.
059:32:39|T|CC|Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.
059:33:02|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.
059:33:16|T|CC|Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?
059:33:32|T|CDR|Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.
059:33:40|T|CC|Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.
059:33:46|T|CDR|Okay.
059:34:35|T|CC|11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.
059:35:15|T|CDR|Roger. I think I understand.
059:35:19|T|CC|Roger.
059:35:47|T|LMP|Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?
059:35:52|T|CC|Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.
059:35:57|T|LMP|Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.
059:36:02|T|CC|Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.
059:36:14|T|LMP|Roger. You were cut out that time.
059:36:17|T|CC|Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over.
059:36:39|T|CC|11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?
059:37:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.
059:37:29|T|LMP|Apollo 11, understand.
059:45:34|T|CDR|Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you.
059:45:37|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead, 11.
059:45:41|T|CDR|Okay. Radiation: CDR 11009, CMP 10010, LMP 09011. No medication.
059:45:58|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations. And, we're considering - this PTC looks sort of weird to us, so we're considering stopping and starting over again, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over.
059:46:17|T|CDR|Okay.
059:47:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
059:48:48|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
059:49:46|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
059:49:51|T|CMP|Go ahead. 11 here.
059:49:53|T|CC|Roger. We switched antennas on you, there, moments ago, Neil. Could you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
059:50:02|T|CMP|It's less than 0.1.
059:50:05|T|CC|Roger.
059:50:15|T|CMP|0.15, now, Neil says, Charlie.
059:50:18|T|CC|Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before. We were wondering if you have had any events or any idea that could help us out. Over.
059:50:38|T|CMP|I didn't understand that. Say again.
059:50:40|T|CC|Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over.
059:51:11|T|CMP|Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything.
059:51:14|T|CC|Roger.
059:51:15|T|CMP|Unless it's got something to do with that entry from ... from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.
059:51:23|T|CC|Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.
059:51:42|T|CMP|Okay.
059:55:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. Over.
059:55:44|T|CMP|Roger.
059:57:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours 57 minutes. A few moments ago you heard Capcom, Charlie Duke advise the crew to terminate the Passive Thermal Control mode that they are presently in and reestablish the three revolution per hour roll rate about the spacecraft longitudinal axis that is used for thermal control. We had noticed a unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode, ideally, it would roll about the longitudinal axis with very little wobble and if wobble is introduced for one reason or another, the Reaction Control System jets would come on as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had occurred and gone beyond prescribed limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct. The jet firings on past missions do tend to disturb the crews sleep. Rather than have the Reaction Control System jets come on during the night and perhaps have to awaken the crew to reestablish the Passive Thermal Control at that time we elected to correct it now.
059:58:40|T|CC|11, Houston. We recommend you disable Bravo and Charlie; select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.
059:59:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
060:00:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're getting quite a bit of noise on the air to ground circuit at this time as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna around to the next, and we momentarily lose lock-on. At this time, Apollo 11 is 183,544 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity, holding fairly constant now, at about 3,042 feet per second. It's been moving down towards 3000 feet per second and seems to be leveling off somewhat.
060:02:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're going to take the air to ground circuit down temporarily until a stronger antenna lock is - . Here's a call to the crew. We'll stand by for that.
060:02:33|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
060:03:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We will take down the air to ground circuit down at this time until we reestablish sufficient signal strength to eliminate the noise on the circuit.
060:03:10|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
060:03:40|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
060:05:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
060:09:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 10 minutes. We've reestablished good antenna lock-on at this time, and we'll continue to monitor for any conversation from the spacecraft. The crew is presently reestablishing the Passive Thermal Control rotation rate of 3 revolutions per hour. Following that, we expect they will begin their rest period. At the present time Apollo 11 is 183,821 nautical miles from Earth at a velocity 3,037 feet per second.
060:11:09|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Hello, Apollo 11. Over.
060:11:32|T|LMP|... Apollo 11. Go ahead.
060:11:35|T|CC|Roger. Reading you about one-by. Looks like we picked a super attitude here for PTC stabilization. We're reading you in BACKUP VOICE now. Over.
060:11:51|T|LMP|Roger. We read you loud and clear.
060:11:53|T|CC|Roger.
060:12:03|T|LMP|Would you like us to pick another antenna?
060:12:06|T|CC|I think we've got about the best configuration. We've been doing it all from the ground here, 11. We'll just keep it as it is. Over.
060:12:17|T|LMP|Roger.
060:14:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you select COMMAND RESET and OMNI Alfa? Over.
060:15:03|T|CDR|Houston, 11 on OMNI Alfa.
060:15:06|T|CC|Roger. We read you about three-by now. Over.
060:15:12|T|CDR|Roger.
060:17:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We is stable; you can start the PTC. Over.
060:17:29|T|SC|...
060:20:58|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Checklist page F/9-7; I've completed step 8, and I'd like to know what you think is ideal timing between step 8, step 9, and step 10 on that page? Over.
060:21:15|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
060:22:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We don't see any time constraint. We'd like you to go ahead and set up the wide deadband and then go through step 10 and 11. Over.
060:22:57|T|CMP|Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure, because last time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the past.
060:23:09|T|CC|Roger.
060:23:58|T|CMP|Step 11 complete.
060:24:01|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
060:24:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please select OMNI Bravo? Over.
060:24:30|T|CMP|Roger. Bravo.
060:24:43|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on Bravo?
060:24:45|T|CC|Roger. Reading you five-by.
060:24:51|T|CMP|Same here.
060:25:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Looks like we've got a good PTC going. It's good night from the White Team. Over.
060:25:17|T|CMP|Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for everything.
060:36:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 37 minutes. We said goodbye - goodnight to the crew about 10 minutes ago. We expect that they will be settling down their rest period shortly. And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest in a comment made by Neil Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a contingency EVA. It would have no function in a normal mission such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the Command and Service Module, the light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would - repeat, that it'd have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that we get and play those back. The Passive Thermal Control mode, which was reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally. At 100 - rather at 60 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
060:45:38|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11.
060:45:41|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
060:45:46|T|CDR|Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is with respect to us?
060:45:50|T|CC|Stand by.
060:47:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control an 60 hours 47 minutes. We just got a call from the spacecraft requesting that we give them the position of the S-IVB in respect to the spacecraft and we're currently coming up with that bit of information, so we'll stand by.
060:49:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The S-IVB is about 6,000 nautical miles from you now. Over.
060:49:14|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
060:50:07|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How's the PTC looking?
060:50:11|T|CC|Stand by.
060:50:32|T|CC|11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.
060:50:39|T|CMP|Hey, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?
060:50:43|T|CC|We have absolutely no idea. Over.
060:50:49|T|CMP|Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?
060:50:57|T|CC|That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it post-flight, it's got - it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.
060:51:39|T|CMP|Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.
061:39:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 61 hours, 39 minutes. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report. Flight Surgeon says there is no indication at this time that they have begun to sleep, but we expect they'll be getting to sleep here shortly. Coming up in less than 10 seconds now, we'll be crossing into the sphere of influence of the Moon. A computational changeover will be made here in Mission Control. At this point as the Moon's gravitational force becomes the dominant effect on the spacecraft trajectory, and our displays will shift from Earth reference to Moon reference. At that point, which occurred a few seconds ago, the spacecraft was at a distance of 186,437 nautical miles from Earth, and 33,822 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity with respect to the Earth was 2,990 feet per second, and with respect to the Moon, about 3,272 feet per second. The Passive Thermal Control mode that was set up for the second time by the crew appears to be holding well at this point, and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally, the mission going very smoothly. At 61 hours, 41 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
062:29:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 62 hours 29 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that the crew appears to have been asleep now for about the past 30 minutes. The spacecraft appears, also, to be holding its Passive Thermal Control attitude very well. And, at this time Apollo 11 is about 32,000 miles from the Moon traveling at a speed of 3,782 feet per second. In the past 50 minutes or so, we have seen that velocity increase about 10 feet per second going from 3,772 feet per second to the present 3,782 as the spacecraft continues to accelerate toward the Moon. The change-of-shift briefing following this shift will occur at about 11:15pm Central Daylight Time. Flight Director, Glynn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers are coming on now - being debriefed by the Eugene Kranz team and that shift change will be occurring shortly here. The new Capsule Communicator will be Astronaut, Ron Evans. At 62 hours 30 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
063:29:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 63 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 5 1/2 hours remaining in the Apollo 11 crew scheduled rest period. The crew apparently soundly asleep at this time. Spacecraft now 29,716 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity now 3,796 feet per second. Black Team Flight Director, Glynn Lunney going around the room discussing with the various flight control positions the situation for the sleep shift. Talking now to flight dynamics officer on the pros and cons of doing or not doing mid-course correction burn number 4. And at 63 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
064:28:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 64 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 4 1/2 hours remaining now in the scheduled Apollo 11 crew sleep period. However, since there is little likelihood that mid-course correction burn number 4 will be done, since it's a very small magnitude maneuver, that the crew will be allowed to sleep another couple of hours. At this time, Apollo 11 is some 27,529 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,812 feet per second. The Black Team of Flight Controllers has settled in for the night. Everything rather quiet here in the Control Room. We're anticipating a playback of yesterday afternoon's TV transmission from Apollo 11 which lasted some hour and a half in which the camera was taken into the Lunar Module at the end of it's cable. This will be played back for the Flight Controllers who, at that time, were - most of them were asleep. At 64 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.
065:28:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 65 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 3 1/2 hours remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew of Apollo 11. However, this will likely run into more like 5 1/2 hours remaining. Countdown clock for lunar landing now showing 37 hours, 18 minutes. Apollo 11 now 25,280 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,832 feet per second. In terms of distance - stand by, we thought we had some Earth reference numbers, but apparently that display is not up at this time. Present weight of the spacecraft 96,029 pounds. Presently being tracked by the tracking station at Honeysuckle Creek in Australia. And at 65 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
066:29:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 66 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently 22,952 nautical miles out from the Moon, and traveling at a velocity of 3,858 feet per second. 2 hours 29 minutes remaining in the sleep period. However, as mentioned earlier, this likely will run another 2 hours. Clock counting down to lunar landing, showing 36 hours 16 minutes. Still tracking through the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station. And, all is rather quiet here in the Control Center during the sleep watch. At 66 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
067:28:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 67 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Mid-course correction burn number 4 has been deleted from the Flight Plan on the recommendation to Flight Director, Glynn Lunney from the Flight Dynamics Officer, Jay Green. The maneuver, had it been carried out as planned, would be in the neighborhood of one-half foot per second velocity change. As it is now, the trajectory is being predicted to arrive at near point or closest approach of about 62 nautical miles plus or minus two miles if nothing else is done to the trajectory. That is if no maneuver is made. The spacecraft cabin pressure now holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Temperature, 60 degrees F. The planned sleep period has another hour and one-half to go but as mentioned earlier it will likely run another couple hours in as much as mid-course correction burn number 4 will not be made and the crew will not have to spend the time preparing to do the burn - align the platform and do all the chores necessary for doing a maneuver of this sort. Clock counting down to lunar landing showing 35 hours, 17 minutes. And at 67 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
068:28:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 68 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 2 hours and 31 minutes remaining crew sleep period according to the revised schedule inasmuch as mid-course correction burn number 4 has been omitted. Still being tracked - Apollo 11 is still being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station. And, here in Mission Control, yesterday's hour and a half long television pass as the crew manned the LM for the first time in checkout is being replayed. This will be piped across to the news center for anyone who might want to view it again. At 68 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.
069:10:24|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
069:11:01|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
069:13:14|T|CT|Goddard voice, Houston COMM TECH. Goss conference.
069:13:17|T|MSFN|You're loud and clear. How me?
069:13:19|T|CT|Roger. Read you the same.
069:13:21|T|MSFN|Roger.
069:17:37|T|CT|Madrid, Houston COMM TECH. Net 1, voice check.
069:17:41|T|CT|Houston COMM TECH, Madrid. I read you loud and clear.
069:17:44|T|CT|Roger. Read you loud and clear also.
069:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. So much for that. Looks like they'd rather turn over and go back to sleep. At 69 hours, 19 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
069:18:07|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
069:18:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Good morning.
069:18:21|T|LMP|Good morning. Are you planning a mid-course correction 4 this morning?
069:18:26|T|CC|That's negative. Mid-course number 4 is not required. We were going to let you sleep in until about 71 hours if you'd like to turn over.
069:18:38|T|LMP|Okay. That'll be fine. ...
069:18:48|T|CC|Say again, Buzz. You were cut off there.
069:18:52|T|LMP|Okay. I'll see you at 71 hours.
069:18:55|T|CC|Roger.
069:19:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, so much for that! Looks like they're going to turn over and go back to sleep. At 69 hours, 19 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
070:59:10|P|PAO|Planned wake-up time for the crew is 71 hours elapsed. Cliff Charlesworth and the Green Team of Flight Controllers has just relieved Glynn Lunney's Black team. Capcom now is Bruce McCandless. Apollo 11 is 13,638 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity, 4,047 feet per second, lunar referenced.
071:00:05|P|PAO|Apollo 11 is 12,486 nautical miles from the Moon. Approaching at a velocity of 4,087 feet per second. We will stand by here and see whether we put in a call to the crew.
071:02:59|P|PAO|We're putting a call into the crew now.
071:03:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
071:03:37|T|LMP|Good morning again, Houston. Apollo 11.
071:03:40|T|CC|Roger 11. Good morning. When you - -
071:03:48|T|LMP|Would you like the O2 purge this morning?
071:03:52|T|CC|Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a Flight Plan update containing - I guess that, and some other items for you.
071:04:08|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
071:06:58|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update.
071:07:03|T|CC|Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're coming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: a maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high-gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal Flight Plan at 74 hours GET. Over.
071:09:07|T|LMP|Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplinked REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 degrees - now is this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?
071:09:44|T|CC|This is with the - -
071:09:45|T|LMP|- - ... antenna and, pitch - -
071:09:49|T|CC|- - This is with the new REFSMMAT, Buzz.
071:09:58|T|LMP|You said you want the P52 done at that attitude with the new REFSMMAT?
071:10:04|T|CC|Roger.
071:12:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
071:12:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
071:12:33|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
071:12:40|T|CMP|Houston, go ahead.
071:12:42|T|CC|Roger, 11. Correction on my last. At 73:20, we uplink you the new REFSMMAT. And at 73:30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old REFSMMAT. And then torque around to the new REFSMMAT and run your P52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. Over.
071:13:12|T|CMP|Roger, Understand.
071:13:14|T|CC|I've got consumables update, when you're ready to copy.
071:13:21|T|LMP|I just got up, but you didn't catch me on that one.
071:13:25|T|CC|I say I have one for you.
071:13:55|T|LMP|Okay. We're ready to copy that consumable update.
071:13:58|T|CC|Roger. As of GET 68:00, RCS total minus 4.5 percent, corresponding to approximately minus 53 pounds. Alfa minus 6.0 percent, minus 1.0 percent, minus 7.0 percent, minus 3.0 percent; H2 total, minus 1.2 pounds; O2 total, plus 10 pounds. Over.
071:14:49|T|LMP|Roger. And our readouts onboard are Alfa is 82, Bravo is 84, Cocoa is 84, and Delta is 87.
071:15:08|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
071:15:13|T|LMP|And you want us to cycle the O2 and H2 fans, I imagine, huh?
071:15:23|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Affirmative. Over.
071:15:31|T|LMP|Okay.
071:23:26|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I have a status report for you.
071:23:33|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
071:23:37|T|LMP|Roger. On sleep; CDR, CMP, 7.5; LMP, 6.5. Over.
071:23:45|T|CC|Roger. 7.5 for each. Over.
071:23:53|T|LMP|Negative. LMP 6.5.
071:23:56|T|CC|Roger. 7.5, 7.5 and 6.5. And, I got a few words for you here on the SPS engine performance. Over.
071:24:13|T|LMP|Okay. We're ready to listen.
071:24:17|T|CC|Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC readings is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage onboard correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.
071:25:36|T|CDR|Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.
071:25:39|T|CC|Houston. Out.
071:31:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 71 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now 11,232 nautical miles approaching at a velocity of 4,141 feet per second.
071:33:08|T|LMP|Houston. Apollo 11.
071:33:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
071:33:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
071:33:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
071:33:47|T|CDR|Houston, do you read Apollo 11?
071:33:49|T|CC|Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.
071:33:59|T|LMP|Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.
071:34:11|T|CC|Roger.
071:34:15|T|LMP|It's quite an eerie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.
071:34:26|T|CC|Roger.
071:34:30|T|LMP|And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine.
071:34:55|T|And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.
071:35:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
071:35:44|T|LMP|Go ahead.
071:35:46|T|CC|Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand-hold this, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.
071:36:24|T|LMP|Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.
071:36:29|T|CC|Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not-to-interfere basis, of course. Over.
071:36:42|T|LMP|Okay.
071:36:46|T|CC|And on the exposures we're looking for an 1/8 of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.
071:37:10|T|LMP|Roger. We copy.
071:37:12|T|CC|Roger. Out.
071:39:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
071:39:23|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
071:39:24|T|CC|Roger. We'd like to do a little CRYO tank balancing. So, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the CRYO switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.
071:39:47|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.
071:39:50|T|CC|Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.
071:40:13|T|CDR|... bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.
071:40:30|T|CC|Roger. Out.
071:43:10|T|CDR|... We've got quite a few pictures ...
071:44:05|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. I think we have COMM again. We heard you calling. Over.
071:44:26|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.
071:44:48|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters OFF for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?
071:44:56|T|CC|That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF and oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.
071:45:05|T|CMP|Okay.
071:45:07|T|CC|Roger. Out.
071:45:12|T|CMP|I have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF; I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.
071:45:17|T|CC|Roger. Out.
071:52:15|T|CMP|Houston. Apollo 11. The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.
071:52:23|T|CC|Oh, very good.
071:55:59|T|CDR|And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.
071:56:35|T|CC|Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.
071:56:51|T|CDR|That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.
071:57:06|T|CC|Roger.
071:57:58|P|PAO|That last transmission was from Neil Armstrong.
071:59:20|T|CDR|Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But, all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.
071:59:51|T|CC|I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it?
071:59:57|T|CDR|Really has.
072:04:57|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
072:07:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours, 7 minutes. Apollo 11 is 9,761 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 4,217 feet per second. Weight 9,612 pounds.
072:13:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
072:14:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
072:14:43|T|CDR|Okay. We went to high-gain. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.
072:14:48|T|CC|Roger. We missed an OMNI switch there. Over.
072:14:55|T|CDR|All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.
072:15:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that's normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.
072:15:49|T|CDR|Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?
072:15:55|T|CC|Roger. Press on.
072:17:25|T|CDR|And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.
072:17:30|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
072:17:39|T|CMP|And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.
072:17:45|T|CC|That's for sure.
072:17:50|P|PAO|That was a Mike Collins comment.
072:17:59|T|CC|The Flight Director says "ouch."
072:18:12|T|CMP|No. No "ouch" intended. I enjoyed every one of those meetings.
072:19:09|T|CC|11, this is Houston. I have your pericynthion plus 2 PAD, P30 format; when you're ready to copy.
072:19:24|T|CDR|Roger. Stand by.
072:20:17|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy pericynthion plus 2.
072:20:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Pericynthion-plus-2 hours PAD. SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; GET ignition 077:46:22.48, Delta-VX NOUN 81, plus 3214.8, minus 0045.5, minus 1037.7; roll NA, pitch 307, and the remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align stars; Vega and Deneb. Roll 243, 183, 012; no ullage. Remarks: Assumes landing site REFSMMAT and docked. Over.
072:21:48|T|LMP|Roger. SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; 077:46:22.48; plus 3214.8, minus 0045.5, minus 1037.7; NA, 307; Vega and Deneb; 243, 183, 012; no ullage. Landing site REFSMMAT, docked. And you haven't - change on the LM weight. Over.
072:22:30|T|CC|No change in the LM's weight - in the LM weight, and the readback is correct. Out.
072:25:05|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
072:25:12|T|CDR|Roger. Go ahead.
072:25:14|T|CC|Roger. We're having difficulty getting commands into the spacecraft. We'd like you to cycle your UP TELEMETRY switch to COMMAND RESET and OFF and then back to NORMAL. Over.
072:25:31|T|CDR|Okay. We'll do it.
072:25:50|T|CDR|We have you on high-gain right now. You want us to switch over to OMNI?
072:26:02|T|CC|Negative. We Would like to stay on the high-gain if we can. Over.
072:26:10|T|CDR|Okay.
072:27:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
072:27:23|T|CDR|Go ahead.
072:27:25|T|CC|Roger. We'd like you to switch to OMNI Delta as we show you approximately at the scan limit of the high-gain antenna. We will then command OMNI Delta down here after you advise us you've switched, and then you can select Bravo onboard and we will be back in the OMNI antenna commanding business. Over.
072:27:46|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to Delta now.
072:28:15|T|CC|11, Houston. You can go ahead and select OMNI Bravo onboard now.
072:28:23|T|CDR|You have it. 
072:28:27|T|CC|Roger. Out.
072:29:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, we can read you up the morning news here.
072:29:34|T|CDR|Go right ahead; let's hear it.
072:29:36|T|CC|Roger. Hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office, especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.
072:29:46|T|CC|Okay. First off, it looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil, "The Czar of the Ship." I think maybe they got the wrong mission.
072:30:06|T|CC|West Germany has declared Monday to be "Apollo Day." School children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places.
072:30:24|T|CC|BBC in London is considering a special radio alarm system to call people to their TV sets in case there is a change in the EVA time on the Moon.
072:30:35|T|CC|And in Italy, Pope Paul VI has arranged for a special color TV circuit at his summer residence in order to watch you, even though Italian television is still black and white.
072:30:48|T|CC|Back here in Houston, your three wives and children got together for lunch yesterday at Buzz's house. And according to Pat, it turned out to be a gabfest. The children swam and did some high jumping -
072:31:04|T|CDR|I believe it!
072:31:04|T|CC|- over at Buzz's bamboo pole.
072:31:10|T|CC|In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.
072:31:35|T|CC|Even the kids at camp got into the news when Mike Jr. was quoted as replying "yeah" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. Then after a short pause he asked, "What is history?"
072:31:55|T|CC|In Washington, President Nixon is planning to use his executive power to streamline the Interstate Commerce Commission. According to industry sources, it was reported Nixon would trim the commission from 11 to 7 members by not making new appointments.
072:32:12|T|CC|And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the sports world, the Houston Astros rallied in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak. The Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out, Jesus Alou stroked a single to right field. John Edwards hit another single to right, and Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice fly by Dennis Menke brought in the final run. They really came through in the ninth.
072:32:55|T|CC|And other games in the National League - -
072:32:57|T|CMP|Yes. Those Astros have really been catching those flies since they put a roof on the stadium.
072:33:05|T|CC|Good work.
072:33:19|T|CC|In other games in the National League, New York beat Montreal 5 to 2; Pittsburgh beat St. Louis 4 to 1; and Atlanta over San Diego in the first game of a double header 6 to 2.
072:33:32|T|CC|In the American League, Detroit beat Cleveland 4 to nothing; New York trounced Washington 5 to nothing; Baltimore outhit - Boston outhit Baltimore to score 6 runs to the Orioles' 2; and Chicago beat Kansas City 6 to 1.
072:33:50|T|CC|Okay. In golf world, Tommy Jacobs, an infrequent competitor in recent years, took the lead in the Philadelphia Golf Classic yesterday. His second round score was 139.
072:34:02|T|CC|You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.
072:34:56|T|CC|And last but not - -
072:34:58|T|CMP|Who said all that?
072:35:00|T|CC|(Laughter) Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now we checked with Flight Operations for all the signs for the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.
072:35:50|T|CDR|Houston, 11. You're cutting out ...
072:35:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're switching OMNI's. Can you stand by for about 2 minutes?
072:29:00|P|PAO|That was Fred Haise alternating with Bruce McCandles on the newscast.
072:37:30|T|CDR|Houston, 11. Radio check.
072:37:34|T|CC|11, Houston. Go ahead.
072:37:41|T|CDR|Roger. You cut out after Tommy Jacobs. I guess we got into antenna switching problems.
072:37:48|T|CC|Okay. Following Tommy Jacobs, we have the hot smoking word from a local Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses but is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling," Buzz is supposed to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone, in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she decided he either has the same attributes as Neil or that he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative. And that's 30 for today. Over.
072:38:50|T|CDR|Thank you much there, Bruce and Fred Show, we appreciate that.
072:38:58|T|CC|Roger.
072:39:03|P|PAO|That was Fred Haise alternating with Bruce McCandless on that newscast.
072:39:13|T|CMP|Did you hear our comment about the Astros?
072:39:17|T|CC|The one about the roof?
072:39:22|T|CMP|Yep.
072:39:44|T|CC|Hey, Mike, the game was at Cincinnati there, and we think that they're still using Crosby Field up there. I don't believe it has a roof on it.
072:40:00|T|LMP|You got him on that one.
072:40:02|T|CC|Right - -
072:40:02|T|CDR|I think they're just getting to be a good team in the clinch.
072:40:06|T|CC|They certainly seem to be.
072:40:11|T|CMP|Well, if they can do that well without a roof, think of what they're going to do with a roof.
072:40:15|T|CC|Roger. Out.
072:40:21|T|CMP|We're trying.
072:40:40|T|CMP|An old Oiler fan is trying to comment on an alien game.
072:41:22|T|CMP|You tell Michael Jr., history or no history, he'd better behave himself.
072:41:28|T|CC|Roger. We'll pass that along, Mike.
072:45:36|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours, 45 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 8,188 nautical miles from the Moon approaching at a velocity of 4,324 feet per second.
072:48:58|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient with you, we have an LOI 1 PAD that we can pass up to you now. Over.
072:49:10|T|CDR|Stand by.
072:49:17|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The next time we pass through roll 0, we're going to stop PTC and that will give us 90 degrees pitch. Now, I understand you want us to move from 90 degrees pitch to 0 degrees pitch for the platform align, option 1. Is that affirmative?
072:49:42|T|CC|Standby, please.
072:49:47|T|CDR|And we are ready to copy on the LOI 1.
072:50:36|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you stop at 0 roll, you will be in approximately 90 pitch, 0 yaw, and 0 roll. We'd like you to run the first P52, that is, the P52 option 3, from that attitude. Then we'll uplink you a new REFSMMAT, either before or while you are maneuvering to 000, and then you can torque the platform around and run the second REFSMMAT. Over. Run the second P52. Over.
072:51:13|T|CMP|Okay.
072:51:15|T|CC|And I copied you are ready for the LOI 1 pad. Over.
072:51:22|T|CDR|Go ahead.
072:51:23|T|CC|LOI-1, SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19, GET ignition 075:49:49.65; minus 2889.7, minus 0394.4, minus 0068.6; roll 358, pitch 226, 347; 0169.2, plus 00610; 2917.3, 6:02, 2910.8; sextant star 31, 1066, 358. Remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align, Vega and Deneb, 243, 183, 012. No ullage. The horizon will be visible just below the upper edge of the hatch window, 2 minutes prior to the LOI burn. It will not be visible in the rendezvous window on the left-hand side. LOS at 75 hours, 41 minutes, 23 seconds. AOS at 76:15:29. AOS without the LOI burn, 76:05:30. The values which you would see on Noun 42 prior to LOI burn are HA, plus 431.3; HP, minus 128.2. Read back, over.
072:53:54|T|CDR|Roger. LOI-1, SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; 075:49:49.65; minus 2889.7, minus 0394.4, minus 0068.6; 358, 226, 347; 0169.2, plus 0061.0; 2917.3, 6:02, 2910.8; 31, 106.6, 35.8. GDC align, Vega and Deneb, 243, 183, 012. No ullage. Horizon in the hatch window, 2 minutes before TIG. AOS with an LOI, 76:15:29; AOS without an LOI, 76:05:30. HA before the burn, 431.3; HP, minus 128.2. Say again LOS time.
072:55:47|T|CC|Roger. LOS time 75:41:23. Over.
072:55:58|T|CDR|Understand 75:41:23.
072:56:03|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
072:56:20|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong with the readback of the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn number 1 pad. The ignition time for that burn 75 hours 49 minutes 49 seconds. That's 2 hours 57 minutes 49 seconds from this time. Duration of that burn 6 minutes 2 seconds, retrograde, and the change in velocity 2,917.3 feet per second. The expected orbit following that maneuver is 169.2 by 61 nautical miles. To repeat, the LOS AOS times we will lose signal with Apollo 11 at 75 hours 41 minutes 23 seconds as it goes behind the Moon. Given a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion number 1 burn we will acquire the signal at 76 hours 15 minutes 29 seconds. If for some reason Apollo 11 can not perform the burn, we will acquire the spacecraft at 76 hours 5 minutes 30 seconds.
073:04:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
073:04:43|T|CDR|Go ahead.
073:04:44|T|CC|Roger. Apparently we missed getting your onboard readouts on battery Charlie and PYRO batteries Alfa and Bravo last night. I wonder if you could give us some fresh numbers. Over.
073:04:59|T|CDR|You want the readings now?
073:05:01|T|CC|Yes, please. If it's convenient for you.
073:05:16|T|LMP|Okay. All three of them are still 37.1.
073:05:19|T|CC|Roger. 37.1 cubed. Out.
073:06:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours, 6 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now 7,331 nautical miles. Velocity is 4,399 feet per second. The ignition time passed up to the crew on this pad is 4 minutes, 39 seconds earlier than the LOI 1 time published in the Flight Plan prior to liftoff. This means that all lunar events will move forward from the published Flight Plan time by this amount of time - 4 minutes, 39 seconds. This time will be made up during the transearth coast, and splash should occur at the Flight Plan time. This is Mission Control, Houston.
073:09:14|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The P52 option 3 is complete. We're maneuvering to 000.
073:09:19|T|CC|Roger. We observe your maneuvering, and we'll have some uplinks for you in a couple of minutes here.
073:09:27|T|CMP|Okay.
073:13:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We observe you're in P00. If you'll give us ACCEPT, we'll start our uplinks.
073:13:24|T|CMP|You've got it, Houston.
073:13:25|T|CC|Roger. Out.
073:16:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
073:16:58|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
073:16:59|T|CC|Roger. We're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. Over.
073:17:11|T|CDR|I guess we're in no rush.
073:17:14|T|CC|Okay. We're here if you're there.
073:17:24|T|CDR|The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It fills about three quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. It's a view worth the price of the trip.
073:17:45|T|CC|Well, there are a lot of us down here that would be willing to come along.
073:17:55|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
073:17:58|T|CMP|I hope you get your turn, and soon.
073:18:10|T|CDR|One of these days, we'll be able to bring the whole MOCR along, I hope. Save a lot of antenna switching.
073:18:21|T|CC|Say again, 11.
073:18:26|T|CDR|One of these days, we could bring the whole MOCR along, and then that'll save a lot of antenna switching.
073:18:33|T|CC|That's Jolly.
073:18:40|P|PAO|The MOCR is the Mission Operations Control Room. That's the Control Center here.
073:20:21|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
073:20:28|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
073:20:30|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're showing you - -
073:20:32|T|CMP|The Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him.
073:20:36|T|CC|Say again, please.
073:20:41|T|CMP|I said the Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him. What can we do for you?
073:20:47|T|CC|Roger. If you don't get in the way of the Czar while he's brushing his teeth, we'd like you to bring up the primary accumulator quantity a little bit. We're showing the quantity now at 20.6 percent on TM. Seems to have gone down a bit since you've gone into the shadow. We'd like it serviced to bring the quantity up to between 30 and 40 percent, preferable 35 percent. Over.
073:21:19|T|CMP|Okay.
073:21:22|T|CC|The computer is yours, 11. The loads are in and verified. You can go back to BLOCK.
073:21:31|T|CMP|We're in BLOCK.
073:23:51|T|CC|11, this is Houston. On the basis of your last P52 alignment, the platform looks like it's indeed performing very well. No problems there, no updates required, and no PIPA bias update is required either. Over.
073:24:11|T|CMP|Sounds good.
073:25:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours, 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is 6,522 nautical miles away from the Moon approaching at a velocity of 4,483 feet per second.
073:40:50|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check.
073:40:54|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Over.
073:41:00|T|CMP|Okay. Just checking. Do you want high-gain?
073:41:06|T|CC|Roger. If you can give it to us.
073:41:11|T|CMP|Okay.
073:42:18|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high-gain?
073:42:22|T|CC|Loud and clear on the high-gain.
073:42:28|T|CMP|Same here. We've completed the P52 option 1.
073:42:36|T|CC|Roger. We've been looking over your shoulder by TM.
073:42:48|T|CMP|Glad to have you.
073:58:38|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Standing by to copy TEI 1 and TEI 4. Over.
073:58:43|T|CC|Roger. I've got the 1 and 4 PAD's here, right now. I'll be ready to read them up to you in just a second.
073:59:31|T|CC|11, this is Houston. I'm ready with the TEI 1 and 4 PAD's. Over.
073:59:44|T|LMP|Ready to copy.
073:59:46|T|CC|Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, TIG, 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041. The balance of the PAD is NA. Ullage; two jets, 19 seconds. TEI-4 PAD, SPS/G&N:, 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, TIG, 084:29:50.59; plus 3137.3, plus 0376.0, minus 0096.8; roll NA, pitch 034. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage; two jets, 19 seconds. Both of these PADs are for an undocked maneuver. TEI-plus-4 PAD assumes no LOI-2. Over. Make that TEI-4 PAD assumes no LOI-2.
074:01:53|T|LMP|Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65; 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041; two jets, 19 seconds; undocked.

074:02:59|T|CC|11, this is Houston - -
074:03:00|T|LMP|- - Apollo 11. Over.
074:03:01|T|CC|- - 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
074:03:22|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin with the readback of that information which was for contingency transearth injection burns if required shortly after Lunar Orbit Insertion.
074:04:23|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
074:04:31|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
074:04:33|T|CC|Roger. At GET of 74:30, we'd like you to cycle the fans in all four CRYO tanks and position the heaters in all four CRYO tanks to the AUTO position. We're doing this in advance of LOI in order to insure that you don't have any destratification as a result of the burn, which might result in giving you a master Caution and Warning during the burn. Over.
074:05:09|T|LMP|Okay. Was that 74:30? You want us to cycle the heaters and turn - cycle the fans and turn all the heaters on.
074:05:16|T|CC|All the heaters to AUTO; cycle the fans at 74:30, about 25 minutes from now. Over.
074:05:24|T|LMP|Okay.
074:08:29|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 8 minutes. Apollo 11 is 4,625 nautical miles away from the Moon. Velocity 4,765 feet per second. We're 1 hour 32 minutes away from loss of signal as Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon, and we're about 1 hour 41 minutes away from the LOI number 1 burn.
074:32:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 32 minutes. Apollo 11 is traveling at a velocity of 3 thousand -  stand by. We've got a static display here.
074:34:46|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
074:34:51|T|CDR|Houston, 11.
074:34:53|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear now.
074:35:12|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11.
074:35:14|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
074:35:22|T|CDR|Apparently this is not a very good OMNI attitude for you. We're ready to start our TVC check.
074:35:54|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're ready, except that we'd like to get the high-gain antenna prior to this test. Over.
074:36:08|T|CMP|Can you give us a couple of pointing angles?
074:36:10|T|CC|Roger. From an attitude with 60 degrees roll, around to an attitude of roll 058 inertial. It would be pitch plus 30 and yaw 270 on the high-gain antenna.
074:36:29|T|CDR|Thank you.
074:51:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
074:51:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
074:51:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
074:51:44|T|CDR|Roger. Loud and clear.
074:51:46|T|CC|Roger. We're reading you weak but clear.
074:51:54|T|CDR|Roger. We put our - our roll for a MSFN track in on the wrong sign. Going to continue rolling around until we get high-gain here. And, we'll delete the - the pitch that was scheduled after the TVC check.
074:52:16|T|CC|Say again please, 11.
074:52:22|T|CDR|Roger. We put the wrong sign in - -
074:52:25|T|CC|Roger.
074:52:25|T|CDR|- - for the roll correction to get MSFN high-gain, and we're continuing rolling around to get the proper attitude for high-gain at this time. We will delete the pitch maneuver that was scheduled subsequent to - subsequent to the TV check since we already have those pictures.
074:52:47|T|CC|Roger. We copy. And we recommend that you go ahead and complete your TVC test onboard. If you have problems, we'll talk to you when you get around further into the high-gain antenna attitude. Over.
074:53:14|T|CDR|Roger.
074:59:01|T|CDR|Houston, how do you read on high-gain?
074:59:04|T|CC|Oh, loud and clear on high-gain, 11.
074:59:09|T|CDR|Roger. We're proceeding.
074:59:11|T|CC|Roger.
075:00:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours into the mission. Apollo 11 is 2,241 nautical miles away from the Moon. Velocity 5,512 feet per second. We're 41 minutes away from loss of signal as Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon. We're 49 minutes away from the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver number 1.
075:03:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We observed your gimbal test down here, and it looked good to us. Over.
075:03:34|T|CDR|Roger. It looked good here.

075:30:54|T|LMP|Roger. GO for LOI.
075:30:56|T|CC|And we're showing about 10 minutes and 30 seconds to LOS. I would like to remind you to enable the BD roll on the AUTO RCS switches. Over.
075:31:10|T|LMP|Roger. And confirm you want PCM low going over the hill. Over.
075:31:19|T|CC|That's affirmative, 11.
075:31:25|T|LMP|Roger.
075:31:40|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin confirming the GO.
075:31:44|T|LMP|If you want to, I'll put it back to high until just before LOS. Over.
075:31:52|T|CC|Negative, 11. Low is okay for now. Over.
075:31:58|T|LMP|Roger.
075:35:55|T|CDR|Houston, do you want to give me a time check, please?

075:49:24|O|CDR|Yes, the moon is there, boy - in all its splendor.
075:49:28|O|CMP|Man, it's a - -
075:49:30|O|CDR|Plaster of paris gray to me.
075:49:32|O|LMP|Man, look at it.
075:49:33|O|CDR|Don't look at it; here we come up - -
075:49:36|O|CMP|Okay.
075:49:37|O|CDR|- - ... to TIG.
075:49:40|O|LMP|8 seconds.
075:49:42|O|CMP|99 -
075:49:44|O|CDR|PROCEED
075:49:46|O|CMP|Stand by for TIG.
075:49:48|O|LMP|Got B mode - -
075:49:50|O|CMP|Burning; we're looking good.
075:49:51|O|LMP|- - A, 
075:49:51|O|CMP|Here comes B - B, I mean, THRUST A -
075:49:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 49 minutes. Apollo 11 should have started this long burn duration 6 minutes, 2 seconds, DELTA V 2,917 feet per second. Given that burn we expect an orbit of 61 by 169.2 nautical miles.
075:49:54|O|CMP|MARK.
075:49:55|O|LMP|Got them.
075:49:56|O|CDR|Got them both? Okay, now what's your - read your chamber pressure?
075:49:58|O|CMP|It's good. 95, 95.
075:50:00|O|LMP|PUGS is oscillating around.
075:50:04|O|CMP|Okay, we're steering.
075:50:13|O|LMP|95 seconds in, it says go DECREASE, and we're ...
075:50:20|O|CMP|You're in pretty good; your gimbals are working a little bit more busily than I would have guessed, but everything's looking good.
075:50:32|O|CDR|EMS and G&N CALS together.
075:50:35|O|CMP|Okay.
075:50:38|O|CMP|Pitch trim is up at 1.5 degrees, cycling about that, which is a little bit off the SIM value. Yaw trim is cycling about zero. Chamber pressure - -
075:50:46|O|LMP|...
075:50:47|O|CMP|- - is 95.
075:50:49|O|LMP|Right, going INCREASE.
075:50:51|O|CMP|Yes, you're into - a minute into it. Yes.
075:50:54|O|CDR|Well, it's still below zero, I just - -
075:50:57|P|PAO|We're 24 and one-half minutes away from acquisition of signal with a good burn. The clock has not yet started counting for the other acquisition time. We'll take this lying down now and come back up just prior to the acquisition in time for no burn. This is Mission Control, Houston.
075:50:57|O|CMP|I'll bet you we're never going to catch up. Let's do it and see what happens.
075:51:08|O|CDR|Okay, that should be gray -
075:51:11|O|CMP|g feels sort of pleasant, doesn't it? We're measuring just a shadow over zero g on the g-meter.
075:51:17|O|CDR|Tank pressures are good.
075:51:19|O|CMP|Okay. The chamber pressure is holding steady as a rock. It's holding - it's building up a little bit, actually; it's up around 96 now. Gimbals are sure a little bit busier than I would have guessed.
075:51:34|O|CDR|That's a little more chamber pressure than they were predicting.
075:51:38|P|PAO|- and we'll stand by.
075:51:42|O|CMP|Yes, they're all plus 95.
075:51:42|O|CDR|We may - -
075:51:43|O|CMP|Shut down a little early.
075:51:44|O|CDR|- - shut down a little early.
075:51:46|O|LMP|What do you think about how this crazy g feels?
075:51:55|O|CMP|All your electricals look okay over there, Buzz?
075:51:57|O|LMP|Man, I'm not going to look at them.
075:51:59|O|CMP|Alright, probably a good rule.
075:52:14|O|CMP|How about that? It's running a couple up.
075:52:15|O|CDR|35 more seconds, and we'll be out of mode 2.
075:52:28|O|LMP|Well, it's more than just - -
075:52:30|O|CMP|Chamber pressure continuing; it's up to about 97 - 98 percent.
075:52:34|O|LMP|- - more than just gray.
075:52:35|O|CMP|Yes, there's a little pinging in there. That might have jammed; keep your arms off the cockpit, ... all day to look at that thing.
075:52:42|O|LMP|Look at that thing; that's just where I want it. What do you think about that? A tad low. We're not going to - catch it - ... creep up. Okay? Pressure is on INCREASE - -
075:53:02|P|PAO|We're passed the no-burn acquisition time now, and we have received no signal.
075:53:03|O|CDR|Tank pressures are still good.
075:53:05|O|LMP|- - ... at the beginning.
075:53:06|O|CMP|Chamber pressure - -
075:53:07|O|LMP|Take a look at this.
075:53:08|O|CMP|- - is holding. Wandering off a little bit in roll; that's to be expected. Coming back.
075:53:22|O|LMP|Okay - -
075:53:23|O|CDR|We're well into mode 3.
075:53:24|O|LMP|- - it's going to be about 3 seconds early - cutoff.
075:53:29|O|CMP|Alright, cut-off nominal at 06:02; expect cut-off around 6 minutes even then, huh?
075:53:36|O|LMP|...
075:53:41|O|CMP|Okay, the rates. We're ... all three axes are about 0.1 degree per second. APS is punting back and forth.
075:53:47|P|PAO|It's very quiet here in the control room. Most of the controllers seated at their consoles, a few standing up, but very quiet.
075:53:51|O|CDR|I'm predicting 05:58.
075:53:54|O|CMP|Okay.
075:53:55|O|CDR|4 seconds early.
075:53:57|O|CMP|Right now.
075:53:59|O|CDR|May be - might be 5 by the time I get my ...
075:54:05|O|CMP|Okay, she's steering like a champ; chamber pressure sneaking up to 100.
075:54:10|O|CDR|Look at the ...
075:54:11|O|CMP|..., didn't recognize it ....
075:54:23|O|CMP|Pitch trim is holding a little over 2; it's oscillating between 2 and 2.4, roughly. Yaw trim is oscillating between minus 0.5 and zero. It's just sort of aimlessly wandering back and forth between those values. Rates are still wandering; they're deadbanding the rates in all three axes; they're plus or minus 0.1 a degree.
075:54:53|O|CDR|We're now predicting 5 seconds early, 05:57.
075:54:57|O|CMP|Chamber pressure is 100 psi even.
075:55:11|O|CMP|Ball number 1 and ball number 2 both right on their values. Roll zero, pitch 225, roughly, and yaw 348; and holding.
075:55:23|P|PAO|We're 7 minutes from acquisition time.
075:55:29|O|LMP|Okay, going to get the DELTA-V switches OFF right at shutdown?
075:55:35|O|CMP|Shutdown, I'll get both DELTA-V THRUST, NORMAL switches, OFF.
075:55:39|O|CDR|10 seconds.
075:55:40|O|CMP|Okay. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, - -
075:55:49|O|MS|...
075:55:50|O|CDR|Okay.
075:55:50|O|CMP|SHUTDOWN. Okay, now.
075:55:50|O|LMP|Ball valves closed - -
075:55:51|O|CMP|50 seconds.
075:55:52|O|LMP|- - barber poles - -
075:55:53|O|CMP|Okay.
075:55:53|O|LMP|All four. Standing by for the gimbal motors.
075:55:55|O|CMP|Alright. PITCH 1 - OFF.
075:55:57|O|LMP|Got it.
075:55:58|O|CMP|YAW 1, OFF.
075:56:00|O|LMP|Got it.
075:56:01|O|CMP|PITCH 2, OFF.
075:56:03|O|LMP|Got it.
075:56:03|O|CMP|YAW 2, OFF.
075:56:05|O|LMP|Got it.
075:56:06|O|CMP|Okay.

075:56:09|O|CMP|1, OFF; 2, OFF.
075:56:11|O|LMP|MAIN BUS TIE is OFF.
075:56:12|O|CMP|Okay.
075:56:13|O|LMP|1, OFF; 2, OFF.
075:56:16|O|CMP|Man, man!
075:56:16|O|LMP|Alright.
075:56:17|O|CDR|Understand.
075:56:18|O|LMP|Look at the residuals. PROCEED.
075:56:20|O|CMP|PROCEED? Copy them down; we're not going to trim them.
075:56:24|O|CMP|Good job! Look at that ...
075:56:25|O|CDR|... minus 1, minus 1, plus 1.
075:56:26|O|CMP|Jesus!
075:56:27|P|PAO|If Apollo 11 achieved only a partial burn, we could receive a signal any time so we'll continue to stay up until acquisition time of 76 hours, 15 minutes, 29 seconds.
075:56:28|O|LMP|Got them.
075:56:29|O|CMP|I take back any bad things I ever said about MIT. - which I never have.
075:56:34|O|CDR|Okay, will you just leave them, now? They vary around.
075:56:36|O|LMP|Alright, get the EMS, too.
075:56:38|O|CMP|Okay, EMS says minus 6.8.
075:56:40|O|LMP|Got it. You got them on the ... switches?
075:56:44|O|CMP|Minus 6.8 to the DELTA-V to B.
075:56:46|O|LMP|... Flight Plan.
075:56:48|O|LMP|Alright, no nulling residuals. EMS FUNCTION to OFF, we got that ...?
075:56:53|O|CMP|1 minute - Neil's got it. We got it, minus 6.8. Okay, stand by on OFF on EMS. What else you got, Buzz, in the way of a checklist?
075:57:03|P|PAO|And, that time is the initial acquisition time, but it could take a little longer to lock on to the signal for voice communications.
075:57:04|O|LMP|The EMS MODE, STANDBY?
075:57:05|O|CMP|STANDBY.
075:57:06|O|LMP|BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 2?
075:57:07|O|CMP|Three to RATE 2.
075:57:08|O|LMP|ATT DEADBAND, MAX?
075:57:09|O|CMP|ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
075:57:10|O|LMP|PCM BIT RATE, LOW?
075:57:13|O|LMP|ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, two of them, OFF?
075:57:14|O|CMP|DIRECT, two, is OFF.
075:57:15|O|LMP|Circuit breakers - PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN.
075:57:17|O|CMP|PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN. Proceed.
075:57:21|O|LMP|Okay, proceed. Okay, VERB 82 in there. Go to P00. Well, that isn't what it says, but -
075:57:30|O|CMP|Well, it's good.
075:57:45|O|CDR|I think we're going to have to - Well, we'll leave this here anyway ... magazine ...
075:57:47|O|CDR|What goes in this VGX column?
075:57:52|O|CMP|That was the - that's the VGX residual at – before you spin.
075:58:00|O|CDR|Okay.
075:58:01|O|CMP|So just read the ... A.
075:58:03|O|CDR|Alright.
075:58:10|O|CDR|That was a beautiful burn.
075:58:11|O|CMP|God damn, I guess. Whoo! Well, I have to vote with the 10 crew, that thing is brown.
075:58:18|O|CDR|Yes.
075:58:19|O|CMP|Sure is.
075:58:20|O|CDR|Looks tan to me. But when I first saw it, at the other sun angle - -
075:58:24|P|PAO|We are 4 minutes away now.
075:58:24|O|CDR|Yes?
075:58:25|O|CMP|It looked gray.
075:58:26|O|CDR|- - it really looked gray.
075:58:26|O|CMP|Beautiful.
075:58:26|O|LMP|More - more sun angle you get - -
075:58:27|O|CDR|It got more - 
075:58:28|O|CDR|More brown - with increasing sun angle.
075:58:34|O|CMP|Okay.
075:58:35|O|LMP|It's a long ways off.
075:58:36|O|CDR|Alright, let's - Okay, now we've got some things to do -
075:58:42|O|LMP|Okay, let's do them.
075:58:46|O|CDR|We got to do a VERB 66.
075:58:50|O|LMP|Okay, wait a minute - alright.
075:58:52|O|CMP|Buzz will want to do a VERB 82; now, I don't know what comes first here.
075:58:54|O|LMP|Yes, VERB 82.
075:59:07|O|CMP|Well, I don't know if we're 60 miles or not, but at least we haven't hit that mother.
075:59:10|P|PAO|There are a few conversations taking place here in the control room, but not very many. Most of the people are sitting quietly, watching and listening. Not talking.
075:59:10|O|LMP|Look at that! Look at that! 169.6 by 60.9.
075:59:14|O|CMP|Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
075:59:16|O|LMP|What - what'd it say - -
075:59:17|O|CMP|You want to write that down or something?
075:59:19|O|LMP|- - 60.2.
075:59:20|O|CMP|Write it down just for the hell of it. 170 by 60, like gangbusters.
075:59:27|O|LMP|We only missed by a couple of tenths of a mile.
075:59:35|O|CMP|Hello, Moon; how's your old back side?
075:59:40|O|CDR|Well, it's - -
075:59:41|O|CDR|VERB 66, alright?
075:59:42|O|LMP|VERB 66.
075:59:46|O|CDR|We won't need that other vector ever again.
075:59:48|O|LMP|Now, we're - PCM, LOW, and we want to turn the TAPE RECORDER, OFF?
075:59:51|O|CMP|Yes, why not - I don't care.
075:59:53|O|LMP|Okay.
075:59:53|O|CMP|Why don't you go PCM, LOW, and don't worry about the tape recorder; it's got 2 hours.
075:59:57|O|LMP|Okay.
075:59:57|O|CDR|Okay, we'll look at Service Module RCS - and SCS -
076:00:06|O|CMP|I want to look at the DAP again and enter a VERB 48, ENTER.
076:00:14|O|LMP|What was our ...?
076:00:15|O|CDR|1500.
076:00:24|O|CMP|Okay.
076:00:26|O|LMP|You got all your things logged now?
076:00:29|O|CMP|Yes, sir, I'm all logged.
076:00:31|O|LMP|Okay.
076:00:33|O|CDR|Now, it says what we do is roll 180 and pitch down 70.
076:00:38|O|LMP|Let's do it.
076:00:39|O|CMP|Alrighty, let's go to SCS and do it.
076:00:44|O|CDR|And -
076:00:45|P|PAO|That noise is just bring up the system. We have not acquired a signal.
076:00:52|O|LMP|Don't waste all the gas, now.
076:00:54|P|PAO|We're a minute and one-half away from acquisition time.
076:00:54|O|CMP|... When I get around there, I'll pitch down 70, huh? What are we pitching down for, what, what, what - -
076:01:01|O|CDR|We're going to - what we're - -
076:01:02|O|CMP|I don't even know what we're doing.
076:01:03|O|CDR|Well, we're going to (laughter) - we're going to roll over and pitch down so we're looking out the front windows, down at the - -
076:01:09|O|CMP|Oh, yes, okay.
076:01:10|O|CDR|Okay?
076:01:11|O|CMP|We can pitch down - ... picture - -

076:01:12|O|CMP|- - can we take a picture - -
076:01:13|O|LMP|- - ... pitch attitude.
076:01:14|O|CMP|Yes.
076:01:15|O|CDR|Now, we're going to have high-gain, and then we're - -
076:01:17|O|CMP|How would you - -
076:01:17|O|CDR|- - going to be able to - -
076:01:17|O|CMP|- - like it with the - -
076:01:18|O|CDR|- - look at the moon ahead of us, coming out the window right now.
076:01:20|O|CMP|Can we see the Earth rising from there?
076:01:22|O|LMP|Well, we ... - -
076:01:23|O|CDR|We should be able to ...
076:01:24|O|LMP|- - ... precise. What was the time we got on it, Neil?
076:01:27|O|CDR|Yes, we can - -
076:01:29|O|LMP|Neil?
076:01:30|O|CDR|What's that?
076:01:31|O|LMP|What was the time we got on it?

076:01:38|O|LMP|No, no - -
076:01:40|O|LMP|We want the big camera, huh? Big lens or small one?
076:01:44|O|CDR|Oh, it doesn't really matter.
076:01:46|O|CMP|80 millimeter will probably be as good for - -

076:01:53|P|PAO|30 seconds.
076:01:54|O|CMP|- - might take some - some luck to get that, but - -

076:03:09|O|CMP|Whoo.
076:03:09|O|LMP|You might get it coming sideways here; stand by in case it does. What's the AOS time?
076:03:14|O|LMP|It was 15 with the burn. 15:23, something like that.
076:03:22|O|CMP|Just be with you in 10 seconds, Neil; I just want to get my - -

076:03:48|O|CDR|Coming up there.
076:03:51|O|LMP|... Eyeballing and chattering. We got the burn status report? That's all?
076:04:02|O|CMP|Ready to go.

076:04:32|O|CDR|Yes, I think I've got one. Here you go.
076:04:39|O|LMP|Here's one; it's a little moist, though.
076:04:42|O|CMP|...
076:04:48|O|CMP|Well, one more fiddle'n burn.
076:04:52|O|LMP|Two more.
076:04:57|O|CDR|You got two more.
076:04:59|O|CMP|Yes, ... got a few more.
076:05:02|O|LMP|Look at those craters in a row. You see them right - going right out there?
076:05:07|O|CDR|...
076:05:08|O|LMP|Look at that line of them.
076:05:09|O|CDR|...
076:05:12|O|CMP|...
076:05:14|O|LMP|Something really peppered that one. There's a lot less variation in color than I would have thought, you know, looking down?
076:05:26|O|CMP|Yes, but when you look down, you say it's brownish color?
076:05:28|O|LMP|Sure.
076:05:31|O|CMP|Oh, god, hey, let me have that camera back. There's a huge, magnificent crater over here. I wish we had the other lens on, but god, that's a big beauty. You want to look at that guy, Neil?
076:05:43|O|CDR|Yes, I see him.
076:05:45|O|LMP|He's coming your way.
076:05:47|O|CDR|That dark spot.
076:05:49|O|LMP|Oh, let me - here, let me - -
076:05:52|O|LMP|Well, there's no doubt that this is a little smaller than the Earth - -
076:05:55|O|LMP|Look at that one.
076:05:55|O|LMP|- - would you look at that curvature?
076:05:59|O|LMP|Where is that dark spot?
076:06:00|O|CMP|The dark spot's right up here.
076:06:03|O|LMP|You want to get the other lens on?
076:06:05|O|CMP|Yes.
076:06:07|O|LMP|Don't you want to get the Earth coming up? It's going to be 9 minutes.
076:06:10|O|CMP|Yes, let's take some pictures here, first.
076:06:14|O|LMP|Well, don't miss that first one.
076:06:15|O|CMP|See how am I doing. Yes, you're right.
076:06:20|O|CDR|We'll need - we need to catch it about 10.
076:06:27|O|LMP|Shoot, you're going to have plenty of passes.
076:06:29|O|CMP|Yes, right.
076:06:32|O|LMP|Plenty of earthrises, I guess.
076:06:36|O|CMP|Yes, we are.
076:06:37|O|LMP|Are we about there?
076:06:40|O|CDR|Boy, look at that little crater. You can probably see him right there.
076:06:42|O|LMP|Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.
076:07:05|O|CMP|Hope none of those meteors come by right now.
076:07:17|O|CMP|Let me look through the sextant, Neil.
076:07:41|O|CMP|Well, where's the frappin' Earth going to be now? I'm confused (laughter).
076:07:46|O|LMP|In plane, I hope.
076:07:49|O|CDR|How are you doing on your roll there?
076:07:51|O|LMP|Well, we got about another 60 degrees to go. When's AOS?
076:08:00|O|CDR|15 - we're 7 minutes away.
076:08:02|O|LMP|Okay.
076:08:37|O|CDR|What a spectacular view!
076:08:48|O|CMP|God, look at that moon!
076:09:19|O|CMP|Fantastic!
076:09:23|O|CDR|Look back there behind us, sure looks like a gigantic crater; look at the mountains going around it. My gosh, they're monsters.
076:09:57|O|CDR|See that real big - -
076:09:59|O|CMP|Yes, there's a moose down here you just wouldn't believe. There's the biggest one yet. God, it's huge! It is enormous! It's so big I can't even get it in the window. Jesus. You want to look at that? That's the biggest one you'll ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.
076:10:22|O|MS|...
076:10:23|O|CMP|Isn't that a huge one?
076:10:25|O|CDR|Look at the ... Did you get some pictures of that?
076:10:27|O|CMP|Yes, I just took one. Can take another one here when he gets around a little better. It's fantastic!
076:10:35|O|CDR|That's kind of a foggy window.
076:10:36|O|CMP|That's a horrible window. It's too bad we have to shoot through this one, but - Oh, boy, you could spend a lifetime just geologizing that one crater alone, you know that?
076:10:49|O|CDR|You could.
076:10:51|O|CMP|That's not how I'd like to spend my lifetime, but - picture that. Beautiful!
076:11:00|O|LMP|Yes, there's a big mother over here, too.
076:11:06|O|CMP|Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers; give them some scientific name. (laughter)
076:11:15|O|LMP|It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.
076:11:19|O|CMP|A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.
076:11:25|O|LMP|Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?
076:11:40|O|LMP|That is, the older they get.
076:11:49|O|CMP|Well, we're at 180 degrees -
076:11:53|O|CDR|Okay, now we're going to want to stop that and start a slow pitchdown. We want to go - -
076:11:58|O|LMP|We're not going to see the Earth come up over the horizon.
076:12:01|O|CDR|- - about 70 degrees.
076:12:02|O|CMP|It says pitchdown or pitchup?
076:12:03|O|CDR|Pitchdown, so we're looking forward.
076:12:05|O|CMP|Pitchdown, so we're looking forward, alright. I wonder what kind of a rate we ought to - -
076:12:10|O|LMP|We got 4 minutes to get there.
076:12:12|O|CMP|Alright.
076:12:13|O|LMP|We'll never make it. There's a couple of new craters.
076:12:24|O|CDR|There's a good view of that -
076:12:28|O|LMP|Look warm down there, Neil?
076:12:32|O|CDR|I sure can't tell.
076:12:35|O|LMP|Looks hotter than hell to me. Boy, look at the size of that one.
076:12:46|O|CMP|Golly! Beautiful!
076:12:49|O|CDR|Get another picture of that big fellow.
076:12:50|O|CDR|Yes. I'm going to take one out here of him.
076:12:58|O|LMP|I've got an Easter egg coming up, gentlemen.
076:13:01|O|CDR|That's good. Gosh, it's 1 o'clock already.
076:13:06|O|LMP|Hey, you know, we got a TV show at -
076:13:13|O|MS|...
076:13:14|O|CMP|Huh?
076:13:15|O|CDR|The next REV around, that is.
076:13:17|O|LMP|Before LOI-2.
076:13:19|O|CDR|Yes.
076:13:23|O|CMP|Could you give me a gimbal angle to pitch to?
076:13:26|O|CDR|What are you going to do on that one?
076:13:28|O|CDR|Oh, I guess - get 10 pictures of the Moon.
076:13:35|O|LMP|What did you want, Mike?
076:13:38|O|CMP|A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?
076:13:53|O|LMP|Yes, you were at 2 -
076:13:57|O|CMP|296, I would guess. How many minutes we got – to AOS?
076:14:07|O|CDR|About another minute and a half.
076:14:07|O|LMP|(Coughing)
076:14:16|O|CMP|I rolled to slow - 
076:14:18|O|CDR|Doubt that we'll make it. Oh, look what I got. ...
076:14:32|O|CMP|Golly damn! A geologist up here would just go crazy.
076:14:39|O|LMP|You want the Flight Plan?
076:14:43|O|CDR|Yes, please.
076:14:56|O|CMP|Okay, we shouldn't take any more pictures on this roll until Earth comes, I don't think; this is - -
076:15:01|O|CDR|About out?
076:15:02|O|CMP|- - just about out and it's on our last color roll, so we'll switch to black and white as soon as we get to Earth.
076:15:06|O|CDR|We might make it in time.
076:15:08|O|CMP|Yes.
076:15:12|O|LMP|There it is, it's coming up!
076:15:14|O|CMP|What?
076:15:15|O|LMP|The Earth.
076:15:16|O|CDR|See it?
076:15:16|O|LMP|Yes.
076:15:18|O|LMP|Beautiful.
076:15:21|O|LMP|It's halfway up.
076:15:23|O|CMP|We ought to have AOS now.
076:15:24|O|CDR|You got your - -
076:15:25|O|LMP|Right over the LM.
076:15:27|O|CDR|Are you set up?
076:15:29|O|LMP|Just about to be cut off by the LM. Boy, does that ever look beautiful in the sextant.
076:15:36|O|CMP|Have you got - -
076:15:37|O|CDR|Okay, how about MSFN -
076:15:39|O|LMP|You got it
076:15:42|O|CDR|We're in OMNI - -
076:15:44|O|LMP|DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
076:15:45|O|CDR|- - Bravo.
076:15:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
076:15:47|O|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
076:15:51|O|LMP|Yes, we sure do, Houston. The LOI 1 burn just nominal as all getout, and everything's looking good.
076:16:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read?
076:16:00|O|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11 - -
076:16:11|T|SC|...
076:16:58|T|SC|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
076:17:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We are reading you weakly. Go ahead. Over.
076:17:09|T|CDR|Roger. Burn status report follows. DELTA-TIG zero, burn time 557, ... VGX minus 0.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ plus 0.1, DELTA-VC minus 0 ..., fuel 390, plus 38 ... 42. Over.
076:17:44|T|CC|11, this is Houston. These residuals, do you have minus 0.1 ... VGX minus 0.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ plus 0.1, and a burn time of 5 plus 57. Stand by, maybe the COMM will improve a little bit. Over.
076:19:32|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you in the process of acquiring with the high-gain antenna? Over.
076:21:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read?
076:21:44|T|CDR|Reading you loud and clear, Houston. How us?
076:21:46|T|CC|Roger. Reading you the same, now. Could you repeat your burn status report? We copied the residuals and burn time, and that was about it. Send the whole thing again, please.
076:21:56|T|CMP|It was like - it was like perfect!
076:22:01|T|CDR|DELTA-TIG zero, burn time 5:57, shaft value on the angles, VGX minus 0.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ plus 0.1, no trim, minus 6.8 on DELTA-VC, fuel was 38.8, LOX 39.0, plus 50 on balance, and we ran an increase on the PUGS, NOUN 44 showed us in a 60.9 by 169.9.
076:22:35|T|CC|Roger. We copy your burn status report. And the spacecraft is looking good to us on telemetry.
076:22:48|T|CDR|Roger. Everything looks good up here.
076:23:00|P|PAO|That burn report was by Neil Armstrong.
076:27:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're showing spacecraft weight in lunar orbit of 72,004 pounds.
076:34:34|T|CDR|Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. At this time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and one on TV. There's no substitute for actually being there.
076:35:11|T|CC|Roger. We concur, and we certainly wish we could see it firsthand, also.
076:35:23|P|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
076:35:33|T|CDR|We're going over the Messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and Messier A we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. I don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks.
076:35:56|T|CC|Okay. Just roughly, it looks like you are about 120 miles or 13O miles right now - make that 127 miles.
076:37:14|T|CDR|We're approaching PDI point now. Over.
076:37:24|T|CDR|There's Secchi in sight.
076:37:49|T|LMP|We're going over Mount Marilyn at the present time, and it's ignition point.
076:37:55|T|CC|Roger. Thank you. And our preliminary tracking data for the first few minutes shows you in a 61.6 by 169.5 orbit. Over.
076:38:11|T|LMP|Roger.
076:38:13|T|CC|And Jim is smiling.
076:41:29|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
076:41:35|T|CDR|Go ahead.
076:41:37|T|CC|11, Houston. During your SPS burn as played back on tape down here, we've observed the nitrogen tank Bravo pressure in the SPS system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. It's holding steady right now. We'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. Over.
076:42:03|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
076:42:05|T|CC|Oh - and it has held steady - -
076:42:06|T|CDR|Currently going over Maskelyne Mas -
076:42:10|T|CDR|Okay.
076:42:11|T|CDR|And Boothill, Duke Island, Sidewinder, looking at Maskelyne W, that's the yaw around checkpoint, and just coming into the terminator. At the terminator it's ashen gray. As you get farther away from the terminator, it gets to be a lighter gray, and as you get closer to the subsolar point, you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground, according to the ... limited observation, anyway.
076:42:49|T|CC|Roger, 11. We're recording your comments for posterity.
076:42:57|T|CDR|(Laughter) Okay.
076:43:01|P|PAO|And again, that was Neil Armstrong with the report.
076:43:04|T|CMP|Did somebody in the background - do they accuse us of being compromisers?
076:43:07|T|CC|Huh!
076:43:19|T|CDR|And landing site is well into the dark here. I don't think we're going to be able to see anything of the landing site this early.
076:43:42|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you have a free minute, could you give us your onboard readout of N2 tank Bravo, please. And we'd like to make sure you understand that ever since you stopped thrusting with the SPS, the temperature in this tank has remained steady. Over. Make that the pressure has remained steady.
076:44:07|T|CMP|Rog. We understand tank pressure has stayed steady. Thank you.
076:44:13|T|LMP|Roger. We're showing the N2 tank pressure and the tank Bravo to he 1960, something like that, and Alfa is, oh, about 22 - about 2250. Over.
076:44:34|T|CC|Roger. We show 2249 in Alfa and 1946 down here.
076:44:44|T|LMP|Okay.
076:53:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with some roll, pitch, and yaw angles in which to stop this so called ORB RATE that I'm doing.
076:53:29|T|CC|Roger. Standby.
076:53:46|T|CC|We'll have them for you in a minute, 11.
076:53:52|T|CMP|Okay. And time to stop also, please.
076:53:55|T|CC|Yes, indeed.
076:56:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
076:56:41|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
076:56:43|T|CC|Roger. We show you, in the Flight Plan, staying in orbital rate until about 79 hours 10 minutes. Do you have some particular attitude or reason for wanting to go inertial? Over.
076:57:01|T|CMP|No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79:10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.
076:57:07|T|CC|Roger. And we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus. Over.
076:57:28|T|LMP|Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is, oh, pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus.
076:57:55|T|CC|- - Okay.
076:57:55|T|CC|We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -
076:57:56|T|CC|Aristarchus is at Tango Echo 9 on your ATO chart. It's about 394 miles north of track. However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. And, take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.
076:58:34|T|CDR|Both looking.
076:58:36|T|CC|Roger. Out.
076:59:14|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin discussing the earthshine.
077:03:01|T|CDR|Houston, 11. It might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing of 45 west.
077:03:09|T|CC|Say again, please, 11.
077:03:23|T|CDR|You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.
077:03:33|T|CC|Roger. You'll be crossing 45 west at 77:04:10 or about 40 seconds from now. Over. Thirty seconds from now.
077:03:46|T|CDR|Okay.
077:04:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, when we lose the S-band, we'd like to get OMNI Charlie from you. And update my last, that 77:04 was the time when Aristarchus should become visible over your horizon. 77:12 is point of closest approach south of it. Over.
077:05:14|T|CDR|Okay. That sounds better because we just went by Copernicus a little bit ago.
077:05:19|T|CC|Roger. We show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now.
077:05:25|T|CDR|Righto.
077:07:07|T|LMP|Houston, when a star sets up here, there's no doubt about it. One instant it's there, and the next instant it's just completely gone.
077:07:16|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
077:09:20|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We request you select OMNI Charlie at this time. Over.
077:09:30|T|LMP|Okay. Going to OMNI Charlie.
077:09:32|T|CC|Roger. Out.
077:11:57|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
077:12:01|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
077:12:07|T|LMP|Roger. Seems to me, since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...
077:12:32|T|CC|Roger.
077:12:51|T|CDR|Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.
077:13:29|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy.
077:14:23|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if I'm lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it at about a zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.
077:15:15|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.
077:15:33|T|CMP|Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.
077:15:42|T|CMP|No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.
077:15:47|T|CC|Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?
077:16:00|T|LMP|Well, I guess it would be the inner edge of the west-northwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.
077:16:19|T|CC|11, Houston. Have you used the monocular on this? Over.
077:16:28|T|CMP|Stand by one.
077:17:59|T|CMP|Roger. Like you to know this quest for science has caused me to lose my lunch. It's supposed to be around here somewhere, but I can't find it.
077:18:08|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're - we're hearing only a partial COMM. Say again please.
077:18:18|T|CMP|I think ...
077:18:41|T|LMP|Houston, we will give it a try if we have the opportunity on next pass, when we are not in the middle of lunch, and trying to find the monocular.
077:18:52|T|CC|Roger. Copied you that time. Expect in the next REV you will probably be getting ready for LOI-2.
077:19:07|T|CC|So, let's wind this up, and since we've got some other things to talk to you about in a few minutes. Over.
077:19:19|T|LMP|Okay.
077:19:49|P|PAO|Apollo 11 will be in acquisition for another 20 minutes during its first revolution of the Moon.
077:22:43|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
077:22:49|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
077:22:52|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're targeting - planning to make the LOI-2 burn now using bank A only. We'll have the PAD and everything for you next time around. Just trying to economize a little on bank B. Bank B is holding, though.
077:23:15|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
077:23:17|T|CC|Capcom -
077:31:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
077:32:02|T|CDR|Go ahead.
077:32:04|T|CC|11, Houston. In order to improve the communications a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high-gain antenna. We're recommending a pitch angle of 0, yaw 355 - I say again 355, the track switch to MANUAL, and wide beam-width. Over.
077:32:41|T|LMP|Okay. You ready to switch to high-gain now?
077:32:44|T|CC|That's affirmative.
077:33:08|T|CC|11, Houston. Do you read?
077:33:18|T|LMP|Roger. We read you. It seems to be rather marginal on the high-gain.
077:33:24|T|CC|Roger. We concur.
077:33:41|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a time of crossing the prime meridian 150 west? Over.
077:33:47|T|CC|Roger. Stand by about a half a second, here. Okay. Your time of crossing the 150 west meridian will be 77:50:05. Over.
077:34:09|T|CMP|Thank you.
077:34:23|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We have about 6 minutes remaining until LOS, and in order that we may configure our ground lines, we'd like to know if you're still planning to have the TV up with the beginning of the next pass. Over.
077:34:47|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. We'll try to have it ready.
077:34:50|T|CC|This is Houston. We are inquiring if it is your plan to. Over.
077:35:00|T|CDR|It never was our plan to; but it's in the Flight Plan, so I guess we'll do it.
077:35:05|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
077:35:46|T|CC|11, Houston.
077:35:53|T|CDR|Roger. Go ahead.
077:35:54|T|CC|For use in connection with that time on the prime meridian crossing, you have an orbital period now of 2 hours 8 minutes and 37 seconds. Over.
077:36:10|T|CMP|Thank you.
077:36:11|T|CC|Roger. Out.
077:38:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. A little over 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems parameters and orbit are looking good from the ground. We have AOS on the other side at 78:23:31. Over.
077:38:40|T|CDR|Roger. 78:23:21.
077:38:43|T|CC|Roger. That was 31 on the end.
077:38:51|T|CDR|Okay.
077:40:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal from Apollo 11 on its first lunar revolution. We will acquire the spacecraft on the next revolution at 78 hours 23 minutes 31 seconds. The orbital period for Apollo 11's present orbit: 2 hours 8 minutes 37 seconds. And, as you heard we passed up to the crew information that we would perform the LOI-2 burn using only bank A. The banks are the drive mechanisms for the ball valves in the Service Propulsion System. They open and close these ball valves. The valves allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the engine. There are redundant valves and redundant banks, banks A and B. There was apparently - they are driven by nitrogen and that was the reference to the pressure drop there. It was apparently a leak in nitrogen tank B during the LOI 1 burn. This burn was performed with both banks open. The engine can be operated with only one bank. It's apparent that the tank leaked only during the burn while the bank was actuated. Pressure has held steady since the end of the burn and the experts are reducing the data and looking at the leak rate, determining whether it was constant throughout the burn, what - precisely what the situation is. We're showing pressure in tank B of 1960 psi. In tank A 2250 psi. Both of these are well above the red lines of 400 pounds psi.
077:41:16|O|LMP|That's why I'm trying to get it out.
077:42:16|O|LMP|No alignment this REV, huh?
077:43:02|O|LMP|Mike, I guess the name of the game is to go back to - B OMNI?
077:43:10|O|CMP|Huh?
077:43:13|O|LMP|Go back to B in OMNI?
077:43:18|O|CMP|Well, let's see - when we come over the hill next time, we're supposed to have them on the high-gain, I think.
077:43:25|O|LMP|Not sure of that.
077:43:29|O|CMP|...
077:43:31|O|CMP|Did you use this thing?
077:43:33|O|CDR|No.
077:43:34|O|LMP|Well, let's get rid of it then; I can't see a crapping ...
077:44:26|O|LMP|77:44 - okay, - LOS is right on schedule.
077:44:36|O|CMP|77:50, we'll be at the prime meridian; now, I can set that map up so it'll tell us where we are.
077:44:43|O|CDR|Okay.
077:44:45|O|CMP|Geez, we're ahead on this eat period - we're behind on the last eat period or something. We got a ...
077:45:16|O|CMP|I think, Buzz, if you put - put the high-gain to MANUAL and go pitch 20 - yaw 360 - pitch minus 20, I guess - -
077:45:26|O|LMP|Minus 20; yes, that would be better.
077:45:28|O|CMP|- - and yaw 360 - That's okay assuming I'm at the right attitude, but I ain't going to be at the right attitude - not without wasting a lot of gas. Put -
077:45:36|O|LMP|That's fine, but -
077:45:42|O|CDR|If you did, it would be very interesting that way.
077:45:46|O|CMP|Yes. Oh, crap.
077:45:55|O|LMP|We get high-gain and we get TV at the same time - -
077:45:58|O|CMP|Well, I better start maneuvering then; doggone it, I've been yawed out of plane somehow. Let's see, we're pitched down - we want to pitch back up - pitched down, doggone it. ACCEL COMMAND, pitch down.
077:46:17|O|CDR|Okay, well, are we going to unlock the camera store and get all that claptrap put together?
077:46:23|O|LMP|Yes.
077:46:24|O|CDR|Okay.
077:46:42|O|LMP|Which window you want to operate out of, so I can figure out how to put the monitor on?
077:46:48|O|CDR|Well, I suppose the best one would be the center window, don't you think?
077:46:57|O|LMP|Probably, I don't know; wait until we get into attitude.
077:47:00|O|CDR|Get into attitude - see what we think.
077:48:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 77 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Here in Mission Control Center, Houston we're at the process of changing shifts. Cliff Charlesworth Green Team of Flight Controllers very shortly will be leaving their consoles. Meanwhile, Apollo 11 passing over the far side of the Moon out of acquisition. Our last orbital parameter readings on our flight dynamics orbital digital displays indicated an apogee of 168.5 nautical miles, a perilune of 1 - correction, a perilune of 61.2 nautical miles. We're currently planning a change-of-shift briefing at approximately 2:30 Central Daylight Time or soon thereafter as is practicable. The change-of-shift briefing will include only our Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth. It's expected to be of short duration since we will have a TV pass soon after the reacquisition of the spacecraft. At 77 hours, 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
077:48:19|O|CMP|Oh, shit; this pitch here is no good; 32, huh? Pitch 315 I want to be at, huh? Alright. They keep - all they do is they say ORB rate and that little attitude right there and right there applies to the rest of this page, all of that page, and over to this page.
077:48:46|O|CDR|Okay, so that's the one we'll do.
077:48:50|O|CMP|Okay, that's the way I'm rolling.
077:48:51|O|CDR|And we'll take the - we'll have high-gain - -
077:48:54|O|CMP|Yes.
077:48:55|O|CDR|- - and we'll get the camera out of the center window, if that looks reasonable.
077:49:02|O|CMP|Okay.
077:49:06|O|CDR|We'll have to give them pictures of the moon.
077:49:07|O|CMP|... I've been plotting on them ... 50:05.
077:49:14|O|CDR|We'll have a gouge as to where we are.
077:49:22|O|CMP|55 -
077:50:33|O|LMP|Outside, huh? Alright, the switch is set for outside.
077:50:40|O|CMP|Could I have that map that y'all were looking at before, that lunar map? Thank you.
077:51:03|O|CDR|Hmm - here comes the moon.
077:51:16|O|LMP|Really beautiful.
077:51:29|O|CDR|Hey, you - -
077:51:29|O|CMP|I wonder where we are.
077:51:31|O|CDR|- - we're going to stop here pretty soon, right?
077:51:33|O|CMP|Yes, at 315.
077:51:41|O|SC|(Whistling)
077:51:56|O|CMP|Man, that's really -
077:51:58|O|CDR|It really looks gray to me now.
077:52:07|O|CDR|That was you?
077:52:09|O|LMP|... right down toward the ground here.
078:03:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 2
078:18:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 78 hours, 18 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 still passing around the far side of the Moon. We are less than 5 minutes now away from time of acquisition on this, the second revolution for Apollo 11. The station to acquire on this pass will be the Goldstone wing site which will feed the television to Mission Control Center, Houston, and thence to all parts of the country. We would expect to come up with television perhaps some several minutes after acquisition since we must first lock up on the downlink and have the scan converter in full operation. So at 78 hours, 19 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
078:21:21|P|PAO|Mark 2 minutes now from time of predicted acquisition in Mission Control Center. We are standing by.
078:22:20|P|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of predicted acquisition. Continuing to stand by in Mission Control Center in Houston.
078:22:10|O|CDR|- - and you could be busy getting us some high-gain when we get ... About a minute from AOS.
078:22:17|O|LMP|Okay, let's get out of this; let me get VERB 62. Okay, Mike?
078:22:21|O|CMP|Oh, I really need these ... Buzz; I really need these god damned guys.
078:22:26|O|LMP|Well, we're not going to have much of a TV unless we get high-gain.
078:22:28|O|CMP|Alright.
078:22:29|O|LMP|I'll give it back to you - ...
078:22:50|O|CDR|Get yourself some rates going about like what you want.
078:22:53|O|CMP|You got - you got high-gain right now, I mean the angles, right now.
078:22:59|O|CMP|And we're 23 - we're 30 seconds from AOS, so those angles should be okay. You reading them?
078:23:07|O|CMP|Minus 30 pitch - -
078:23:10|O|LMP|Yes.
078:23:09|O|CMP|- - 150 yaw, okay.
078:23:11|P|PAO|Mark. 10 seconds away now.
078:23:11|O|LMP|No, that's not 150 - that's 15. Isn't it?
078:23:14|O|CDR|Just a second. Yes, minus - I'm sorry, minus 31 and plus 15. Right. You got it?
078:23:23|P|PAO|Standing by for acquisition.
078:23:27|O|CMP|Yes.
078:23:33|O|CDR|I don't know what f-stop I ought to be at - Well - See what it's doing, Mike?
078:23:36|P|PAO|We've had AOS by Goldstone.
078:23:41|O|CMP|...
078:23:44|O|CMP|The flicker I don't know about, the white dot is - -
078:23:47|O|CDR|Yes, the flicker is what I'm - 
078:23:48|O|CMP|Nothing I can - -
078:23:50|O|LMP|Okay, we got it solid.
078:23:50|P|PAO|Television is now on. That is Bruce McCandless, our Capcom -
078:23:52|O|CDR|- - nothing you can do about the flicker.
078:23:54|O|CMP|Got it solid on AUTO.
078:23:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
078:24:06|O|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signal okay?
078:24:09|T|LMP|... Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signal okay?
078:24:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We are reading you loud and clear on voice and we have a good clear TV picture, a little bright crater in the - -
078:24:23|T|LMP|- - No, no, no - -
078:24:24|T|CC|- - the bottom of the picture. I guess that's the spot on the tube.
078:24:30|T|LMP|I'm sorry about that one.
078:24:32|T|CC|And if you give us P00 and ACCEPT, we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you.
078:24:45|T|CMP|Okay.
078:25:30|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a - oh, quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a fresh looking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.
078:26:23|T|CC|Roger. Do you have a location on that one?
078:26:33|T|LMP|No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.
078:26:37|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
078:26:41|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin making a report, a geological report on the back-side pass.
078:26:47|T|CC|We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.
078:27:09|T|LMP|That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.
078:27:45|T|CC|Roger.
078:27:51|T|CMP|And, we're about 95 or 100 degrees east and coming up on Smyth's Sea.
078:28:01|T|CC|Say again, 11?
078:28:07|T|CMP|I'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on Smyth's Sea.
078:28:11|T|CC|Roger. And for your information, we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now.
078:28:20|T|CMP|Okay.
078:28:22|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Did you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.
078:28:56|T|CMP|I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.
078:29:22|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger.
078:29:27|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins making that report.
078:29:30|T|LMP|Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at as we approach the powered descent. Over.
078:29:47|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Roger. And we're through with the uplink; the computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.
078:30:00|T|LMP|Roger. Copy.
078:30:08|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving toward the LM, pointed straight down toward the radius vector, and that's been despite a number of down minimum pitch impulses.
078:30:29|T|CC|Roger.
078:30:49|T|CMP|We're over Smyth's Sea right now.
078:30:51|T|CC|Roger.
078:30:56|T|CMP|We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.
078:31:03|T|CC|We show you about south of the - southwest of the crater Jansky right now.
078:31:27|T|CMP|Smyth Sea doesn't look much like a sea. It - The area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the maria at all.
078:31:41|T|CC|Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.
078:31:51|P|PAO|That exchange between Capcom, Bruce McCandless and Mike Collins aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft.
078:32:06|T|CMP|We think you're close, but no cigar.
078:32:52|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We acquired TV at 78 hours, 24 minutes, 11 seconds. Currently our orbital parameters show 104. Altitude an apolune of 170.2, a perilune of 61.3 - nautical miles, those are.
078:33:20|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?
078:33:28|T|CDR|Roger. We're approaching the approach path to ignition. This is equivalent to 13 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 80 degrees east, I guess - 83 degrees east. Would that correspond to location you're holding at ... present time?
078:33:58|T|CC|Roger. We're showing your present position as about 77 - 76 degrees east looking back towards the east.
078:34:16|T|CMP|Hey, you should be looking back at Smyth Sea now.
078:34:19|T|CC|Roger.
078:34:22|P|PAO|We've now heard from all three Apollo 11 crew members during this television pass. The individual talking earlier was Neil Armstrong.
078:34:23|T|CDR|Okay.
078:34:25|T|LMP|Houston, what you're seeing in the middle of the screen now is the crater Schubert and Gilbert U is in the center right now; and this comes up at about - a little over 12 minutes before powered decent. Instead of me looking - Instead of looking back at it, we'd be looking straight down at it in descent.
078:34:50|T|CC|Roger.
078:34:55|T|CC|And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.
078:35:17|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.
078:35:46|T|CC|Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.
078:35:58|T|CDR|Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those, plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.
078:36:35|T|CC|Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.
078:36:52|T|CDR|Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.
078:37:11|T|CMP|Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.
078:37:19|T|CC|Roger.
078:37:20|T|CDR|Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.
078:37:31|T|CMP|We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.
078:37:41|T|CC|Okay. We'll be watching for Camp.
078:37:48|T|CMP|And notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing.
078:37:55|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We confirm that you've changed the direction of your pitch rate.
078:38:28|T|CMP|Generally speaking - -
078:38:30|T|CDR|The crater - -
078:38:30|T|CMP|- - The tendency seems to be to pull the LM down toward the center of the Moon, as in a gravity gradient experiment.
078:38:39|T|CC|Roger, 11. We copy - -
078:38:40|T|CMP|It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may - -
078:38:45|T|CC|Roger. We copy ...
078:38:45|T|CDR|...
078:38:48|T|CMP|It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may just be the peculiarity of the DSKY display.
078:38:52|T|CC|Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.
078:39:08|T|CMP|Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.
078:39:13|T|CC|Roger.
078:39:25|T|CDR|Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand, and the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.
078:39:47|T|CC|Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.
078:40:01|T|CC|And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.
078:40:10|T|CDR|Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.
078:40:22|T|CMP|Yea. There's a great - bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - or correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.
078:41:03|P|PAO|We have been some 17 minutes now into this television pass and standing by continuing to monitor.
078:41:33|T|CC|Okay; we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.
078:41:47|T|LMP|Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before powered descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - to the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at this.
078:42:47|T|CC|Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.
078:43:01|T|LMP|Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.
078:43:04|T|CC|Roger.
078:43:08|T|CMP|And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen minimum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.
078:43:20|T|LMP|We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -
078:43:28|T|CC|Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.
078:43:53|T|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.
078:44:07|T|CMP|The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.
078:44:12|T|CDR|Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.
078:44:39|T|CC|Roger. That's very interesting - -
078:44:40|T|CMP|... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.
078:44:45|T|CC|(Laughter) Amen to that.
078:44:51|T|CC|Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.
078:44:59|T|LMP|Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before powered descent.
078:45:37|T|LMP|All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.
078:45:59|T|CMP|Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.
078:46:08|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78:53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI-2 and TEI 5 PADs ready for you after the TV, whenever you want to terminate. Over.
078:46:31|T|CDR|Roger.
078:46:32|T|CC|And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now.
078:46:57|T|CC|Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.
078:47:35|T|CC|And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.
078:48:00|T|CMP|I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.
078:48:14|T|CC|Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.
078:48:30|T|CMP|Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew said, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in higher Sun angles.
078:48:48|T|CC|Roger.
078:48:54|P|PAO|We're now some 25 minutes into our television pass.
078:49:06|T|CDR|Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.
078:49:31|T|CC|Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and of Secchi Theta.
078:49:44|T|CDR|And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.
078:50:03|P|PAO|Watching this pass with a great deal of interest here in mission Control Center is Pete Conrad, the commander for the Apollo 12 mission.
078:50:08|T|CDR|The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in powered descent.
078:50:29|T|CC|Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.
078:50:38|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
078:50:43|T|CMP|I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.
078:50:50|T|CC|I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.
078:50:56|T|CMP|I wouldn't be surprised.
078:51:11|T|CDR|We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.
078:51:35|T|CC|Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.
078:51:46|T|CDR|The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.
078:52:08|T|CC|Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.
078:52:24|T|LMP|How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?
078:52:33|T|CC|Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.
078:52:57|T|CDR|There's a good picture of Boot Hill.
078:53:01|T|CC|Roger. We're - -
078:53:02|T|CDR|Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.
078:53:08|T|CC|Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.
078:53:10|T|CDR|The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.
078:53:56|T|CC|Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.
078:54:13|T|CDR|Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.
078:54:20|T|CMP|That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.
078:54:41|T|CDR|And we're approaching the terminator now. See the - -
078:54:48|T|CC|Roger.
078:54:49|T|CDR| - contrast increased, and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.
078:54:58|T|CC|11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.
078:55:19|T|CMP|Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.
078:55:32|T|CC|Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.
078:55:45|T|CC|And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.
078:55:58|T|CC|Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?
078:56:03|T|CMP|Affirmative, we are.
078:56:06|T|LMP|Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.
078:56:11|T|CC|Roger.
078:56:13|T|CMP|We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract.
078:56:24|T|LMP|It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they approach the terminator.
078:56:42|T|CC|Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.
078:56:52|T|CMP|And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.
078:57:02|T|CC|Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.
078:57:11|T|CMP|I believe!
078:57:45|T|LMP|And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.
078:57:50|T|CC|Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.
078:57:57|P|PAO|There you have it. Our first glimpse of the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission. The eleven crew took us on a guided tour of the front side, plus talked their way through the power descent that lies ahead in tomorrows activities. At 78 hours 58 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor.
078:58:00|T|CMP|Well, it depends on your point of view. 
078:58:04|T|CC|Roger. Out.
078:58:20|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have an LOI-2 PAD and a TEI 5 PAD. Over.
078:58:30|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
078:58:46|T|CMP|I'm passing 182 inertial. I'm going inertial now.
078:58:54|T|LMP|Ready to copy LOI-2 PAD.
078:58:58|T|CC|Roger on the inertial. And here we go on the LOI-2 PAD. LOI-2, SPS/G&N: 38320, plus 166, minus 081; TIG 080:11:36.03. NOUN 81: minus 01408, minus all balls, minus 00743. Roll all balls, 196 359 00657, plus 00537. DELTA-VT 01592 017 01531. Sextant star 23 1160 138. The rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align, Vega and Deneb 243 183 012. Ullage, two jets 19 seconds. Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the Flight Plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79:30:10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79:52:10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degrees with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back. Over.
079:01:55|T|LMP|Roger, LOI-2: SPS/G&N: 38320, plus 166, minus 081 080:11:36.03, minus 01408, minus all balls, minus 00743, all zeros, 196 359 00657, plus 00537, 01592 017 01531 23 1160 138. Vega, Deneb 243 183 012, two jet 19 seconds, DAP, R1 20101. Sextant star between 79:30:10 and 79:52:10. Attitude is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degrees. HA after the burn - Was that NOUN 42 for HA and 64.6 and HP 54.6? Over.
079:03:19|T|CC|Roger. On the NOUN 42 value, the last stuff you gave, HA is 65.6, HP is 54.6. Otherwise, I readback correct. I'm standing by with your TEI 5 PAD. Over.
079:03:37|T|LMP|Roger. HA 65.6 for NOUN 42. And ready to copy.
079:03:43|T|CC|11, this is Houston. TEI 5 SPS/G&N: 37201, minus 060, plus 047; TIG 086:09:36.66. NOUN 81: plus 33521, plus 03441, minus 01458; roll NA, pitch 032. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jet, 16 seconds undocked. Over.
079:04:44|T|LMP|Roger. TEI 5 SPS/G&N: 37201, minus 060, plus 047 086:09:36.66, plus 33521, plus 03441, minus 0145 - 458, NA, 032. The rest is NA. Two jet, 16 seconds, undocked. Over.
079:05:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback is correct. Out.
079:05:42|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston.
079:05:44|T|CMP|Houston, you want us back on downvoice backup? Over.
079:05:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. That's affirmative on the downvoice backup. We'd like you to confirm your UPTELEMETRY switch in the NORMAL position. Over.
079:06:04|T|CMP|Roger. It's in BLOCK. Did you get us the - You got us a new CSM state vector and an LOI-2 target load in between all that television, didn't you?
079:06:13|T|CC|That's affirmative.
079:06:17|T|CMP|Thank you.
079:06:18|T|CC|And what I'm asking for is the switchover to - -
079:06:19|T|CMP|The UPTELEMETRY switch is in NORMAL. Over.
079:06:22|T|CC|Roger. Out.
079:08:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 9 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We currently read an apolune of 170.2 nautical miles a perilune of 61.2 nautical miles. Those listing of figures that you heard passed up to the crew were maneuver pad updates. The first group for LOI-2. We're now looking at the time of burn of 80 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, which should revise our orbital parameters to 65.7 nautical miles by 53.7 nautical miles. A Delta-V of 159.2 feet per second, and a burn duration of 17 seconds, some 17 seconds. So at 79 hours 9 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 79 hours 18 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. A quiet period at this time, as the Apollo 11 spacecraft continues its pass around the front side of the Moon. Our current altitude, very close to apolune, now reading 166.7 nautical miles. Our orbital parameters, 170.2 by 61.2 nautical miles. Current spacecraft weight in orbit, 71,622 pounds. We'll continue to keep the line up and continue to monitor the Apollo 11 crew. No doubt, at this time, preoccupied very probably with the alignment of their G&N platform. At 79 hours and 19 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:21:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
079:21:57|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
079:21:59|T|CC|Roger. During the LOI 1 burn, your engine burned a little bit more propellant than we predicted, and consequently, we'd like to update - or send you a new TEI 4 PAD. Over.
079:22:19|T|CMP|Okay.
079:22:23|T|CMP|Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too. It's all on the onboard tape, the time entry, and the chamber pressure; but to make a long story short, it worked its way up to 100.
079:22:34|T|CC|Roger.
079:22:39|T|CC|And down here, we showed a chamber pressure of on the order of 103 to 104 psi during your burn on playback.
079:22:50|T|CMP|Okay.
079:22:52|T|CDR|Go ahead with the TEI 4.
079:22:54|T|CC|Roger. TEI 4 revised: SPS/G&N: 38320, minus 055, plus 060 084:30:27.49, plus 31380, plus 03475, minus 01032; roll NA, pitch 034. Rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jets 16 seconds, undocked. No LOI-2. Over.
079:23:53|T|CDR|Just in TEI 4 SPS/G&N: 38320, minus 055, plus 060 084:30:27.49, plus 31380, plus 03475, minus 01032, NA, 034. All the rest of the PAD's NA. Two jets, 16 seconds, undocked. No LOI-2.
079:24:29|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
079:24:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 79 hours, 25 minutes. That maneuver pad that was transmitted to the crew - that was TEI, for Transearth Injection burn for the fourth revolution, is a contingency pad only to assure that it is properly onboard the spacecraft, if any unlikely event it should become necessary to return. At the present time we read an altitude of 157.7 nautical miles descending from apolune at this time. And our orbital parameters read 170.2 nautical miles, 61.2 nautical miles. We're some 23 minutes away at the present time from loss of signal. At 79 hours, 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:32:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston.
079:32:25|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
079:32:26|T|CC|Roger. We've been looking at your systems data on playback, and everything is looking good. In particular, the SPS looks good. I would like to remind you, though, of a request to perform this burn on the bank A ball valves only, and you are GO for LOI-2. Also, we have currently in the Flight Plan, you scheduled tomorrow to start entering the LM at about 96 hours GET, and we'd like to know if you have any plans to initiate this ingress into the LM earlier. If so, we can call the people in ahead of time. Over.
079:33:15|T|LMP|Well, we didn't have any plans to. No. We just wanted to be ready at that time.
079:33:20|T|CC|Roger. We just wanted to make sure that we were ready when you were ready. Over.
079:33:28|T|LMP|Okay. And to get the sextant star in LOI-2, that's roll zero. Is that affirmative?
079:33:38|T|CC|That's affirmative. Roll zero.
079:33:43|T|LMP|Okay.
079:34:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're some 14 minutes away now from loss of signal with the Command and Service Module of Apollo 11. At 79 hours, 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston, standing by.
079:37:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 79 hours, 38 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 now 130.4 nautical miles in altitude. Current velocity reading of 5,131 feet per second. Orbital parameters: apolune 170.2 nautical miles with a perilune reading 61.3 nautical miles. Apollo 11, at this time, has completed it's platform alignment and is maneuvering the spacecraft to its burn attitude. We are some 33 minutes away, now, from time of ignition for the Lunar Orbit Insertion number 2 burn, and we're 9 minutes 40 seconds away from loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. So at 79 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:43:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Five minutes until LOS. And with respect to your request for the nitrogen bottle pressures pre-burn, just before the burn, we were showing 2270 pounds per square inch on bottle Alfa and 2350 on bottle Bravo. Over.
079:43:59|T|LMP|Apollo 11. Roger. Thank you.
079:44:00|T|CC|Roger. Out.
079:46:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Two minutes to LOS. Your AOS on the other side is 80:33:21, and the friendly White Team will see you when you come out from behind the Moon.
079:46:41|T|CMP|Apollo 11. Roger.
079:46:43|T|CMP|Thank you, Bruce. ... "Greens".
079:46:43|T|CC|Make that your friend - your friendly White Team Capcom will see you when you come out from behind the Moon. I think it's basically the Maroon Team here, and we "Greenies" are leaving.
079:46:58|T|CMP|Okay. I don't blame you, Hank.
079:47:06|T|CC|Roger. I'd rather be up there.
079:48:00|P|PAO|Mark, 30 minutes - 30 seconds now from predicted time of loss of signal. Standing by. 10 seconds.
079:48:01|O|CMP|Another 5 minutes, Neil babe.
079:48:05|O|CDR|Okay.
079:48:20|O|CMP|This pitch angle is quite a bit off nominal; 196 instead of 212.
079:48:24|O|LMP|Umm.
079:48:26|O|CMP|16 degrees.
079:48:28|O|LMP|Yes, Shaffer screwed up - got to get his eccentric orbit.
079:48:29|P|PAO|Apollo 11 should now be passing out of range.
079:49:20|O|CMP|We is there.
079:49:26|O|CDR|Okay, I think I got Denebola in sight; let me look at the - Sure enough, I do. And it's good enough in the telescope; let me check it through the sextant. It's even in the sextant.
079:49:41|O|CMP|Beautiful! Fantastic!
079:49:43|O|LMP|Let's burn.
079:49:44|O|CMP|That's MANUAL and ZERO.
079:49:46|O|CDR|ZERO and MANUAL.
079:49:51|O|CMP|We done paid our debt to society; we done made a star check. 79:50 -
079:49:58|O|CDR|It used to be that you couldn't get control on LOI-2; that any burn, any attitude you made was safer than the regular attitude, but that isn't true any more.
079:50:07|O|LMP|Yes.
079:50:09|O|LMP|Okay, we got the OPTICS, ZERO?
079:50:13|O|CMP|Yes, I'm sure it is.
079:50:16|O|LMP|And we're not going to do any VERB 41, NOUN 91, any of that stuff - -
079:50:20|O|CMP|No ...
079:50:21|O|LMP|- - so you can - enter on this one.
079:50:26|O|CMP|Okay. OPTICS, ZERO, ZERO, huh?
079:50:29|O|LMP|No!
079:50:30|O|CDR|Supposed to be 0.7.
079:50:32|O|LMP|Oh.
079:50:33|O|CMP|Okay?
079:50:35|O|LMP|VERB 37, ENTER; 40, ENTER.
079:50:46|O|LMP|How does that look?
079:50:48|O|CMP|Looks beautiful. You enter on it, huh?
079:50:51|O|LMP|No. Leave it there.
079:50:52|O|CMP|Alright.
079:50:56|O|LMP|Align spacecraft roll, GDC ALIGN.
079:50:59|O|CMP|Um -
079:51:06|O|CMP|Yes, here we go - ...
079:51:08|O|CDR|doesn't look bad.
079:51:09|O|CMP|No, I just got through aligning it a little while ago.
079:51:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We are some 20 minutes away, at this time, of ignition for Lunar Orbit Insertion burn number 2. This - the fine tune second burn in the series of two as we have inserted into lunar orbit. For LOI2, the Apollo 11 will be heads down. The burn will be initiated near perilune as the spacecraft passes over the far side of the Moon. Retrograde, like LOI1, but unlike Apollo's 8 and 10. The burn will not be targeted to place a spacecraft into a precise circular orbit. Taking what was learned on Apollo 10, this LOI2 burn is designed to take into account predicted perturbations and gradually circularize itself. The numbers that we're looking at for LOI2, that would be time of ignition, 80 hours 11 minutes 36 Seconds, which should change our orbital parameters, giving us an apolune of 65.7 nautical miles and a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. The Delta-V intended for this burn, 159.2 feet per second. Burn duration anticipated 17 seconds. That's a burn of short duration, but certainly important in that it establishes the proper orbital parameters for the events that lie ahead. As you heard in earlier conversation, between our capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless and crew members aboard the spacecraft. We're GO for LOI-2. During this burn, we'll utilize only the bank A ball valve. The bank referred to here, which there are two mechanisms that drive the ball valves open and shut, causing fuel and oxidizer to mix for ignition. At the present time in Mission Control Center, the last reference you've heard from our capsule communicator reflects that they, on their own peculiar shift schedule, are having a change-of-shift. Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene and we can assume will take over the responsibilities of the conversational flow with the Apollo 11 spacecraft, once we reacquire. At 79 hours 55 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:51:42|O|CMP|Okay, GDC's aligned.

079:59:07|O|LMP|There's some in a lot of failures.
079:59:10|O|CMP|The only thing is all the engineering that went into those damn things, too. There's a lot of time and money down the pipe.
079:59:15|O|LMP|I mean, this big monstrosity out here, it fails -
079:59:18|O|LMP|Hey, we're coming up - You can see the horizon -
079:59:38|O|LMP|See if that looks pretty good - through the sextant and see if that doesn't come up.
079:59:47|O|CMP|Zap.
079:59:55|O|LMP|Sure has been ... back here.
080:00:05|O|CMP|Poor old LM is contaminated; it's got urine particles all over it; and, the way the light's shining here, they look yellow. You know, those little - I guess it probably is a little – solid now, the - everything else has boiled off and it's left a little solid.
080:00:23|O|CDR|..., huh?
080:00:26|O|CMP|... solid urine particles are ... I guess.
080:00:33|O|LMP|Wait until the back contam - forward contamination people hear about that.
080:00:37|O|CDR|Yes.
080:00:40|O|LMP|No more urine dumps on the way to the moon. Put it all in a nice little bag and –

080:16:36|O|CDR|BAT A, yes - if you please. Charging BAT A, then on to - -
080:16:42|O|LMP|Then roll 180, and then we'll talk about this pitchdown, alright?
080:16:47|O|CDR|Then you might as well go to your - 293 INERTIAL, I guess.
080:16:59|O|CMP|Man, that's a gas waster. Soon as I get around here, I'll start it. We'll pass through ORB rate at some point. Takes forever and a day to get around here.
080:17:23|O|LMP|It's going to be a long time before that battery gets back up to 39-1/2 volts.
080:17:29|O|LMP|We done plumb tuckered that one out.
080:17:33|O|CDR|LOI 1 could've got to it, I imagine.
080:17:35|O|CMP|Yes.
080:17:57|O|LMP|Are you going to maintain ORB rate?
080:18:01|O|CMP|Yes, I guess so. It's going to be sort of a pass through ORB rate kind of thing because, see if I whip - do it in a hurry, why I got to pitch down 80 degrees, stop the pitch, or stop almost all of it, except for the ORB rate amount. That's going to waste a hell of a lot of gas.
080:18:17|O|LMP|Do we have to do anything - to the O2 to pressurize the LM?
080:18:24|O|CMP|No, we haven't - small enough - DELTA-P -
080:18:30|O|LMP|That's 0.9.
080:18:31|O|CDR|0.9?
080:18:32|O|LMP|Yes.
080:18:33|O|CMP|Yes, we have to build up pressure a little bit.
080:18:38|O|CMP|Build up that cabin pressure just a little bit, and I'll start the DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN.
080:18:51|O|CDR|It says observe the lunar surface.
080:18:56|O|CDR|That's what it says you all are supposed to be doing.
080:19:06|O|CMP|It's brown; it's brown.
080:19:10|O|LMP|Brown all around. There's no doubt which way that - little crater hit.
080:19:34|O|LMP|Here's that same one going by again, Neil, remember? That bright job?
080:19:42|O|CDR|Yes.
080:19:54|O|LMP|Man, there's white stuff all over - and it's black right around the rim.
080:20:05|O|CMP|Hey, well, I'm - while this thing's rolling over, I'm going to take a pee; I'm going to go pee.
080:20:05|O|CDR|180, if you don't mind.
080:20:07|O|LMP|That's a spectacular crater.
080:20:15|O|CDR|Did you shoot some pictures while you were over there?
080:20:17|O|LMP|No, it's just going by - we'd better get it later; there will be better times. If the damn antenna isn't in the way -
080:20:45|O|LMP|Boy, there must be nothing more desolate than to be inside some of these small craters, these conical ones.
080:20:53|O|CDR|People that live in there probably would never get out.
080:20:57|O|LMP|Yes, I think you're right. Boy, you can really see the slumping, though. Most of the - You can see where it's all gathered down in the bottom in the corner; you know, on the edge - where a lot of the white stuff has dribbled down – and evidently it gets covered over after a while with a - a darker layer. There's always a certain amount of the white stuff right in the edges. Pretty characteristic of all of these – white conical ones.
080:21:54|O|LMP|Yes, you know, you can change the color of what you're looking at by moving your head to a different spot in the window - and looking in a different direction.
080:22:28|O|LMP|And that must be big ... right down there.
080:22:48|O|CMP|I haven't heard any woo-woo's.
080:22:52|O|LMP|Is there something we should be woo-wooing about?
080:22:59|O|CMP|Wait until we get the VHF on, then we'll hear the woo-wooing.
080:23:02|O|CDR|Okay.
080:23:22|O|LMP|Man, I sure hate to say it based on looking through this monocular, but there's a white spot that's just like a crater - looks like an awful lot under these small fresh ones in the bottom of this rather old crater, but right in the center of it, it looks like instead of there being a crater, looks like it's a rock. ... My eyes deceiving me.
080:23:54|O|CMP|How's our roll doing, Neil?
080:23:56|O|CDR|Oh, you got about 30 degrees to go.
080:23:58|O|CMP|Oh, boy!
080:24:00|O|CDR|Okay.
080:24:00|O|LMP|How far you going to roll?
080:24:03|O|CMP|Over and over.
080:24:33|O|CDR|Got that DIRECT O2 ..., didn't you?
080:24:36|O|CMP|Yes, just a tiny bit.
080:24:39|O|CDR|Okay.
080:24:45|O|LMP|It'd be kind of interesting to see some of this dump go on straight from polar orbit. Wonder how long it's going to take before it impacts?
080:24:56|O|LMP|It obviously - is not really in polar orbit if it's going off - going off that way. Yes, it's inclined to the small angle.
080:25:06|O|CMP|Sure looks like it.
080:25:07|O|LMP|It's going straight out there through. That's real funny.
080:25:16|O|LMP|Son of a gun, that one's got a little – little curve on it.
080:25:26|O|LMP|Would you believe that, Neil? One went out and curved around like that. Can you explain that?
080:25:35|O|CDR|I guess it just glanced off another particle or something.
080:25:38|O|LMP|Oh, no, no, no, no; if it's curved.
080:25:43|O|CMP|It had a little bubble in it that came to the surface and went kapoom and - -
080:25:47|O|LMP|No - -
080:25:48|O|CMP|There's atmospheric drag up here.
080:25:49|O|CMP|- - departed it with a little DELTA-V.
080:25:53|O|LMP|I think what's really happening is - we're rolling and - it's changing the angle that I'm looking out the window.
080:25:59|O|CMP|Let's see, I want to pitch down 80 degrees to - - ... 293, down 293, I believe that, I wonder what rate would be reasonable –
080:26:13|O|CDR|Okay, it's about 7 minutes until AOS.
080:26:20|O|CMP|Down 80 degrees in 7 minutes, that's - let's see, about 10 degrees per minute, 10 degrees per minute is -
080:26:34|O|CDR|... floating up here -
080:26:36|O|CMP|61 ...
080:26:41|O|LMP|Well, Mike probably let him out.
080:26:48|O|CMP|Okay, that ought to almost get it there and, damn, I don't want to see any more than that.
080:27:00|O|LMP|You can open the battery ... pad.
080:27:14|O|LMP|That ought to be enough.
080:27:34|O|CMP|... what's going on here?
080:28:05|O|CMP|Alright, where are we? We're pitching down. Gee, it's too bad we can't stop right here and observe the Earth come up. You know, we ought to get that picture one time.
080:28:23|O|CDR|We probably can - could. You could stop it right here if you wanted to spend the gas.
080:28:28|O|CMP|Yes. That's the only trouble, the doggone gas. What do you think?
080:28:45|O|CMP|A picture looking out over the LM as well.
080:28:48|O|CDR|Yes.
080:28:49|O|CDR|Shouldn't be a bad picture. Why don't we stop it?
080:28:51|O|CMP|Okay.
080:29:00|O|CDR|We ought to be able to get high-gain from this attitude, shouldn't we?
080:29:13|O|CDR|Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike?
080:29:15|O|CMP|Yes, we ought to get the 250 - we ought to do it at 250.
080:29:17|O|CDR|You've got 4 minutes; that's plenty, Now, we're going to want to - -
080:29:25|O|CMP|Are we at a good enough attitude? I hope so. We are out this window, babe, but we're not out that one. If the Earth is right there, that's where it's coming up, huh? Better be.
080:29:37|O|CDR|You want color?
080:29:28|O|CMP|Ah - -
080:29:40|O|CDR|We better have color.
080:29:41|O|CMP|Yes, we want color.
080:29:52|O|LMP|I got a clean window over here so don't sweat that one too much.
080:29:57|O|CMP|250 - hand me your camera, Neil, and I'll change it.
080:30:03|O|CDR|Who's got the Hasselblad?
080:30:10|O|LMP|Probably over there on the shelf.
080:30:12|O|CMP|We got it. First quad is in - back is - -
080:30:17|O|LMP|That wall of that crater looks pasty through the sextant. Great big chunks of white stuff that just slumped down.
080:30:32|O|CDR|Did you get - ...? If you get too far over here, we may have to watch our pitch angle. We're good right now.
080:30:42|O|LMP|If we stabilize.
080:30:46|O|CDR|ORB rate -
080:30:48|O|CMP|No, we're not ORB rate.
080:30:51|O|CDR|The Earth's going to be coming ORB rate at us.
080:30:54|O|CMP|...
080:31:01|O|CDR|Okay. Let's see, I've got to pitch up a tad then ...
080:31:09|O|LMP|Okay, I've still got f:8 and ...
080:31:12|O|CDR|250th at f:8, I think we can do it, and infinity.
080:31:19|O|CMP|Wait a minute; which way are we headed?
080:31:22|O|CDR|Oh, son of a gun! (Laughter) We're going backwards. ... Oh, well.
080:31:22|P|PAO|Mark 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. During this upcoming pass, we will have our second excursion on the part of the Apollo 11 crew into - into the Lunar Module. The LM is to be pressurized by a valve in a tunnel hatch. And, as a point of interest, will remain pressurized following of this period of activation and after the members of the Apollo 11 crew return to the Command Module. For this period of activation, it's definitely planned that Buzz will go into the LM and there is a distinct possibility that Commander Neil Armstrong could - could exercise his option and go into the LM. Our station to acquire, as we come around the far side of the Moon, will be Goldstone. Mark - 1 minute from predicted time of acquisition and we're standing by.
080:31:30|O|CMP|Oh dear.
080:31:34|O|CDR|Dummkopf!
080:31:35|O|CMP|That's it, I think, there, Neil - so pitch down.
080:31:38|O|LMP|Prior planning prevents poor performance.
080:31:41|O|CDR|Thank you. Is that right, Buzz?
080:31:43|O|CMP|All that - Where'd you ever hear that one, Buzz?
080:31:48|O|LMP|I can't think.
080:32:15|O|LMP|Oh, that's a bright one; I got to get that one ...
080:32:19|O|LMP|No lie!
080:32:28|O|CDR|150 - you don't want to take too many on this.
080:32:33|O|CMP|No. Might as well put the other one back on.
080:32:38|O|CDR|Well, you might save that for some Earth shots.
080:32:52|O|LMP|Wow!
080:32:52|P|PAO|Mark 30 seconds.
080:32:55|O|CDR|...
080:32:58|O|CMP|You got it, huh?
080:33:06|O|LMP|I think it focused the second one a little bit better. I think it's beautiful. Just fabulous. Not really sure what you're looking at - but there's some mighty big fresh blocks down in that crater.
080:33:12|P|PAO|Mark 10 seconds from predicted time of acquisition.
080:33:40|O|LMP|The walls actually look pockmarked. Sure enough, and they're not filled in. Pockmarked and it looks like somebody's painted white paint vertically down the edges and then it's been eaten away.
080:34:05|P|PAO|Goldstone has acquired Apollo 11.
080:34:18|O|LMP|... that one ... into the LM.
080:34:40|O|CMP|Here is the Earth. Hey, I got the view over here.
080:34:46|O|LMP|I guess I'd better get the high-gain on, hadn't I?
080:34:51|O|CDR|Did it just come up?
080:34:52|O|CMP|Yes.
080:34:55|O|LMP|We need that ... camera.
080:34:58|O|CMP|Do we still got high-gain?
080:34:59|O|CDR|Yes.
080:35:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, standing by at this time at 80 hours 35 minutes.
080:35:03|O|CMP|It's says minus 67 and zero.
080:35:08|O|LMP|Minus 67 and zero.
080:35:10|O|CMP|And zero.
080:35:12|O|LMP|Okay, MANUAL - and - AUTO - medium. There we go. Can't make up his mind between zero and - 360. Okay, we got them.
080:35:24|P|PAO|Both Goldstone and Hawaii have acquired a signal. We will -
080:35:30|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
080:35:32|O|CDR|Okay.
080:35:33|O|CC|Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
080:35:36|O|CDR|Do you want to talk to them?
080:35:39|O|CDR|... Roger, Houston. Burn status report follows: DELTA-TIG zero; burn time, 17; angle with the pad values, DELTA-VGX was plus 0.3; VGY, minus 0.0; VGZ minus 0.1; DELTA-VC, minus 5.2; fuel, 362; OX, 364; unbalance, plus 50, and a post-burn NOUN 94, 66.1 by - -
080:35:58|T|CDR|- VGY minus 0.0, VGZ minus 0.1, DELTA-VC minus 5.2, fuel 362, OX 364, unbalance plus 50, and our post-burn now 94's, 66.1 by 54.4. Go ahead.
080:36:24|T|CC|Roger. We copy, Neil. Would you say again the DELTA-VZ? We missed that. Over.
080:36:31|T|CDR|Roger. That was minus 0.1.
080:36:34|T|CC|Roger. Copy the burn report. Sounds good.
080:36:42|T|CDR|And all looked good up here.
080:37:06|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We missed your DELTA-TIG and also your DELTA burn time. Over.
080:37:15|T|CDR|DELTA-TIG was zero and the burn time was 17 seconds.
080:37:19|T|CC|Copy 17.
080:37:32|P|PAO|You heard that report from Commander Neil Armstrong indicating that LOI-2 was all - came off almost precisely as planned.
080:38:05|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll be satisfied if you pump up the cabin to 5.4. Over.
080:38:13|T|CDR|Okay. We're showing about 5.2 right now.
080:38:18|T|CC|Roger.
080:38:40|T|CDR|And, Charlie, the LM/CM DELTA-P is just over 1 pound right now.
080:38:44|T|CC|Copy. Out.
080:43:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
080:44:32|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
080:45:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston -
080:45:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If you read, please attempt to acquire on the high-gain. We're having trouble locking up on the TM and we have no voice. Over.
080:45:41|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. You copied that report. We're standing by for Apollo 11 spacecraft to acquire on the high-gain antenna. Meanwhile, onboard readings on orbital parameters were 66.1 nautical miles by 54.4 nautical miles, very close to the planned altitudes that were predicted prior to the LOI-2 burn. At 80 hours 46 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:47:23|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11 -
080:47:23|T|CDR|Apollo 11.
080:47:25|T|CC|Roger. We're reading you five by. Go ahead. Over.
080:47:32|T|CDR|Roger. We have you on high-gain now.
080:47:34|T|CC|Roger. We lost the TM and the voice for about 5 minutes here. We attempted a handover and fouled it up in some manner, but we got you back now. Thank you much.
080:47:47|T|CDR|Okay. We're pressurizing the LM at this time.
080:47:50|T|CC|Copy.
080:41:15|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston 80 hours 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Very preliminary ground readings indicate an apolune of 65.6, perilune 53.7.
080:51:12|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have a P22 AUTO optics update for you if you're ready to copy. Over.
080:51:22|T|CMP|Ready to copy.
080:51:23|T|CC|Roger, Mike. It's landmark Alpha 1: T1, 82:37:35; T2, 82:42:50. We're 7 miles north. Over.
080:51:59|T|CMP|Copy. P22. T1 time, 82:37:35; T2, 82:42:50. And the target is 7 miles north. Thank you.
080:52:11|T|CC|Roger.
080:52:24|P|PAO|That was passed up to Mike Collins, the Command Module Pilot, who will occupy himself during this pass on the - over the front side with landmark tracking activities. At 80 hours, 53 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, we continue to monitor.
080:55:32|T|CDR|I get the distinct impression, Charlie, that mare surface laps up over the edge of the mountains at the shorelines.
080:55:42|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
080:56:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 80 hours, 56 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current velocity reading 5,334 feet per second. Current weight of the spacecraft in orbit, 75,505 pounds.
080:56:40|T|CC|Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more look like it's sloping up at that point? Over.
080:57:06|T|CDR|It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.
080:57:23|T|CC|Roger.
080:57:29|P|PAO|That was Commander Neil Armstrong talking to our Capsule Communicator Charles Duke. Our current orbital readings show an apolune of 65.5, a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. At 80 hours, 58 minutes into the flight, we continue to monitor, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:58:41|T|CDR|Crossing Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
080:58:47|T|CC|Say again, Neil. Over.
080:58:51|T|CDR|We just crossed Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
080:58:56|T|CC|Roger.
081:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours into the flight of Apollo 11, a period of relative quiet. No doubt the Apollo 11 crew quite preoccupied in preparation for the activation of the LM. During this period of relative quiet, we'll pass along the heart rates from the LOI-1 burn, that's LOI-1, not LOI-2 (we have yet to receive those numbers). The heart rate for the Commander Neil Armstrong read 106, for Command Module Pilot Mike Collins, 66, and for the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin we have a reading of 70. At 81 hours, 1 minute into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:05:34|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. At 81 hours 5 minutes into the flight. Still a period of relative quiet. Our ground readings indicate that the Apollo 11 spacecraft has completed its Program 52, that's to align the inertial platform. Indications from the ground are that it - this activity went very well. And at 81 hours 6 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:14:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 15 minutes. It's been an extremely quiet pass. No doubt, the Apollo 11 crew, quite busy at this time. We expect, at the time entry is made into the Lunar Module, Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, will be out of acquisition, traversing over the far side of the Moon. At the present time, we read an altitude, current altitude, reading of 56.7 nautical miles. Our ground displays indicate an apolune of 65.4, a perilune of 53.8 and spacecraft velocity of 5,364 feet per second. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 16 minutes into the flight.
081:22:57|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're wondering if you've started into the LM yet. Over.
081:23:06|T|CDR|We have the CSM hatch out, the drogue and probe removed and stowed, and we're just about ready to open the LM hatch now.
081:23:15|T|CC|Roger. Thank you much, Neil. We'll be standing by.
081:23:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 81 hours 24 minutes now into the flight. The silence of conversation between Mission Control Center, Houston and the crew has broken there moments ago. Charlie Duke called up Apollo 11 and spoke with Neil Armstrong, who indicated that the hatch was out and the probe and drogue removed and they were about ready to open the Lunar Module hatch. Our current altitude shows 54.7 nautical miles, apolune, 65.4, perilune, 53.8. Interestingly enough, the part of the LM activation which we will follow most closely will be at time of reacquisition following our pass over the far side of the Moon. This will be on the front side. It will afford us an opportunity for a communications check with the Lunar Module and there will be a transfer to LM power. At 81 hours 25 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:25:53|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. We're in the LM. The docking index mark is the same.
081:26:01|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
081:26:11|P|PAO|You heard that report from Neil Armstrong. They are now in the Lunar Module.
081:26:53|T|LMP|Charlie, apparently there just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get that REPRESS to AUTO without making a big bang.
081:27:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
081:27:08|T|LMP|Roger. There just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get the REPRESS from closed to AUTO and avoid a big bang. Over.
081:27:16|T|CC|Oh, we copy, Buzz. Thank you much. Out.
081:27:22|T|CC|We concur with that, Buzz.
081:27:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have LOS 81:45, next AOS - Stand by.
081:27:47|T|CC|Next AOS 82:32. Over.
081:27:54|T|CDR|Okay. 82:32.
081:29:30|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I am going to start a maneuver to P22 attitude at this time.
081:29:35|T|CC|11. Roger. We copy. Over.
081:29:41|T|CMP|Okay. We're noticing some water inside the Command Module for the first time. There's a little puddle of it on the aft bulkhead sort of like 101 had.
081:29:49|T|CC|Roger.
081:29:54|T|CMP|I'd like to know how EECOMM wants to get rid of it. There are a number of different ways and what does he think is the best one?
081:29:59|T|CC|We'll be with you in a moment, Mike. Stand by.
081:30:04|T|CMP|No big rush. It will wait until the next REV or two.
081:30:07|T|CC|All right.
081:30:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 81 hours 30 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 Commander and Lunar Modules pilots appear to be a little bit ahead on their timelines in the LM activation period. Meanwhile, Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins proceeding further with his landmark tracking exercises. Mike also reported a little puddle of water inside the Command Module near the aft bulkhead his reference to like 101 referred to the Apollo 7 spacecraft, which was commanded by Walter Schirra. Our current altitude 54 nautical miles, current apolune 65.4, our current perilune 53.8. We now show a weight in orbit of 70,472 pounds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor at 81 hours 32 minutes into the flight.
081:40:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We are now some five minutes away from loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We currently show an altitude of 54.2 nautical miles, apolune 65.4, perilune 53.9 nautical miles. Flight Director, Milt Windler now talking with various members of his flight control team. We would expect a final bit of conversation prior to loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We'll keep our line up and continue to monitor conversations that could transpire prior to loss of signal. Standing by at 81 hours 41 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.
081:40:21|O|LMP|Well, they look like they were made to go - That's - that's it, isn't it? Weren't they made to put here so you stow them by putting them on here instead of the way we do it?
081:40:39|O|CDR|...
081:40:48|O|CMP|Then we only have to decide what - what's supposed to go here.
081:40:54|O|LMP|I ... two of them.
081:40:59|O|CMP|Both of those - those things are in here.
081:41:04|O|CDR|... worry about nothing goes in there ...
081:41:19|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've played back the LOI-2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
081:41:21|O|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've played back the LOI-2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
081:41:37|O|CDR|Sounds good, Houston.
081:41:39|T|CDR|Sounds good, Houston.
081:41:40|O|LMP|I need that film now.
081:41:42|O|CDR|Okay.
081:41:45|O|LMP|...
081:41:57|O|CDR|Okay, want to get film.
081:41:24|P|PAO|Mark 3 minutes now from predicted time of loss of signal.
081:42:06|O|CDR|It's a long trip to the film container.
081:42:31|O|CMP|You want something?
081:42:31|O|CDR|Oh, shoot. I'm going to have trouble getting in there.
081:43:23|P|PAO|Mark 2 minutes now from time of LOS.
081:43:38|O|CMP|How's it going, Neil? You getting any?
081:43:41|O|CDR|No.
081:43:58|O|CDR|Well -
081:44:08|O|CDR|Buzz, the 70-millimeter container's only got one black and white and one color in it - Isn't it supposed to - -
081:44:15|O|CMP|That's - that's not - that's mine.
081:44:18|O|LMP|You've got the wrong one.
081:44:19|O|CMP|No, that's not the right one.
081:44:22|O|CDR|The one - -
081:44:24|O|CMP|The one you want, Neil, is way over here in – R-13.
081:44:24|P|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of LOS.
081:44:31|O|LMP|No, it's not in there; it was on my girth shelf.
081:44:34|O|CMP|Okay.
081:44:34|O|CDR|Oh, okay, there it is. Did you get that one put back?
081:44:39|O|CMP|No, but I will.
081:44:40|O|CDR|Okay, appreciate it. I had it in my mind that - our - -
081:44:46|O|CMP|You want to do something to the polarizing filter, Neil?
081:44:58|O|CDR|Uh - -
081:44:58|O|CMP|I'll stick it up there on the ceiling. There's a - -
081:45:01|O|CDR|- - not really.
081:45:02|O|CMP|- - we got room for it up there.
081:45:29|P|PAO|We've now had loss of signal with Apollo 11. At 81 hours, 45 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:45:28|O|CMP|You want the 16-millimeter while you're down here, Neil?
081:45:30|O|CDR|Yes.
081:45:31|O|CMP|The 16-millimeter bag as well?
081:45:33|O|CDR|Yes, I'll take that one, too.
081:45:36|O|LMP|Okay.
081:45:58|O|CMP|Well, that - damn stuff won't stick. Haven't got a piece of Velcro on the -
081:46:10|O|CDR|You're not ...
081:47:33|O|CMP|Man, can't you stop some of that racket up there?
081:47:37|O|CMP|Huh?
081:47:52|O|CMP|That's the S-band - you turned your volumes down.
081:48:06|O|SC|(Coughing)
081:48:16|O|CMP|Is that better on the S-band?
081:48:19|O|CDR|Yes.
081:48:19|O|LMP|Yes.
081:48:20|O|CMP|Okay.
081:48:50|O|LMP|(Sneeze)
081:48:50|O|LMP|There's one that's got mission rules in it – but I can't quite, at the moment, put my hands on it. ...
081:50:09|O|LMP|It's a NO-GO - GO/NO-GO - the one one I'm looking for. Hey, that's beautiful.
081:50:27|O|CDR|Like this?
081:50:30|O|LMP|Yes.
081:50:33|O|CDR|That's the one we made the changes in, right?
081:50:37|O|LMP|Right.
081:50:39|O|CDR|It may be up in the - in the Command Module, huh? Have you got another clip?
081:50:49|O|LMP|Yes. you need one?
081:50:50|O|CDR|I thought we might just stick my – activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.
081:50:56|O|LMP|Right here?
081:50:57|O|CDR|Yes. ...
081:51:01|O|LMP|We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the - -
081:51:18|O|CDR|I'll go check around up here.
081:51:20|O|LMP|Oh, wait a minute, here it is. I got it.
081:51:23|O|CDR|I don't think the - -
081:51:25|O|LMP|This other one got changed.
081:51:27|O|CDR|No, it didn't.
081:51:30|O|LMP|You want to do that?
081:51:32|O|CDR|Yes, I can do that.
081:51:48|O|LMP|And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?
081:52:17|O|LMP|Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well ... the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.
081:53:19|O|LMP|You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?
081:53:24|O|CDR|Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you - ...
081:53:39|O|LMP|...
081:53:41|O|CDR|Yes, dark slide in.
081:53:54|O|CDR|It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.
081:53:58|O|LMP|Alright. ... for telling me.
081:54:09|O|LMP|Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.
081:55:32|O|LMP|Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A ... - one of them is R and the other is S.
081:55:41|O|CDR|Yes.
081:55:42|O|LMP|I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.
081:55:45|O|CDR|Okay.
081:55:46|O|LMP|And the S in the surface camera.
081:55:48|O|CDR|Good idea.
081:55:49|O|LMP|Even though we're going to use them the other way.
081:56:32|O|CDR|Do you want to try it out in there?
081:56:35|O|LMP|I guess we could open the window here, just as well.
081:56:59|O|LMP|The window's all - frosted over.
081:57:03|O|CDR|Is it?
081:57:06|O|LMP|Well, I hate to stick my finger on it; I'm not sure which side it's on.
081:57:09|O|CDR|We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.
081:57:15|O|LMP|No, I think when the sun gets on them, it'll - ... them. Yes, the one on your side is ...
081:58:06|O|CDR|The black and white is magazine Q. 
082:02:04|O|LMP|I don't guess there's any need to tape that up now.
082:02:17|O|LMP|We're on the back side now, right?
082:02:19|O|CDR|Yes, just come into - we're just coming into sunlight.
082:02:22|O|LMP|And we don't get the - contrast ...
082:02:30|O|CDR|What's the mission time, Mike?
082:02:34|O|CMP|Just a second. About 82 hours even.
082:02:39|O|CDR|CMP
082:02:40|O|CMP|82:02.
082:02:41|O|LMP|Okay, when do you get your tracking?
082:02:43|O|CMP|In a little while.
082:02:46|O|LMP|About what time?
082:02:51|O|CMP|About another half hour.
082:02:54|O|LMP|Before 83 hours?
082:03:05|O|CDR|Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the sun was on it.
082:03:22|O|LMP|Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - ... over the horizon.
082:04:20|O|LMP|I don't think there's any place except in the – in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage -
082:04:31|O|CDR|In the card, right?
082:04:34|O|LMP|No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are; 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.
082:05:13|O|CDR|You got the Flight Plan handy, Mike?
082:05:15|O|CMP|Yes, I have; just a second.
082:05:18|O|CDR|I don't want it up here; I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.
082:05:24|O|CMP|It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the COMM.
082:06:03|O|LMP|12 feet per second - half an hour.
082:06:14|O|LMP|Did you say something about taking pictures right now?
082:06:17|O|CMP|No, no; stop the camera.
082:06:19|O|LMP|Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.
082:06:28|O|LMP|One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.
082:06:38|O|CMP|No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles.
082:06:49|O|LMP|Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.
082:06:57|O|CDR|Alright. You want one?
082:07:00|O|LMP|Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.
082:09:03|O|CDR|Hand me a towel when you get a chance.
082:09:13|O|LMP|... left window ...
082:09:47|O|CDR|This one's getting pretty well cleared off over here on the left.
082:10:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 4
082:10:02|O|LMP|You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.
082:11:02|O|LMP|All that'll do is warm it up.
082:11:40|O|LMP|When do we have AOS?
082:11:48|O|CMP|Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.
082:12:43|O|LMP|Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture – of the Earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?
082:14:06|O|LMP|Unique feature - photography (laughter). ... on the top of it.
082:14:34|O|LMP|What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th? ...
082:14:50|O|CDR|Yes. ...
082:15:08|O|LMP|What do you know, it works!
082:15:16|O|CDR|I could sure get the stop watch, huh?
082:15:19|O|LMP|Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.
082:15:29|O|CDR|...
082:15:30|O|LMP|...
082:15:31|O|CMP|I'm just fooling around; what do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.
082:15:49|O|LMP|Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?
082:15:58|O|CDR|Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?
082:16:03|O|LMP|Yes. Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes -
082:16:45|O|CDR|Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?
082:18:10|O|CDR|No wonder - ...
082:18:19|O|CMP|Uh, ...
082:18:23|O|CDR|... that's the reason - -
082:18:24|O|CMP|No, I don't think you know; I don't think you know; I don't see how you know.
082:18:29|O|LMP|Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?
082:18:32|O|CDR|What's that?
082:18:33|O|LMP|In the LM, this cover for the camera.
082:18:43|O|LMP|Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?
082:20:00|O|LMP|Now, a few pictures of that and one of earthrise and - and then we'll stow it.
082:21:43|O|LMP|Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.
082:22:09|O|CDR|Do you know where the shaving cream is?
082:22:14|O|CMP|Shaving cream?
082:22:15|O|CDR|Yes.
082:22:16|O|CMP|Yes, I sure do; it's - -
082:22:18|O|LMP|In the penlight.
082:22:19|O|CMP|- - in the penlight compartment, huh?
082:22:51|O|LMP|How about this thing; you see any need to – to keep that in the LM?
082:23:05|O|LMP|Neil, what did you do with the - ... camera back sight?
082:23:10|O|CDR|I haven't had it.
082:23:11|O|LMP|Okay. What do you think about that?
082:23:14|O|CDR|I can't think of any reason why we might use it.
082:23:17|O|LMP|Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?
082:24:03|O|CMP|He's shaving.
082:24:35|O|CMP|I'm through with the Flight Plan, Neil, if you want it.
082:24:39|O|CDR|...
082:24:53|O|CDR|... razor?
082:24:57|O|CMP|The razor should be in there with the shaving cream, isn't it?
082:24:59|O|CDR|No - -
082:25:00|O|CMP|It wasn't?
082:25:01|O|CDR|- - ... shaving cream.
082:25:03|O|CMP|The razor wasn't in there?
082:25:04|O|CDR|The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but - -
082:25:10|O|LMP|How much time to AOS, Mike?
082:25:14|O|CMP|82:30 - about 5 minutes.
082:28:41|O|LMP|Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.
082:28:49|O|LMP|Hey, Mike?
082:28:50|O|CMP|Yes.
082:28:55|O|LMP|You got VHF B available?
082:28:57|O|CMP|What? Say again?
082:29:03|O|LMP|I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.
082:29:09|O|CMP|Not right now, not for another half hour or so.
082:29:11|O|LMP|No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?
082:29:19|O|CMP|If I'm going to record your data, I am.
082:29:28|O|LMP|Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.
082:29:32|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're now within 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. As we make this pass - near side pass, on the fourth revolution, it will be the first time that we have transferred during this mission to Lunar Module Pilot - power, and a communications check will be performed on the Lunar Module. We should be hearing such things as long counts being given from the spacecraft. Additionally, a new display - the lunar landing site display is now up for the first time in Mission Control Center this flight. It's essentially a blowup for the landing sites 1 and 2. We expect it to stay up through the time of lunar landing. Meanwhile a Mission Control Center Flight Director, Milt Windler, beginning to discuss with members of his Flight Control team items that might be expected after we acquire. We're less than a minute away at this time - at this time from our forecast acquisition. We'll stand by.
082:30:28|O|LMP|... coming up now.
082:31:33|P|PAO|Standing by now for acquisition.
082:31:49|P|PAO|We have acquisition. We are receiving telemetry data at this time. Hawaii and Goldstone have both acquired.
082:31:54|O|CDR|Did you get them?
082:31:56|O|LMP|No, sure didn't.
082:32:01|O|CDR|Yes.
082:32:02|O|LMP|But I can't see ... - I see the Earth, but it's a lousy picture.
082:32:25|O|CMP|Could you wait just 1? I'm right in the middle of the event-timer setting.
082:32:35|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Out.
082:32:40|O|CMP|Okay, Houston. We'll be doing P22 in just a couple of minutes here.
082:32:43|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We'll be done with P22 in just a couple of minutes.
082:32:46|T|CC|Roger. We copy all that. You're looking good.
082:32:52|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins indicating he would be doing the allude - additional landmark tracking, and we shall hear further from him shortly.
082:32:48|O|CMP|You want to come in, Neil? Going in?
082:34:00|O|CMP|Want back up?
082:34:01|O|CDR|No.
082:34:01|O|LMP|Here's your shaving cream.
082:34:04|O|CMP|My only problem is I'm going to come over here and grab a switch and arm this hand controller.
082:34:07|O|CDR|Alright. I'll be out of your way.
082:34:09|O|CMP|Okeydoke. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see - -
082:34:27|O|CDR|Okay.
082:34:27|O|CMP|- - whether I'm spaced properly or not, you know what I mean?
082:34:29|O|CDR|Yes.
082:34:29|O|CMP|Coach me along on when to take mark number 2, mark number 3, 4, 5.
082:34:52|O|CMP|And could you give me a hack on the MDC mission timer? It's going up to 35 minutes. Ready -
082:35:00|O|CMP|MARK it.
082:35:03|O|CDR|35 minutes.
082:35:06|O|CMP|Okay, that's good. That program alarm is normal; it will reach that when the trunnion gets down below 50 degrees.
082:35:21|O|CDR|Okay.
082:35:24|O|CMP|All I'm doing is waiting for - the time; everything else is done.
082:35:47|O|CDR|You holding inertial, Mike?
082:35:48|O|CMP|Yes.
082:35:51|O|LMP|No wonder the Earth isn't moving.
082:36:06|O|CMP|Ho-hum, ho-hum. I only got set up for this thing about an hour early (laughter). Better late than never; better early than late.
082:37:06|O|CMP|... should be coming over the horizon here pretty soon.
082:37:10|O|LMP|What should be?
082:37:13|O|CDR|Old A-1.
082:37:15|O|CMP|Old A-1.
082:37:21|O|CDR|Now, we'll see if you can find something that looks like A-1.
082:37:25|O|LMP|I got the Earth down by the strut.
082:37:47|O|LMP|The problem with this window is, Neil, I think it's too cold in here.
082:37:52|O|CMP|Neil, I'm going to get up here and get pitch - MANUAL ATTITUDE PITCH to ACCEL COMMAND. Those hand controllers are armed, so beware.
082:38:03|O|CDR|Okay.
082:38:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 82 hours, 38 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Well, we have single contact with Apollo 11 thus far this pass, when Mike Collins identified he was still involved with program 22, the auto optics landmark tracking activity. We expect additional conversation as the pass transpires. Presently we're reading on our orbit displays an altitude of 65.1 nautical miles, apolune 65.3 nautical miles, perilune of 54 nautical miles. We currently show a velocity on the Apollo 11 spacecraft of 5318 feet per second - 5318 feet per second. At 82 hours, 39 minutes, and continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:41:26|O|CMP|If I'd known you were going to be here, I'd of incorporated you into the procedures.
082:41:31|O|CDR|Keep looking through the periscope, then.
082:41:33|O|CMP|What I need is - 0.3 to 0.5 on this thing, closer to 3. I'd get it, but you - -
082:41:41|O|CDR|I'll watch.
082:41:41|O|CMP|- - just as a doublecheck - -
082:41:43|O|CDR|I'll watch.
082:42:12|O|LMP|The preflight - ...
082:42:56|O|CDR|That ... is working.
082:42:57|O|CMP|Okay, fine.
082:43:32|O|CMP|Okay, MARK it –
082:43:32|O|CMP|Number 1. They're 30-second marks.
082:43:36|O|CDR|Check.
082:43:48|O|CDR|15.
082:43:51|O|CMP|How many?
082:43:52|O|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 - 30 -
082:44:02|O|CMP|MARK it -
082:44:03|O|CMP|Number 2.
082:44:04|O|CDR|Okay.
082:44:05|O|CMP|I have a feeling somehow I got to do these ...
082:44:17|O|CDR|15 -
082:44:18|O|CMP|Okay.
082:44:27|O|CDR|25 -
082:44:32|O|CMP|MARK it -
082:44:32|O|CMP|Number 3.
082:44:33|O|CDR|Okay.
082:44:46|O|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 -
082:45:01|O|CMP|MARK it -
082:45:01|O|CMP|Number 4.
082:45:02|O|CDR|Okay.
082:45:17|O|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 -
082:45:30|O|CMP|MARK it -
082:45:30|O|CMP|Number 5.
082:45:33|O|CDR|Okay.
082:45:34|O|CMP|... confirm -
082:45:44|O|CMP|...
082:45:51|O|CDR|Check.
082:45:53|O|CMP|Checklist says - You're going to go blind doing this - ... 06 71 - confirm 7000; 06 89 confirm ... 320 7000 ... -
082:46:10|O|CDR|Just leave it; keep pitching?
082:46:12|O|CMP|Yes. But I don't know why we're getting that thrust rate there, maybe the ... getting unhappy - -
082:46:18|O|CDR|... look at that roll and stuff ... that yaw ...
082:46:22|O|CMP|Yes. It's Just like the simulator, remember that?
082:46:25|O|CDR|Yes.
082:46:27|O|CMP|It's ...
082:46:28|O|CDR|We're yawing pretty good. 0.4, I'd say - -
082:46:34|O|CMP|We're going to have to check that out.
082:46:35|O|CDR|- - towards gimbal lock.
082:46:36|O|CMP|Toward gimbal lock?
082:46:38|O|CDR|It's only gone 10 degrees towards gimbal lock.
082:46:41|O|CMP|Well, that's a pretty good error. I don't know why in the hell it does that.
082:46:50|O|CMP|Would you like to control the ...? I'd say we're going to keep pitching for quite a while.
082:47:00|O|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:47:01|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:47:04|T|CC|Go ahead.
082:47:07|O|CMP|Roger. You copy that NOUN 29 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
082:47:08|T|CMP|Roger. You copy that NOUN 29 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
082:47:12|T|CC|We got it. Go ahead, Mike.
082:47:37|O|CMP|Look, what gimbal angle was that when - on the pitch - when that activity started, just out of curiosity?
082:47:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 82 hours 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. our air-to-ground sounding somewhat noisy, this being because we're utilizing the omni antenna for downlink. This, a requirement because of the attitude required for landmark tracking for program 22. At 82 hours 48 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:47:42|O|CDR|Oh, must have been around - 210.
082:47:51|O|CMP|Just like the simulator.
082:48:02|O|CMP|Okay, now, the Flight Plan says where we want to stop ..., that says so right here - pitch 229 is where we want to stop.
082:48:09|O|CDR|Okay, we've gone by that, however, quite a ways.
082:48:12|O|CMP|I'm sorry, let's stop, then.
082:48:14|O|LMP|Is that local vertical?
082:48:16|O|CMP|No.
082:48:23|O|LMP|Okay. And after those pictures, ... lunar surface.
082:48:28|O|CDR|You want to go back to 229 or what?
082:48:31|O|CMP|Let me see the Flight Plan just a second. Yes.
082:48:43|O|CMP|Might as well just - just let it stop itself, Neil.
082:48:49|O|CDR|I've got to - look at the - -
082:48:52|O|CMP|Yes, go ahead.
082:48:54|O|CDR|- - the ... ... like - gangbusters?
082:48:59|O|CMP|... 225 is ...
082:49:13|O|CMP|MARK -
082:49:14|O|CMP|02009.
082:49:24|O|CMP|MARK -
082:49:24|O|CMP|22590. Minus 00177.
082:50:01|O|CMP|Okay. So much for that.
082:50:27|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see a NOUN 89. You can do the VERB 34 now. Over. Beat me to it.
082:50:29|O|LMP|A beautiful view out here, Neil.
082:50:35|O|CMP|Yes. I've done it, Charlie.
082:50:36|T|CMP|Yes. I've done it, Charlie.
082:50:38|T|CC|Roger.
082:50:53|O|LMP|What's the GET?
082:50:57|O|CMP|It's 82:51.
082:51:36|O|CMP|There's Mount Marilyn.
082:51:38|O|CDR|Yes.
082:51:57|O|CMP|Okay, we didn't waste any gas by doing what we did, but what we wasted gas by was that goddamn DAP activity; I don't understand that. Just like the simulator.
082:52:11|O|CDR|Sure enough.
082:52:15|O|CMP|You got a good view there, Neil?
082:52:16|O|CDR|Yes, I sure do.
082:52:19|O|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:52:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:52:22|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
082:52:27|O|CMP|All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow roll and yaw got excited, and DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS and had just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.

082:52:57|T|CC|Roger. We saw that activity, Mike. We'll see if we can track it down and let you know. Over.
082:53:04|O|CMP|Okay.
082:53:04|T|CMP|Okay.
082:53:37|O|CMP|Well, one P22 out of the way. Ho, ho, ho!
082:53:43|O|CDR|What were the results?
082:53:45|O|CMP|Well - -
082:53:45|O|CDR|Or could you tell?
082:53:45|O|CMP|- - they're sort of inconclusive because I marked - see, they gave me -
082:53:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You can proceed to sleep attitude now. Over.
082:53:54|O|CMP|That's in work, Houston.
082:53:54|T|CMP|That's in work, Houston.
082:53:56|T|CC|Okay.
082:53:56|O|CMP|Hey, how about holding this for just a little bit?
082:53:57|O|CDR|Yes, let's hold this attitude a little bit; I want to look at the - -
082:54:02|O|CMP|Boy, that's beautiful out there, isn't it?
082:54:04|O|CDR|- - TPI approach. Man, this is really something; you ought to look at this. You want to watch our approach into the landing site; you got to watch right through this window. We're coming over - we just passed Mount Marilyn. We're coming up on Maskelyne series here - straight out ahead, coming into the landing area.
082:54:24|O|CMP|Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
082:54:24|T|CMP|Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
082:54:28|T|CC|Roger.
082:54:41|O|CDR|See the monocular -
082:54:44|O|CMP|I don't either, ...
082:54:46|O|CDR|Is there one?
082:54:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 82 hours 55 minutes. Our current spacecraft altitude 62.1 nautical miles. Our orbital parameter is essentially the same at 65.3, 53.9. So at 82 hours 55 minutes, we continue to monitor and this Apollo Control Houston.
082:54:53|O|LMP|Well, a crater - -
082:54:54|O|CMP|There go Sidewinder and Diamondback. God, if you ever saw checkpoints in your life, those are it.
082:54:59|O|CDR|But ... we don't get to see them.
082:55:00|O|CMP|You don't?
082:55:01|O|CDR|No, we roll over right here at this little - well, you see Boot Hill coming up right here?
082:55:08|O|CMP|Yes, yes, yes.
082:55:08|O|CDR|And just beyond it that's - that crater right on track there, the big one?
082:55:12|O|CMP|That's Mount Marilyn? Past Boot Hill?
082:55:15|O|LMP|No, Duke Hill.
082:55:16|O|CMP|Duke Hill?
082:55:17|O|LMP|No, I'm sorry ... that's Duke Island, Duke Island.
082:55:18|O|CDR|Duke Island.
082:55:21|O|CMP|Oh God, look at that Moltke; he's my favorite ... Look at that son of a bitch. You see all those roads - triangular roads leading right past him?
082:55:31|O|CDR|Yes.
082:55:32|O|CMP|That's US 1, I guess, huh?
082:55:33|O|CDR|Yes.
082:55:35|O|CMP|There's crater 130 over there although I can't quite see - see 129, but I can't quite see 130.
082:56:14|O|LMP|Can you see ..., Neil?
082:56:22|O|CDR|I'm not sure.
082:56:27|O|LMP|I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.
082:56:37|O|CDR|That far?
082:56:42|O|LMP|The one that's shorter there?
082:56:50|O|LMP|Houston, this is Apollo LM in the Eagle - Apollo 11 in the Eagle, and I got a beautiful view of the whole landing area.
082:56:50|T|LMP|Houston, this is Apollo ... in the Eagle - Apollo 11 in the Eagle. I've got ... for our landing area.
082:57:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You are breaking up badly. Say again. Over.
082:57:10|O|LMP|Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in looking out the left window in the LM.
082:57:10|T|LMP|Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in looking out the left window in the LM.
082:57:21|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Understand you can see the entire landing area looking out the LM windows. Over.
082:57:22|O|CMP|...
082:57:28|O|LMP|That's right.
082:57:28|T|LMP|That's right.
082:57:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. That was a report from Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin. He could see the entire landing area out the window. At 82 hours 58 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
082:58:08|O|LMP|Boy, that sure is eerie looking.
082:58:10|O|CDR|Isn't that something?
082:58:11|O|LMP|...
082:58:11|O|CMP|... enough of a shot down there, but you can't find a single spot on the surface that doesn't look ... 1-degree sun angle, that's - that's just a lousy sun angle.
082:58:30|O|CDR|That's spectacular out there - Looks like you're flying right into the side of a mountain, doesn't it?
082:58:34|O|CMP|Yes, sure does.
082:58:37|O|LMP|I missed taking a picture of it, ...
082:58:49|O|CMP|Well, that was good ... Shall we go to maneuver, I mean to sleep attitude - anybody object to doing that?
082:59:01|O|CDR|That'd be alright.
082:59:07|O|LMP|Okay, I'm ready for you cats to transfer to LM power. What time GET you got?
082:59:07|T|SC|...
082:59:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
082:59:15|O|CMP|80 - They're transmitting, Buzz.
082:59:19|O|CMP|83 hours. You ready to do it?
082:59:22|O|LMP|...
082:59:24|O|CMP|You ready to do it?
082:59:26|O|LMP|Stand by. Yes, go ahead and do it.
082:59:34|O|CMP|Okay.
082:59:35|O|LMP|You got 83 hours right now, huh?
082:59:38|O|CMP|Yes, 83 hours, and you're on LM power.
082:59:57|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got a lot of noise on the downlink. Would you please try your high-gain in wide beam-width, and the angles are 180 the yaw and pitch zero. Over.
083:00:29|O|LMP|Glycol pump.
083:00:30|O|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high-gain? Over.
083:00:30|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high-gain? Over.
083:00:34|T|CC|Roger, Mike. You're a lot better now. Over.
083:00:40|O|CMP|Okay. You want wide beam, for some reason?
083:00:40|T|CMP|Okay. You want wide beam, for some reason?
083:00:41|O|LMP|Will you cut my SUIT POWER and AUDIO, OFF, please?
083:00:44|T|CC|That's affirmative. We got you in the shadows, though. You are looking right down along the engine bell towards the Earth so we need you in wide beam. Over.
083:00:46|O|CMP|Yes.
083:00:54|O|LMP|Okay, fine.
083:00:54|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
083:00:56|O|CDR|Okay, going OFF now.
083:00:57|T|CMP|We're starting our maneuver to sleep attitude; Roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero.
083:00:57|O|CMP|We're starting our maneuver to sleep attitude; roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero.
083:01:03|T|CC|Roger. The angles you got in the Flight Plan will he good when you get there.
083:01:12|O|CMP|About ready to maneuver?
083:01:15|O|CDR|Go ahead.
083:01:18|O|CMP|Okay.
083:02:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 83 hours 2 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Currently we show an apolune of 65.3 nautical miles, a perilune of 53.9. We would expect the transfer to Lunar Module power to occur momentarily and from that point on the communications check with the Lunar Module. 83 hours 3 minutes and standing by, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:02:53|O|CDR|Yes?
083:03:09|O|CDR|You're past step 4?
083:03:44|O|CDR|Houston, 11.
083:03:44|T|CDR|Houston, 11.
083:03:45|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
083:03:47|O|CDR|What's the page?
083:03:50|O|CDR|Okay. We're on page activation 12 - 13, at step 4, and verify descent talk-backs gray, and they're barber-pole.
083:03:50|T|CDR|Okay. We're on page activation 12 - 13, at step 4, and verify descent talk-backs gray, and they're barber-pole.
083:04:05|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
083:04:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to take the low voltage taps OFF; RESET, then ON. Over.
083:04:22|O|CDR|Stand by. We've got it. We've just had – one circuit breaker out of position.
083:04:22|T|CDR|Stand by. We got it. We just had one circuit breaker out of position.
083:04:26|T|CC|Okay.
083:04:29|O|CDR|We have them gray now.
083:04:29|T|CDR|We have them gray now.
083:04:30|T|CC|Roger.
083:05:21|O|CMP|Watch that.
083:05:23|O|CDR|Don't we want it dark?
083:05:25|O|CDR|I thought the lights were going out. Man, that voltage is really falling off.
083:05:45|O|LMP|Hey, Mike.
083:05:46|O|CMP|Yes.
083:05:47|O|LMP|... VHF ... circuit breaker ...
083:05:53|O|CMP|I can't hear you, Buzz.
083:05:55|O|CDR|He says, "Why don't you turn on VHF B, just for kicks."
083:05:57|O|CMP|Alright, I'll do it. You going to send me some data?
083:06:03|O|LMP|Yes, I'll get right to it.
083:06:05|O|CMP|Huh?
083:06:05|O|LMP|I'll get right to it.
083:06:07|O|CMP|Alright.
083:06:09|O|LMP|Soon as I get some COMM first.
083:06:11|O|CMP|Yes, because when I - because when I record your data, I'm on SIMPLEX A.
083:06:19|O|LMP|Yes, well, that's when you're talking at the same time.
083:06:23|O|CMP|Yes, okay. You want me just to turn up B now?
083:06:25|O|CDR|There's signal strength.
083:06:53|O|LMP|Hello, Houston, hello, Houston; this is Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
083:07:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 83 hours 7 minutes now into the flight. We're now receiving data from the Lunar Module on our displays here in Mission Control Center.
083:07:24|O|CDR|A lot of static - on the Command Module S-band.
083:07:30|O|CMP|Well, we - we should still have him.
083:07:41|O|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check on S-band.
083:08:07|O|CDR|I'm not getting them on -
083:08:10|O|CMP|Well, we're almost at sleep attitude; just stand by 1, and, as soon as we get there, I'll find out where they are. I'm going to dick with the DAP right now.
083:09:15|T|LMP|... should have warmed up by now.
083:09:19|O|CDR|I've got nothing but static.
083:09:34|O|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
083:09:54|O|LMP|Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
083:09:54|T|LMP|Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
083:10:03|O|CDR|Mike, what are you transmitting on up there?
083:10:06|O|CMP|Say again.
083:10:07|O|CDR|What are you transmitting on up there?
083:10:10|O|CMP|I'm transmitting right now on OMNI A, but I'm about to get new high-gain angles; just 1 second. Okay, we're there.
083:10:18|O|CDR|How come I - he don't hear you on INTERCOM?
083:10:22|O|CMP|You should hear - -
083:10:23|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11; Apollo 11/Eagle. Over.
083:10:23|O|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11; Apollo 11/Eagle. Over.
083:10:29|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. This is Houston. We read you. Over.
083:10:35|O|LMP|Roger. I read you about 4 by 4. Could you give me a short count, please?
083:10:35|T|LMP|Roger. I read you about 4 by 4. Could you give me a short count, please?
083:10:40|O|CDR|Gees, I don't hear him.
083:10:40|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. Coming in with the short count - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out. Over.
083:10:46|O|CDR|We don't read them, Buzz.
083:10:48|T|LMP|That's alright.
083:10:49|O|CMP|He's - he's on LM S-band, Neil, apparently.
083:10:53|O|CDR|Oh.
083:10:53|O|CMP|Yes.
083:10:55|P|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin from the Lunar Module using the codename for the first time.
083:10:56|O|LMP|Roger. Are you copying my LOW BIT RATE? Over.
083:10:56|T|LMP|Roger. Are you copying my LOW BIT RATE? Over.
083:11:00|T|CC|Roger. We got some beautiful data here, Eagle. We're - All those guys are looking at it - systems guys. We'll have some word for you in a minute how everything looks.
083:11:10|O|LMP|Roger. I'm all ready to switch to HIGH BIT RATE, if that's okay with you.
083:11:10|T|LMP|Roger. I'm all ready to switch to HIGH BIT RATE, if that's okay with you.
083:11:14|T|CC|Would you please stand by, Eagle. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the COMM check. Over.
083:11:23|O|LMP|Standing by.
083:11:23|T|LMP|Standing by.
083:11:34|O|LMP|Houston, Eagle. We'll go ahead with the camera checkout. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
083:11:34|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. We'll go ahead with the camera checkout. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
083:11:43|T|CC|Stand by.
083:11:47|T|CC|That's affirmative. No problem on that, Eagle. You can go ahead and power up the sequence camera. Over.
083:11:55|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high-gain?
083:12:01|T|LMP|Should have done that before.
083:12:03|O|CMP|Blap.
083:12:04|T|CC|Eagle, be advised - sounds like a hot mike. Over.
083:12:06|T|LMP|Right. Yes.
083:12:10|O|CDR|Did you hear him answer?
083:12:11|O|CMP|No.
083:12:13|O|CDR|I didn't either. Buzz is reading him, though.
083:12:17|T|LMP|Roger. If you're reading me now, I am in hot mike because I'm in ICS push to talk, and DOWNVOICE BACKUP. Over.
083:12:25|T|CC|Roger. We just wanted to remind you. Over.
083:12:30|T|LMP|Thank you.
083:12:50|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Are you maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
083:13:03|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston. We have lost all the voice and data with Columbia. Would you see if he is maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
083:13:07|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high-gain? Over.
083:13:17|T|LMP|Hey, Mike. You maneuvering to sleep attitude?
083:13:21|O|CMP|Hey, how about asking them if they can hear me calling?
083:13:24|O|LMP|I don't believe they can hear you, Mike, ... sleep attitude.
083:13:24|T|LMP|I don't believe they can hear you, Mike. Are you maneuvering now to sleep attitude?
083:13:29|O|CMP|Well, we're in sleep attitude, and I got the high-gain angles, and they should be good angles. And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.
083:13:29|T|CMP|...
083:13:41|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. The Columbia has maneuvered to sleep attitude. He's got the high-gain antennas - antenna angles set in, and he should be communicating with you. Over.
083:13:41|O|LMP|Houston, Eagle. ... high-gain ...
083:13:56|T|CC|Roger. We don't have him. Stand by.
083:14:02|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Would you please have Columbia put in COMMAND RESET? Over.
083:14:13|O|CDR|Wilco
083:14:13|T|CMP|Wilco.
083:14:12|O|CMP|What'd he say?
083:14:15|T|CDR|COMMAND RESET.
083:14:15|O|CDR|COMMAND RESET.
083:14:16|O|CMP|Okay.
083:14:23|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Since we're in sleep attitude, I'll give you another long count. If you're reading in this mode, we'd like you to switch to high bit rate. Over.
083:14:38|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead with your short count.
083:14:41|T|CC|Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. We're reading you five by. You can go to high bit rate now. Over.
083:14:42|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear.
083:14:56|T|LMP|Roger. Going to high bit rate now.
083:15:33|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
083:15:41|T|LMP|Houston, this is Eagle. Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
083:15:45|T|CC|Roger. Reading you five by also, Buzz, and we got the high bit rate. It's looking beautiful through Goldstone. Giving you a count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Please give us a count. Over.
083:16:05|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Eagle with a count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Over.
083:16:15|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We're reading you five by. Over.
083:16:23|T|LMP|Okay. I'm ready to go S band voice. Over.
083:16:27|T|CC|Stand by, Eagle. Stand by on step 4.
083:16:41|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. A voice count exchange between Buzz Aldrin and the Eagle, the Lunar Module and Charles Duke here in Mission Control Center.
083:16:55|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 and ACCEPT. We've got a load for you. Break. Eagle, we're ready to go to step 4. Please select S band voice to VOICE. Over.
083:17:53|T|CC|Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. How do you read - normal voice? Over.
083:18:00|T|LMP|Eagle - Houston, this is Eagle. Read you loud and clear on S band, normal voice. How me? Over.
083:18:06|T|CC|Roger. You're beautiful in this mode, Buzz. We're reading you five by. Coming with a short count and we'd like one back from you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out.
083:18:28|T|LMP|Roger. Houston, Eagle. You're gorgeous also. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle, over.
083:18:39|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. This is better than the downvoice backup. Stand by 1.
083:18:55|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Everybody's happy as a clam with this mode. We'd like to stay here for a little bit. Telemetry looks great, and the; voice is great. Over.
083:19:09|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. I'm checking out camera number 4 now.
083:19:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. Our communications check out with the Eagle apparently going very well at this time.
083:19:25|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Say again what you're checking out? Over.
083:19:35|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Eagle has checked out both 70 millimeter cameras and both 16 millimeter cameras, and all work fine. Over.
083:19:46|T|CC|Sounds great. Stand by.
083:19:57|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We've looked over your systems on the high bit rate. Everything looks super; we're ready to go. Over.
083:20:10|T|LMP|Roger. Stand by. You want to go back to low bit rate now?
083:20:13|T|CC|Stand by on that. Over.
083:20:28|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We look good through the 210 on this mode. We're going to shift data select to an 85 foot dish to see what we've got, and then we'll be back to you on the 210. If you'll stand by a couple of minutes in this mode, we'll be back with you. Over.
083:20:48|T|LMP|Roger. Eagle standing by.
083:21:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours, 21 minutes are now in to the flight. Meanwhile, aboard the Eagle, apparently Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, although Buzz is doing most of the comm check at this time.
083:21:36|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. How do you read? Over.
083:21:53|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Read you loud and clear. Over.
083:21:55|T|CC|Roger. We're reading you five by. We've got the voice good through the 85; the telemetry is in and out through the 85. Stand by. We'll be back with you through the 210. Over.
083:22:28|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. You can go step 5 now. We'd like low bit rate. Over.
083:22:40|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. You have low bit rate.
083:22:44|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Eagle.
083:22:59|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Could you give me a short count - this mode? Over.
083:23:07|T|LMP|Houston, this is Eagle with a short count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle. Over.
083:23:15|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. You're five by. This S band voice is really beautiful. Over.
083:23:26|T|CC|And, Eagle, Houston. We'll be standing by in this mode for a minute or so. We'll be back with you if you'll just stand by. Over.
083:23:41|T|LMP|Roger.
083:25:00|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins, aboard Columbia, taking down a maneuver pad.
083:25:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours 34 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Lunar Module communications has been deactivated. We currently show a velocity of 5,377 feet per second. Our orbital parameters now read 65.1 nautical miles.
083:25:26|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston coming through the 210. How do you read? Over.
083:25:34|T|LMP|Roger. Read you loud and clear.
083:26:16|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston. We're happy with all our data in all modes. You can power down the COMM now. Over.
083:26:26|T|LMP|Roger. I understand. Eagle will power down the COMM, and we are just approaching 27 volts now. It looks like we won't have to bother with the high taps.
083:26:38|T|CC|Rog.
083:26:39|T|LMP|We're powering down. Out.
083:26:41|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.
083:26:44|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We got a TEI 11 PAD for you and an update on the water dump. Over.
083:26:53|T|CMP|Stand by one, Houston. Are you through with the DSKY?
083:26:56|T|CC|That's affirmative. Over.
083:26:59|T|CMP|Okay.
083:27:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours and 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. That last exchange between Charlie Duke, our Capsule Communicator and Buzz Aldrin, aboard the Eagle, identifying that we're very well satisfied with the communications check on the Lunar Module and will proceed with powering down the spacecraft. At 83 hours 27 minutes, we now read an altitude of 54.3 nautical miles, a velocity of 5,376 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:29:25|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Ready to copy TEI-11. Over.
083:29:28|T|CC|Rog, Columbia. Here we come with the TEI-11. SPS/G&N: 37200; minus 0.60, plus 0.47. Noun 33, 098:05:24.22; plus 4144.8, plus 0371.9, minus 0242.2. Roll is NA; pitch, 020; the rest of the PAD is NA. Set stars are NA. The ullage is two quads - correction, two jets for 16 seconds; use Bravo and Delta. In the comments, the undocked present CSM - correction, this is for - TEI-11 is undocked. Present onboard weight of the CSM is 37,200 pounds, about 50 Alpha on your DAP. Over.
083:31:16|T|CMP|Alright. I read back TEI-11. SPS G&N: 37200; minus 0.60, plus 0.47. Plus 098:05:24.22, plus 4144.8, plus 0371.9, minus 0242.2. NA, 020; the rest of the PAD NA. Ullage, two jets for 16 seconds, Quads B and D. Undocked. Present CSM weight is okay in the DAP.
083:31:49|T|CC|Roger, 11. And we'd like you to do a wastewater dump at 84 hours down to 25 percent. Over.
083:32:05|T|CMP|Roger. I understand. Waste water dump to 25 percent at 84 hours.
083:32:09|T|CC|Roger. And, Mike, we'll have LOS in about 11 minutes at 83:44. AOS is 84:30, and prior to - or at LOS, we would like you to go - Configure the S band for high-gain track to REACQ, high-gain beam to NARROW, and let's try that to see if we can get an automatic REACQ at the next AOS. Over.
083:32:42|T|CMP|Good idea.
083:32:46|T|PAO|That was Mike Collins, aboard Columbia, taking down a maneuver PAD.
083:32:51|T|CMP|I'm in REACQ and NARROW now.
083:32:53|T|CC|Roger.
083:33:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Also, that water that you got on the aft bulkhead, we - If it's not too much, we just recommend sopping it up and then throwing the sponges away in the waste stowage area. If it's too much, then we recommend using the procedure in the checklist on page F10-14. Over.
083:33:57|T|CMP|All right. Thank you.
083:34:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 83 hours, 34 minutes now into the flight, Apollo 11. The Lunar Module communications has - has been deactivated. We currently show a velocity of 5,377 feet per second. Our orbital parameters now read 65.1 nautical miles apolune, 54.2 nautical miles perilune. At 84 hours, 35 minutes, continuing to follow. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:37:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you have Buzz make sure he gives us the OPS pressure readings before you close up? Over.
083:37:34|T|CMP|Will do.
083:38:00|T|CDR|Houston, 11. The OPS read 5750, both bottles.
083:38:04|T|CC|Roger.
083:38:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 83 hours 38 minutes. Apollo 11 now on CSM power.
083:40:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 83 hours 40 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We're less than 4 minutes away now from time of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. At the present time, our velocity reading, 5,375 feet per second. Our total weight in orbit at this time, reading 70,502 pounds. Our orbital parameter's apolune is 65.1 nautical miles perilune 54.2 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:42:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 83 hours 43 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Less than a minute away from predicted time of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We expect the next time we acquire Apollo 11, it's crew, Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, will have begun their rest period. And at 83 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:43:24|O|CMP|Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow; I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is reinstalling all that claptrap up in there.
083:43:40|O|CDR|Yes.
083:43:42|O|CMP|But -
083:43:47|O|LMP|...
083:43:50|O|CMP|What?
083:43:51|O|LMP|...
083:43:59|O|CMP|Yes, forward's okay.
083:44:00|P|PAO|Apollo 11 has passed out of range with the ground, traversing now over the far side of the Moon. During this pass, we had an extremely successful communications checkout with the Lunar Module using its code name for the first time. Its code name of the Eagle. Buzz Aldrin performed the counting tasks in concert with Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator here on the ground, and at times Buzz's - Buzz's voice, we noted considerable enthusiasm for the way things are going, and at times Charlie Duke shared that enthusiasm. In its maiden checkout in communications, the Lunar Module Eagle, looked good. At 83 hours 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:44:15|O|CDR|I don't think that would be too horrible sleeping down there.
083:44:28|O|CDR|It's for sure it's not going anywhere; this one's bolted down two places - and this one is - -
083:44:35|O|CMP|You can try it. If we could find a place to put our legs back in there, it'll be alright.
083:45:13|O|CMP|See - it's going to be hard to get into that - sampler there.
083:45:19|O|CDR|No - no, that's alright. That's the place for it.
083:46:30|O|CDR|(Sneeze)
083:46:34|O|LMP|Okay, lights went out - except for all those radioactive ones in there.
083:47:13|O|LMP|Well, COMM's good. Son of a bitch might work.
083:47:22|O|CMP|Sure it'll work. Anything in a pretty cockpit like that is bound to work.
083:47:39|O|CMP|Well, I propose leaving the probe and drogue in here overnight. Save all - doing all that claptrap in the morning.
083:47:50|O|CDR|It's okay with me.
083:47:51|O|LMP|Fine.
083:47:53|O|CMP|You through in the LM?
083:47:54|O|LMP|How's that going to affect - -
083:47:58|O|CMP|Sleeping?
083:47:58|O|LMP|- - ...
083:48:00|O|CMP|I'll be glad to sleep over there, alright? I don't think it'll affect that; I'd rather sleep, I'd rather sleep with the probe and drogue than have to dick with it in the morning.
083:48:07|O|LMP|Alright, that's fine; I can have it there. I don't know how I'd get out, but - (laughter).
083:48:14|O|CDR|...
083:48:16|O|CMP|That's ..., alright.
083:48:26|O|LMP|Hey, you don't want to bring this one back? You on a weight-saving kick for the Command Module?
083:48:36|O|CDR|You want it?
083:48:38|O|LMP|Sure, you - -
083:48:39|O|CDR|There's room for the Hasselblad.
083:48:40|O|LMP|- - you got stowage space?
083:48:42|O|CDR|You can have it if you want it.
083:48:46|O|LMP|You got a place to fix things that rattle around?
083:48:51|O|CMP|Sure. Like hatches? ... if you'll take time to get out of the hallway.
083:49:01|O|LMP|Let's get some music.
083:49:03|O|CMP|Get out of my damn hallway, Aldrin, so I can put my hatch in and then we can all - -
083:49:06|O|LMP|How about these tapes?
083:49:09|O|CMP|Okay.
083:49:37|O|LMP|Okay, 85:50 IVT to the LM. What time is it now?
083:49:45|O|CMP|83:53.
083:49:51|O|LMP|I figure that as being 12 hours. About time for a Lomotil, huh? Well, not quite.
083:50:38|O|LMP|How about the systems stuff - to put the machine to bed. (music)
083:51:02|O|LMP|You go to REACQ and NARROW?
083:51:04|O|CMP|Yes.
083:51:07|O|LMP|So I guess the COMM's pretty well taken care of?
083:51:10|O|CMP|Yes.
083:51:11|O|LMP|Have you got the wastewater dump?
083:51:12|O|CMP|No, I haven't done that, but I will.
083:51:14|O|LMP|Let's see, I imagine we want to go out of VOICE? Or not?
083:51:18|O|CDR|Very, very - -
083:51:19|O|CMP|The whole bit they said.
083:51:22|O|LMP|Okay.
083:51:58|O|LMP|Lunar orbit asleep; (cough) S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE?
083:52:02|O|CMP|I did it.
083:52:03|O|LMP|Got that, huh?
083:52:04|O|CMP|Yes.
083:52:05|O|LMP|high-gain, REACQ, NARROW; antenna pitch angle - -
083:52:08|O|CMP|Yes, I did that.
083:52:09|O|LMP|- - that's all it says.
083:52:10|O|CMP|Okay.
083:52:12|O|LMP|Plus the normal configuration.
083:52:14|O|CMP|Doesn't it say anything about DOWN VOICE BACKUP - or any of that stuff?
083:52:17|O|LMP|(Cough)
083:52:33|O|LMP|No.
083:52:35|O|CMP|Okay.
083:52:38|O|CMP|Waste water dump, we'll wait until 84 hours; they may have the vent modeled or some crazy thing like that, so I want to be at the right time.
083:52:45|O|LMP|Alright.
083:52:48|O|LMP|Well, let's see, normal lunar configuration. Well, it is DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
083:52:52|O|CMP|Yes.
083:52:54|O|LMP|Well, let's get going here. PRIMARY, PRIMARY, HIGH, VOICE, (cough) PCM, RANGE, DOWN VOICE BACKUP, AUX TAPE, OFF; TELEMETRY to DATA; and UP TIM COMMAND to NORMAL; VHF A and B, OFF; RECEIVE only, ...; PCM/ANALOG, RECORD, FORWARD, NORMAL, NORMAL - that's okay, LOW - PRIMARY, REACQ, and NARROW.
083:53:55|O|LMP|Well, COMM's set.
083:53:57|O|CMP|Good.
083:53:58|O|CMP|I got to vacuum up some water and dump the wastewater tank, and we're about set.
083:54:06|O|LMP|Hey, I got a fuel cell - O2 - -
083:54:08|O|CMP|Hey, our water's about all gone.
083:54:10|O|LMP|Did they say anything about the O2 purge?
083:54:13|O|CMP|Must have gone into the LM.
083:54:14|O|LMP|Yes, I think it did; it went on the windows. They didn't say anything about it, huh?
083:54:19|O|CMP|No.
083:54:19|O|LMP|Well, I guess we'll do it then. Anybody get my - Well, heck, I guess we're really not through with them yet, are we?
083:54:37|O|CMP|I updated the LOS time in your -
083:54:40|O|LMP|Yes. I think I'll wait until we get them back again before doing the purge.
083:54:46|O|CMP|Okay.
083:54:50|O|LMP|Because, I don't know, maybe they want all that stuff done on the back side.
083:55:12|O|LMP|Well, I propose to give myself a little bit of a - a bath, but not to put that damn LCG on tonight. You never did ask them about the - about the ..., huh? I sure haven't found them.
083:55:41|O|LMP|I think we ought to do that.
083:56:00|O|CMP|Neil, you still got that tissue dispenser, the empty one?
083:56:07|O|CMP|Thank you.
083:56:28|O|LMP|What's baseline altitude? ... the altitude - descent altitude settings?
083:57:02|O|LMP|That's the - that's the last meal we eat before descent, huh?
083:57:12|O|LMP|Sure is.
083:57:27|O|CMP|Wowee.
083:57:29|O|LMP|95 - that's - 7 - got 10 hours. Whew!
083:57:45|O|LMP|Might whip out that piece of bread in there.
083:58:43|O|LMP|Through in the tunnel, Mike?
083:58:46|O|CMP|Oh, yes.
083:58:47|O|LMP|Okay, I want to get the lights out then.
083:58:48|O|CMP|Okay, ...
083:59:30|O|LMP|What are your dosimeters reading?
083:59:38|O|LMP|... up a little bit.
083:59:41|O|CDR|Mine says - 11012.
083:59:51|O|CMP|I can't read this little fart. Says 10013.
084:00:04|O|LMP|I think they all started out at even thousands. They had them each different so they could tell which was which.
084:01:14|O|LMP|Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll raid the pantry for some bite-size stuff.
084:01:25|O|LMP|I don't know when we'll get a chance to use it  maybe some time - -
084:01:30|O|CMP|Monoculars?
084:01:32|O|LMP|- - during the maneuvers.
084:01:33|O|CDR|Found it, huh?
084:01:33|O|CMP|We're going to take that into the LM.
084:01:38|O|CMP|Yes. Sure can.
084:01:56|O|LMP|...
084:01:59|O|CMP|... - ... novel and earn a million dollars.
084:02:20|O|CMP|Amazing how quickly you adapt - Why, it doesn't seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?
084:02:25|O|LMP|(Laughter)
084:02:26|O|CMP|Oh, that is weird!
084:02:27|O|LMP|- big crazy moon out there again, huh? Funny-looking thing.
084:03:13|O|CMP|Buzz, this crazy bracket goes right here. It's probably right the hell in your way, isn't it?
084:03:18|O|LMP|No, no.
084:03:19|O|CMP|Not in your way?
084:03:20|O|LMP|No, I can survive with that.
084:03:21|O|CMP|Alright, let me put it up there; it'll be one less thing to do in the morning. It's in backwards, but I don't think -
084:03:34|O|LMP|Well, if I don't need this thing anymore, I think It'll stow that one away. Systems are yours tomorrow?
084:03:45|O|CDR|Yes.
084:03:45|O|LMP|I don't know as we've got much to do; there's a purge.
084:03:50|O|CMP|Is it 84 hours yet? Yes, it is; I'm going to dump the wastewater.
084:04:37|O|CMP|You dumping?
084:04:38|O|CDR|Yes.
084:04:41|O|LMP|(Cough) Boy, it's a dusty vehicle in here. Man! But that view approaching the landing site is just fantastic right out - right smack out the window, you know that?
084:04:53|O|CMP|Yes.
084:04:54|O|LMP|Except there's such a big shadow being cast by everything - -
084:05:00|O|CMP|1 or 2 degrees, Neil?
084:05:01|O|LMP|- - that I really couldn't - -
084:05:04|O|CMP|I think ... - -
084:05:05|O|LMP|- - I could identify the Cat's Paw and I could identify the pair of craters right at the end, but I couldn't really make out the backward V nor the three little curved ones on one side - -
084:05:17|O|CMP|I didn't see the backwards either.
084:05:18|O|LMP|- - but I could see the area where it all was, you know, and - -
084:05:20|O|CMP|Yes, yes.
084:05:21|O|LMP|- - it didn't go any farther back that this, and it didn't really go any farther forward than that - it really didn't. You know, it was rougher than a cob (laughter).
084:05:27|O|CMP|Rougher than a cob, but I didn't see ...
084:05:31|O|LMP|Well, when you compare it with the surrounding areas, why it's - it's pretty reasonable.
084:07:21|O|LMP|You want this somewhere?
084:07:23|O|CMP|...
084:07:23|O||(Music: John Stewart - Mother Country)
084:07:42|O|CMP|If you don't mind, I'll put it on this big piece of Velcro over here by the fuel cell.

084:28:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 84 hours and 28 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We're less than 2 minutes away now from our scheduled time of acquisition with Apollo 11. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center, Astronaut Owen Garriott has now replaced Charlie Duke as our Capsule Communicator. We expect that some final advisories will be passed to the Apollo 11 crew, and final report says such as crew status will be received from Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin prior to the start of their sleep period. A little over - we're a little over a minute away now from scheduled time of acquisition. We'll continue to keep the line up and continue to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:28:27|O||(Music: Tennessee Ernie Ford - Take My Hand, Precious Lord)
084:29:37|P|PAO|Mark 30 seconds now from time of scheduled acquisition.
084:29:47|P|PAO|Mark 20 seconds.
084:29:57|P|PAO|10 seconds. We should be acquiring shortly and we're standing by.
084:30:38|P|PAO|We have data - we've acquired data on Apollo 11.
084:31:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. Owen Garriott getting ready to place a call.
084:31:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
084:31:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
084:31:21|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACQ went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.
084:31:39|T|CMP|Go ahead, Owen.
084:31:41|T|CC|Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.
084:32:18|T|LMP|Roger. Understand that. Thank you.
084:32:21|T|CC|Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.
084:33:07|T|CMP|Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.
084:33:23|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.
084:33:35|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
084:33:36|T|CC|They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.
084:34:17|T|CMP|Okay.
084:34:17|T|LMP|How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?
084:34:22|T|CC|I'll have to stand by just a moment.
084:34:27|T|LMP|Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging battery A.
084:35:28|T|CC|11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.
084:35:43|T|LMP|Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning; I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.
084:35:53|T|CC|That's fine, Buzz.
084:35:54|T|LMP|Terminate battery charging now.
084:35:56|T|CC|That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your CRYO tanks, would you get your O2 tank 1 and your H2 tank 2 heaters off? Over.
084:36:17|T|CMP|Okay. I have O2 tank heater 1 off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.
084:36:25|T|CC|That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.
084:36:44|T|CMP|Okay.
084:36:48|T|CC|One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11-9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top of - under tunnel at the top of page 11-9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.
084:37:39|T|CMP|Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.
084:37:46|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a pre-sleep check for us before you go to bed.
084:38:07|T|LMP|Rog. We're in the midst of cycling the O2 and H2 fans now.
084:38:11|T|CC|Roger.
084:38:21|T|LMP|And the radiation is as follows: CDR 11012, CMP 10013, LMP 09015. Negative medication. Over.
084:38:36|T|CC|Roger. Copy, 11.
084:39:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours 39 minutes now into the flight. That conversational exchange with Owen Garriott - here in Mission Control Center and principally Buzz Aldrin; however, Mike Collins did talk briefly about Program 22, the landmark tracking activity in which he performed. At 84 hours 40 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:41:55|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
084:41:57|T|CC|11, Houston. Go ahead.
084:42:01|T|LMP|Roger. We're thinking about taking the monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use. Over.
084:42:11|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit. Over.
084:42:21|T|LMP|Okay. You want to run that by with whoever might be concerned?
084:42:25|T|CC|I sure will.
084:43:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours 44 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current spacecraft altitude is now 64.3 nautical miles with an apolune 65.2 nautical miles; perilune 54.4 nautical miles. We show an orbital period of one hour 58 minutes 40 seconds on our displays. Current weight of the spacecraft in orbit 70,502 pounds. At 84 hours 44 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:47:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have apparently lost the high-gain lock. We would appreciate it if you would give us a help manually to try to re-lock up on the high-gain. Over.
084:48:08|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. ...
084:48:12|T|CC|11, Houston. Reading you very weak, still too far down in the noise to complete the full transmission. If you'd give us a hand on a manual re-lock, we'd appreciate it.
084:48:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight. We're receiving noisy data at this time. We've requested Apollo 11 to give us a manual re-lock. Standing by at 84 hours, 49 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:52:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high-gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beam-width. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.
084:53:08|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now?
084:53:10|T|CC|11, Houston. Loud and clear this time. How me?
084:53:17|T|LMP|Loud and clear. You faded out on your last transmission. Over.
084:53:22|T|CC|Roger. Are you in wide beam now?
084:53:29|T|LMP|Negative. I got you locked back on again REACQ and narrow.
084:53:33|T|CC|Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?
084:53:48|T|LMP|No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.
084:54:00|T|CC|We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.
084:54:38|T|CC|11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the limb for this passage. Over.
084:54:52|T|CMP|That's confirmed.
084:54:54|T|CC|Thank you.
084:56:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 56 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current apolune 65.1 nautical miles, current perilune 54.3 nautical miles. After receiving some noisy signal, Apollo 11 has locked back on in fine form. That was Buzz Aldrin speaking with Owen Garriott here in the Mission Control Center. I expect we will take a second look at why we had to lock on manually. As we receive any updates on this, we'll pass them along. We now read 84 hours, 57 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:04:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
085:04:44|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
085:04:45|T|CC|11, Houston. On your AUTO RCS SELECT switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected off. Is that correct?
085:05:05|T|CMP|Yes. Roger. That's correct.
085:05:06|T|CC|Roger.
085:05:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 85 hours 5 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We confirmed from the ground, following that conversation exchange.
085:05:59|T|CMP|How do they look to you now, Houston?
085:06:05|P|PAO|As was pointed out -
085:06:06|T|CC|11, Houston. We see them all disabled at this time. Thank you.
085:06:12|P|PAO|As was pointed out, quad, RCS quad Charlie is now disabled following that conversational exchange between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin. Buzz, the Lunar Module Pilot apparently, quite obviously still awake. 85 hours 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11 now continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:06:15|T|CMP|Thank you.
085:09:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
085:09:30|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
085:09:31|T|CC|11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.
085:10:04|T|CDR|Okay. We understand.
085:10:11|T|CC|11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.
085:10:26|T|LMP|Roger. We'll do that.
085:12:22|O|CMP|I have a bit of fruitcake left over from somewhere; if anybody wants some, here it is. ...
085:12:37|O|CMP|Let's have a little chewing gum. Anybody like some chewing gum?
085:12:50|O|CMP|40 - and 250.
085:12:50|O||(Music: Barbara Streisand - People)
085:12:54|O|SC|43 ...
085:13:28|T|CC|11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look onboard? Over.
085:13:37|T|LMP|Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and oh, about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.
085:14:19|T|CC|Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.
085:15:27|T|CC|11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.
085:15:39|T|LMP|Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.
085:15:57|T|CC|Okay. Thank you.
085:16:23|T|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier off a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.
085:16:35|T|LMP|Okay.
085:16:37|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 85 hours, 17 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. What you heard in the conversation between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin was following a communications check in which we secured the uplink carrier for some 30 seconds and waited to give it a period of time of approximately 3 minutes, to see if the spacecraft would reacquire. We appeared to reacquire in fine form on this first test. We will repeat it - this test a second time, delaying approximately 4 minutes before we place a call to Apollo 11. At 85 hours 17 minutes, we currently read an altitude - spacecraft altitude of 56.1 nautical miles. Present velocity shows 5,367 feet per second. At apolune 65 nautical miles, perilune 54.4 nautical miles. Present weight in orbit remains a static 70,502 pounds. Present time in orbit as shown on our displays, 1 hour 58 minute 40 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:17:03|O|CDR|- - 1000 pounds - ...
085:17:05|O|CMP|That'll bring some more junk back here.
085:18:46|O|LMP|Couldn't have done better myself.
085:20:06|T|CC|11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?
085:20:24|T|LMP|Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.
085:20:24|T||(Music: unidentified)
085:20:49|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was re-enabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.
085:21:12|T|LMP|No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.
085:21:37|T|CC|11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.
085:21:58|T|LMP|Roger. Zeroed.
085:26:37|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've run 2 tests thus far with the S-band antenna which has reacquired nicely on both occasions. We're standing by for further possible conversations with the crew at this time, we're some 15 minutes away from predicted time of loss of signal on Apollo 11. Currently we read an apolune of 65 nautical miles - a perilune of 54.4 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:27:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO2 filter as per Flight Plan in the last hour? Over.
085:28:01|T|CMP|No. We're still eating. We're about to do it. We'll let you know.
085:28:03|T|CC|Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. AOS is 86:30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.
085:28:25|T|CMP|Somebody will be up.
085:28:27|T|CC|Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.
085:28:42|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.
085:28:49|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you.
085:28:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 85 hours 29 minutes now into the flight. That was Mike Collins reporting to the Capsule Communicator Owen Garriott that the Apollo 11 crew completing dinner at this time. And earlier perhaps as you listened to the air/ground, you heard some music in the background, soft music which would indicate that the this was being played in concert with their evening meal. When we reacquire, we expect one of the three crew members to still be, at least one to be still awake as we run a further check on our spacecraft antenna. At 85 hours 30 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:40:03|O|CMP|It may be raunchy later.
085:40:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:40:06|O|LMP|It may be? There's no doubt about it!
085:40:09|O|CDR|Oh, I'll take a couple small ones.
085:40:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and AOS will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over.
085:40:19|O|CDR|We'll see you on the other side.
085:40:20|T|CDR|We'll see you on the other side.
085:40:21|T|CC|Roger.
085:40:31|P|PAO|85 hours 40 minutes at this time. That - perhaps the last conversation we'll have with Apollo 11 until we reacquire. We're now 1 minute, 20 seconds away from loss of signal, continuing to stand by. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours, 41 minutes.
085:40:45|O|CMP|Anybody have one?
085:40:46|O|CDR|I'll have a little one.
085:40:48|O|CMP|Okay. Here you are.
085:41:28|O|LMP|Yes.
085:41:29|O|CDR|Okay.
085:41:47|O|LMP|I guess what I'm doing I should do with the paper towels.
085:42:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We've had loss of signal as the Apollo 11 spacecraft begins its pass around the far side of the Moon at 85 hours, 42 minutes.
085:42:56|O|CDR|Everybody through with the water?
085:43:00|O|LMP|Yes, go ahead.

085:44:13|O|LMP|Gosh, you remember when they told us about - about putting buttons on the seat of these pants?
085:44:27|O|CDR|No, I don't remember.
085:44:33|O|LMP|Yes, they were working out - this elaborate scheme.
085:44:38|O|LMP|Yes, ... had a choice between ... and Velcro.
085:44:52|O|CMP|What's its use? I mean, don't keep me hanging in suspense.
085:44:55|O|LMP|Well, whatever I chose, they didn't give me.
085:44:57|O|CDR|Shouldn't have anything.
085:44:59|O|LMP|Nothing in it.
085:45:01|O|CDR|Good grief, man!
085:45:02|O|CMP|They tell me you got to use Velcro on there. Maybe on the other side.
085:45:07|O|CDR|Use -
085:45:12|O|CDR|I got a - pair of jockey shorts. Now cut - cut the lights off - lights off.
085:45:27|O|CMP|Very good, very good.

085:51:58|O|CMP|You open up the outer one, and you put the inner one in there and squeeze it and it breaks, then you got to take the ... and insert it and mush it all up - to get that stuff evenly distributed through it.
085:52:25|O|CMP|Why don't you guys sleep underneath tonight? I'll sleep top deck.
085:52:34|O|CDR|Oh, you're going to sleep downstairs tonight, aren't you?
085:52:36|O|CMP|Yes, that's right; I remember ...
085:52:39|O|CMP|Unless you'd rather sleep up top, Buzz; I like - you guys ought to get a good night's sleep, going in that damn LM - How about - which would you prefer? Is that probe and drogue going to be in your way over there?
085:52:51|O|LMP|No, I don't think so.
085:52:53|O|CMP|Well, take your druthers, whichever you prefer.
085:55:57|O|CMP|Anybody ... goes right up here?

086:30:44|O|CMP|Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute, the TUNE FOR MAX needles have been wandering up and down and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just filling - finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off, and it'll be coming off in just a second.

086:32:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous REV. It looks like it was a receiver power supply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. Over.
086:32:34|T|CMP|Okay. Glad to hear it.
086:32:37|T|CC|11, that really winds things up as far as we're concerned on the ground, for the evening. We're ready to go to bed and get a little sleep. Over.
086:32:49|T|CMP|Yes. We're about to join you.
086:32:51|T|CC|Roger.
086:32:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 86 hours, 33 minutes. You heard that last exchange. The Mission Control Center has isolated our earlier loss of lock on with the S-Band antenna to a faulty power supply at Goldstone which in turn introduced noisy data causing a ground based receiver to go out of lock. This power supply, a 24 volt one, has already been replaced at Goldstone. In summary, the spacecraft looks good and the difficulty was caused here on the ground. At 86 hours, 34 minutes, we now read our orbit at 64.9 nautical miles apolune, 54.6 nautical miles perilune. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
086:51:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 86 hours, 52 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current altitude on the Apollo 11 spacecraft now reads 64.9 nautical miles. This corresponds with our apolune of 64.9 nautical miles. Our perilune on this pass 54.6 nautical miles. We've had no further conversation with the Apollo 11 crew nor do we expect to do so. We will take the loop down at this time and standby if any further conversation should develop. At 86 hours, 53 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
087:30:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 87 hours, 31 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 spacecraft continues on its frontside pass above the Moon. We're now less than 10 minutes away from loss of signal. The Apollo 11 crew in - currently in their rest period. We've received no indication yet that any of the crew members are actually sleeping, although all three appear to be in a very restful mode. This will be the final sleep period for the crew. Now at the threshold of their prime mission objective for the final sleep period prior to landing on the lunar surface and returning. The next scheduled rest period will in fact take place on the surface of the Moon. We are now past midnight Central Daylight Time. It is now July 20, the day scheduled for lunar landing. Our current orbital parameters read apolune 67. - correction 64.7 nautical miles, perilune 54.8 nautical miles. Current spacecraft altitude 54.8 nautical miles. Our time of orbit - orbital period remains the same 1 hour, 58 minutes, 40 seconds. So at 87 hours, 33 minutes, we will continue to standby in the event that we have any conversation with the crew. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
087:40:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo control Houston at 87 hours, 40 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 now less than a minute away from loss of signal as it is due to pass over the farside of the Moon and out of range with the mission Control Center as well as the rest of the world. We've had no further conversations with the crew. All spacecraft systems appear in fine shape. We're now less then 30 seconds away from time of loss of signal and standing by.
087:40:52|P|PAO|Mark 10 seconds.
087:41:04|P|PAO|We've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 passes over the back side of the Moon.
088:05:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 7
089:38:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 89 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming down - actually, we've had loss of signal on this, the seventh lunar revolution of Apollo 11. Should have acquisition again at 90 hours 25 minutes through the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station. The crew has been asleep about 2 hours, a little over 2 hours when the third man finally went to sleep, Mike Collins, after a brief interchange with the Ground. And 3 hours 57 minutes remaining in the sleep period. Cabin pressure now holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch at a temperature of 69 degrees Fahrenheit. Crew heart rates are running in the 40's. Apollo 11 presently in a lunar orbit with a pericynthion of 55 nautical miles, apocynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. Velocity in lunar orbit, 5,363 feet per second. Some 44 minutes 46 seconds until acquisition of signal, as the spacecraft comes around from the far side of the Moon on the eighth revolution. And at 89 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
090:02:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 8
091:36:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 91 hours, 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Less than 1 minute remaining until loss of signal with Apollo 11 as it goes onto the lunar farside in the eighth lunar revolution. Two hours remaining in the crew rest period, which means that midway through the next front side pass the crew will be wakened if they're indeed not already awake. Flight Surgeon, Ken Beers, reported just prior to the LOS in a brief exchange here in Mission Control that the crew apparently were all asleep soundly at this time and the Flight Director, Glynn Lunney, asked the spacecraft systems engineers how the two spacecraft looked as they approached the LOS point. Coming up on LOS now. Mark; loss of signal. The spacecraft systems were described by the systems engineers as being "looking good". 45 minutes to next - 45 minutes, 28 seconds to next acquisition of signal which will be in Ground Elapsed Time 92:23. 92 hours, 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. And at 91 hours, 37 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
092:01:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 9
093:29:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 93 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 5 minutes away from loss of signal of Apollo 11 on this revolution. And a wake-up call is expected from the spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans here in Mission Control just prior to the time the spacecraft goes into the - goes over the hill on the lunar farside. Standing by as we wait for him to make his call. Presently, Apollo 11 is in an orbit measuring 64 nautical miles at apocynthion, 55.5 nautical miles at pericynthion. Present orbital velocity around the Moon, 5,370 feet per second. Spacecraft calculated now to weight 70,321 pounds. Still standing by for the wake-up call. Standing by for Ron Evans big moment as he makes his call to the spacecraft. This being the sleep watch, his job has been rather easy or at least he hasn't had too much conversation with - here we go.
093:32:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11. Good morning from the Black Team.
093:33:01|T|CMP|Good morning, Houston.
093:33:03|T|CC|Ah, good morning. We got about 2 minutes to LOS here, Mike.
093:33:11|T|CMP|... You guys wake up early.
093:33:14|T|CC|(Laughing) Yes, you're about 2 minutes early on the wakeup. Looks like you were really sawing them away.
093:33:23|T|CMP|You're right.
093:33:44|T|CC|11, Houston. For planning purposes, you can go ahead and take the monocular into the LM with you.
093:33:55|T|CMP|Okay. I'll tell them. How are all the CSM systems looking?
093:34:05|T|CC|11, Houston. Looks like the Command Module's in good shape. Black Team has been watching it real closely for you.

We'll stay up live on the air-ground loop, and continue to monitor any further conversation between spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans, here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11, which at this time is likely in the middle of their breakfast period.
094:40:45|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control still standing by as the Apollo 11 - about a third of the way through the frontside pass on revolution number 10. Still in the midst of their breakfast period. Various console positions are preparing numbers for maneuver times, attitudes, and so on for the day's activity to pass to spacecraft communicator who in turn will pass them up to the crew. Probably during this pass - members of the white team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Kranz are drifting into the Control Room now to relieve the night watch - Black Team headed by Glynn Lunney. Glynn Lunney will hold a brief change-of-shift press conference in the Apollo news center in MSC after the handover is complete. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit for any further transmissions from Apollo 11.
094:49:59|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out almost all of the features we've identified previously.
094:50:09|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Sounds real fine. And, 11, I have your maneuver PAD and consumables update whenever you want them.
094:50:30|T|SC|...
094:50:34|T|LMP|Standby a little, please.
094:50:36|T|CC|Roger. We're standing by. And that's the block data on the maneuver PAD, by the way.
094:52:38|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11 is a couple of minutes away from this rolling right 40 degrees to roll 122, pitch 229, yaw 0. Over.
094:52:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We're standing by.
094:54:04|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
094:54:07|T|CC|Roger. Apollo 11, Houston. Here's your block data, TEI-30. Over.
094:54:19|T|CMP|Ready to copy.

094:56:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Readback correct. Your consumables update -
094:56:35|T|CMP|Yes. Go ahead.
094:56:36|T|CC|Roger. GET 91 plus 30, minus 7 percent; Alfa minus 8, Bravo minus 2.5, Charlie minus 10, Delta minus 6.5. H2 total, minus 2 pounds; oxygen total, plus 9 pounds. Over.
094:57:18|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. And onboard, we're reading for quad Alfa, 75 percent; Bravo 78; Charlie 78; and Delta 77 percent.
094:57:36|T|CC|11, Houston. We copy.
094:57:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I have your baseline altitude update now, if Buzz is ready to copy.
094:58:00|T|SC|...
094:58:01|T|CMP|Go ahead.
094:58:03|T|CC|Roger. Alfa 1 is 500, that's 500 feet above the landing site. Over.
094:58:22|T|CMP|Okay. Alfa 1 is 500 feet above the landing site. Thank you.
094:58:50|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Our crew status report for sleep: CDR 5.5, CMP 6.0, LMP 5.0. Over.
094:59:02|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We have that now.
095:05:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still up live with the air-ground circuit on the tenth revolution around the Moon. The crew reported that the Commander had 5 and a half hours of sleep during the night, Command Module Pilot, 6 hours, Lunar Module Pilot, 5 hours. Now 95 hours and 5 minutes into the mission. Another 27 minutes remaining in this pass 'til loss of signal. Continuing to monitor air-ground circuit. We'll leave it up live until loss of signal.
095:16:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
095:16:15|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
095:16:17|T|CC|Roger. The "Black Bugle" just arrived with some morning news briefs if you're ready.
095:16:26|T|CDR|Go ahead.
095:16:29|T|CC|Roger.
095:16:31|T|CMP|We're all ears.
095:16:32|T|CC|Okay. Church services around the world today are mentioning Apollo 11 in their prayers. President Nixon's worship service at the White House is also dedicated to the mission, and our fellow astronaut, Frank Borman, is still in there pitching and will read the passage from Genesis which was read on Apollo 8 last Christmas. The Cabinet and members of Congress, with emphasis on the Senate and House space committees, have been invited, along with a number of other guests.
095:17:08|T|CC|Buzz, your son, Andy, got a tour of MSC yesterday. Your Uncle Bob Moon accompanied him on the visit which included the LRL. Among the - -
095:17:26|T|LMP|- - Thank you.
095:17:27|T|CC|Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.
095:18:14|T|LMP|Okay. We'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl.
095:18:17|T|CC|Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Colombia.
095:18:40|T|CC|Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18, with black hair and eyes, and measures 34-1/2, 23, 34-1/2. First runner up was Miss Australia, followed by Miss Israel, and Miss Japan.
095:19:16|T|CC|While you're on your way back Tuesday night, the American and National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster.
095:19:45|T|CC|Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it's built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the oldfashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice".
095:20:30|T|CC|And the "Black Beag - Bugle" is all completed for the morning.
095:20:46|T|CDR|Thank you very much. We appreciate the news.
095:21:20|T|LMP|Black Team, we'll be looking for an interesting day with you all tomorrow.
095:21:25|T|CC|Roger. We'll be going off here shortly, and we'll pick you up in the morning for sure.
095:23:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 9 minutes 27 seconds remaining until loss of signal on this 10th revolution in lunar orbit. The crew is preparing, now that they've finished breakfast and gotten a lot of the other items out of the way such as the crew checklist and sleep status and so on, preparing for manning the LM for the second time and preparing for the day's activities which will culminate in landing this afternoon. Apollo 11 is presently in an orbit with a pericynthion of 55.7 nautical miles, apocynthion 63.8 nautical miles. Lunar orbit velocity 5,368 feet per second. We'll continue to standby on the air-ground circuit for the remaining 8 minutes of this revolution or until loss of signal. Ground Elapsed Time now is 95 hours 25 minutes, Apollo Control standing by.
095:30:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Three minutes to LOS; AOS at 96 plus 20.
095:30:25|T|CDR|Apollo 11. 96:20. Thank you.
095:32:37|O|LMP|I'll need to holler across to you to get the mission timers on. Do we want to check and get our two mission timers SYNC'd? What's this one read now? 82:50?
095:32:51|O|CDR|51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 - -
095:32:56|O|LMP|Okay, this one is 1 second slow down in the LEB.
095:33:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have apparently had loss of signal from the spacecraft. Here in Mission Control we are in the process of changing shifts. Flight Director, Gene Kranz and the white team of Flight Controllers coming on to replace Flight Director, Glenn Lunney. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. We'll reacquire the spacecraft again in a little over 45 minutes, coming up on the 11th revolution of the Moon. At 95 hours 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
095:33:29|O|LMP|Let's see, these things come in the Command Module don't they, those umbilicals?
095:33:34|O|CMP|...
095:33:43|O|LMP|Well, we don't want them.
095:33:50|O|CMP|...
095:34:01|O|CDR|Anyway, it compares.
095:34:04|O|CMP|...
095:34:13|O|LMP|Well, we couldn't do that without switching - well, you can have them in here all the time.
095:34:18|O|CMP|... there's no way for me ... probe and drogue ... docking ...
095:34:33|O|CDR|No, I can't think that that'd be of significance between them - because why would you ever care to whether you'd hook them up again, if you came back and docked?
095:35:29|O|LMP|Here's this LCG check. "Verify ... stick visible in red or green band."
095:35:40|O|LMP|Yes. Not ... as it should be.
095:35:47|O|LMP|The red one comes out this far, and the green one's out further than that. The whole thing is only about that long. It's got to be in one or the other or you can't see it.
095:36:24|O|CDR|Having any luck there, Michael?
095:36:27|O|CMP|...
095:36:41|O|LMP|You don't need to take - you're not taking your scissors over there?
095:36:43|O|CDR|No.
095:36:44|O|CMP|I've got ...
095:36:49|O|LMP|Well - ... pad; I'm going to have to take a leak here.
095:38:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 38 minutes. There will be a change-of-shift briefing following this shift. We estimate the briefing will begin in about 10 or 15 minutes in the MSC auditorium.
095:38:50|O|LMP|Yes, I guess I'd better take that pocket – and the purse. Tell you what - How about putting those tissues in that box that's got that spare camera in it?
095:39:16|O|CDR|Okay.
095:39:17|O|LMP|It'll be right handy on your side over there. Now where did the tissue box go?
095:39:39|O|LMP|You want to see if the computer agrees with that mission timer?
095:39:42|O|CDR|I did already.
095:39:44|O|LMP|Okay.
095:41:21|O|LMP|Can you hand me that purse and the - that bag of mine - and the checklist?
095:42:06|O|LMP|And if you'll take me off of suit power.
095:42:10|O|CDR|Okay. SUIT POWER is OFF; AUDIO is OFF. Whoops - Sorry.
095:44:21|O|CMP|...
095:44:24|O|CDR|Good.
095:45:07|O|CDR|About ready for a little help? ... that.
095:46:00|O|CMP|What's that?
095:46:04|O|CMP|... I only have one ... left.
095:46:12|O|CDR|Okay. Oh, let's see, one small - blah.
095:47:13|O|CDR|(Humming)
095:48:12|O|CDR|Okay.
095:48:57|O|CMP|You want one?
095:48:59|O|LMP|...
095:49:00|O|CMP|Yes.
095:49:02|O|LMP|...
095:49:42|O|CDR|We've got a roll rate in; 0.3-degree roll rate. Now it's taking it out; now it's taking it back out the other way.
095:50:33|O|CDR|... Now, let's see.
095:50:41|O|CDR|I'll keep an eye on ... for you.
095:51:03|O|CMP|... on here.
095:51:06|O|LMP|Okay, I'm going on.
095:51:07|O|CMP|Okay.
095:53:30|O|CMP|What's that?
095:53:32|O|CMP|Did you repress, huh?
095:54:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 11
095:54:23|O|LMP|How come you don't ... LM power?
095:54:26|O|CMP|Okay. Stand by. You're on LM power. What?
095:54:36|O|CMP|What did he say?
095:54:39|O|LMP|...
095:54:40|O|CMP|Oh, what time is it? It's 95:54.
095:55:11|O|CMP|Now, switch from RATE, HIGH, to RATE, LOW. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.
095:55:21|O|LMP|...
095:55:35|O|CMP|I guess that's right then, Neil; it rattles across the deadband at a fairly high rate.
095:55:43|O|CDR|...
095:55:46|O|CMP|Alright.
095:56:30|O|CDR|...
095:56:32|O|CMP|Sure as hell is.
095:56:48|O|CMP|I can't get that ...
095:56:52|O|CDR|This one - this one? That won't hurt it. ...
095:59:07|O|CMP|Stand by for some MASTER ALARMS; I'm purging.
096:00:28|O|LMP|...
096:00:30|O|CDR|Oh, ..., Mike.
096:00:34|O|CMP|It's 96 hours even. 96 even and coming up on 40 seconds. Ready -
096:00:40|O|CMP|MARK it.
096:00:48|O|LMP|...
096:00:50|O|CMP|Okay, 96:01 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
096:01:00|O|CMP|MARK -

096:01:03|O|LMP|3, 4, 5.
096:01:06|O|CMP|Good.
096:02:01|O|CMP|Okay, stand by for more thruster firing here.
096:04:06|O|CDR|Is this - -
096:04:09|O|CMP|No, this one's yours. You going to wear this for - -
096:04:11|O|CDR|...
096:04:12|O|CMP|Okay, I'm going to ... camera out of its way.
096:04:33|O|LMP|...
096:04:40|O|CMP|Okay, I wouldn't be surprised .... all over this goddam stuff.
096:05:00|O|CMP|A three-ring circus. I got a fuel cell purge in progress and trying to set up cameras and brackets, watch an AUTO maneuver, and -
096:05:22|O|CMP|Jesus Christ!
096:07:58|O|CMP|NORMAL, NORMAL.
096:09:19|O|CMP|Another MASTER ALARM coming.
096:10:51|O|CMP|Stand by for MASTER ALARM.
096:12:54|O|CMP|Neil, where's the voice tape recorder, you know?
096:12:58|O|CDR|Might be in the ...
096:13:01|O|CMP|Okay. Oh, you son of a bitch, you! God damn!
096:13:08|O|CDR|...
096:16:16|O|CDR|...?
096:16:18|O|CMP|Can't get it ...; it's behind the ...
096:16:27|O|CDR|Yes.
096:16:28|O|CMP|... hard time getting anything down here ...
096:16:37|O|CDR|Okay.
096:16:38|O|CMP|You got some things up there.
096:17:40|O|CMP|Neil, all this food and stuff up here, you going to take with you, or drink, or eat?
096:17:46|O|CDR|No, I'll take ...
096:17:53|O|CMP|Okay. Chewing gum, you want any of that?
096:18:06|O|LMP|... concerned ...
096:18:12|O|CDR|...
096:18:18|O|CMP|Neil, I hate to bother you; could you get my solo book out of R-1 there?
096:18:22|O|CDR|Pardon?
096:18:22|O|CMP|My solo book out of R-1.
096:18:27|O|CDR|Solo book?
096:18:28|O|CMP|Yes. Look - -
096:18:29|O|CDR|R-1?
096:18:31|O|CMP|Yes, it should be in R-1. Big frapping book, with a bunch of updates on the cover. Thank you, that's it. Appreciate it.
096:18:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 19 minutes. We are now less than 1 minute to reacquiring the spacecraft on the 11th revolution of the Moon. Flight Director, Gene Kranz since taking over the shift has gone around the room, reviewed the situation with all of his Flight Controllers. We expect that when we reacquire, Buzz Aldrin will be in the LM beginning the LM power up and check out. And he will be joined in a short while by Neil Armstrong. We'll stand by now for acquisition of signal as the spacecraft comes around the corner.
096:20:03|P|PAO|Network says we have acquired signal, we'll stand by for the call to the crew.
096:20:09|O|CMP|Neil, do you recall the highest rate you saw during this recent thruster activity? Did you say 0.4 or thereabouts?
096:20:18|O|CDR|What?
096:20:19|O|CMP|Do you recall the - any kind of body rates that you saw during that thruster activity? Didn't you say something about 0.4? Maybe – remember when the SCS was acting up?
096:20:30|O|CDR|Ah - -
096:21:24|T|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. Do you read? Over.
096:21:58|T|LMP|Hello, Houston, this is Eagle. How do you read? Over.
096:22:03|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston. Are you calling? Over.
096:22:09|T|LMP|Roger. How do you read? Over.
096:22:11|T|CC|Roger. Reading you about three by, Buzz; a lot of noise on the loop. We think it's coming from Columbia, but we can't tell. We're unable to raise voice with him. Would he please go to high-gain. Over.
096:22:26|T|LMP|Okay. I'll have him go to high-gain. It's probably the glycol pump you hear in the background, and I'm up to the point where I turn on the IMU. Would you recommend I hold off here for a few minutes or go ahead and power up the IMU? Over.
096:22:41|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
096:22:42|T|LMP|Hey, get your high-gain to working.
096:22:46|T|CMP|Houston.

096:23:59|O|CMP|Hey, Buzz? How about - -
096:24:44|T|CC|Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. We've got a noisy downlink on the downvoice backup. Would you please select S band voice to VOICE? Over.
096:25:50|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
096:25:57|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
096:26:00|T|CC|Roger. About three by, Mike. We've got a lot of noise in the background. It's clearing up now. Break. Eagle, Houston. Do you read? Over.
096:26:12|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. About four by four. Go ahead.
096:26:15|T|CC|Roger. Just getting a voice check. Say the page you're on in the activation checklist. Over.
096:26:24|T|LMP|Roger. I'm on page 27. Over.
096:26:27|T|CC|Roger. Understand 27. We copy. Out.
096:27:07|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 and ACCEPT. We have a state vector for you. Over.
096:27:16|T|CMP|Stand by one.
096:28:22|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You have P00 and ACCEPT, and how are you reading me now?
096:28:26|T|CC|Roger. Understand, we have P00 and ACCEPT. You're about three by in - on the voice, Mike. Over.
096:28:35|T|CMP|Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, and I'm configured for normal voice. If you've got any switch changes, let me know.
096:28:42|T|CC|Roger. We've got some noise somewhere in the system down here, I think. We're working on it. And I've got a 130 landmark update for you, and also a DAP load whenever you're ready to copy. Over.
096:28:59|T|CMP|Stand by one.
096:29:20|T|CMP|Go ahead with the 130 update.
096:29:23|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Coming at you with the 130. P1 is 98:37:35; P2, 98:42:44, 4 miles north. Over.
096:29:52|T|CMP|Okay. P1, 98:37:35; P2, 98:42:44; 4 miles north of track. And go ahead with your DAP load.
096:30:04|T|CC|Roger. CSM weight 36651, LM weight 33627, pitch trim minus 0.72, yaw trim plus 0.51. Over.

096:30:40|T|CC|Both are good readbacks. Out.
096:30:46|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Are you satisfied with the LGC self-test? Over.
096:30:53|T|CC|Roger. Understand. You passed the LGC self test. Over.
096:30:59|T|LMP|Negative. I was asking you if you were satisfied with it. As far as I can tell, it's satisfactory. And also the primary EVAP flow is actuated to number 1 at 96:05. Over.
096:31:11|T|CC|Roger. Copy on the primary EVAP. We've got the low bit rate, Buzz. We couldn't see that LGC self test. Over.
096:31:20|T|LMP|Okay.
096:31:27|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. The docking tunnel index angle remains unchanged.
096:31:33|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.
096:32:07|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle is going to secondary transmitter/receiver and secondary power amplifier, and I'll check with you in 60 seconds. Over.
096:32:16|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. We're standing by. Over.
096:32:23|T|LMP|Okay.
096:32:29|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We are through with the computer. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
096:33:15|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. On secondary transmitter/receiver and power amplifier, how do you read? Over. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
096:33:22|T|CC|Roger. Reading you five by, Buzz. How me? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Out.
096:33:30|T|LMP|Roger. That's about the same as before. Switching back to PRIMARY.
096:33:34|T|CC|Roger.
096:34:27|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Back on PRIMARY, and I'm ready to proceed with the steerable antenna activation.
096:34:34|T|CC|Roger. We're standing by, Buzz. Go ahead. Over.
096:34:46|T|LMP|And I'll go to BIOMED left - right momentarily.
096:34:50|T|CC|Roger.
096:36:23|P|PAO|LM communications engineer reports that we're on the LM steerable antenna. This apparently accounts for the quiet communications we're getting at this point.
096:36:40|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Got a real nice lock on - lockon on the steerable antenna, and you should be receiving BIOMED right and PCM high. Over.
096:36:54|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. We got you five by. It's really beautiful. We've got the high bit rate and the BIOMED. Out.
096:37:07|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Do you copy? Over.
096:37:14|T|LMP|Roger. Copy.
096:37:19|T|SC|You got CMP in IRIG-5 and LMP on IRIG-7.
096:39:26|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. For your information, we're doing the glycol pump check now.
096:39:30|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
096:39:44|T|LMP|And there's the secondary glycol pump.
096:39:47|T|CC|Roger.
096:40:26|T|LMP|And I'm on secondary, or number 2 pump right now, and I'll hold here for a couple of seconds and then switch back to number 1.
096:40:35|T|CC|Roger.
096:42:47|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
096:42:51|T|LMP|Houston.
096:42:54|T|CMP/LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
096:42:56|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. We noticed your DAP configuration. We'd like you to turn off B3 and C4, Mike, and for register 2 in the DAP, we'd like all ones. Over.
096:43:22|T|CMP|B3 and C4 are both off on panel 8 and I understand you want - Say again what you want on register 2.
096:43:29|T|CC|Roger. In the DAP, we'd like you load all ones. Over.
096:43:37|T|CMP|All right.
096:44:08|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Did you hit the COMMAND RESET around - after LOS on the last pass? Over.
096:44:19|T|CMP|That's affirmative. When we were having difficulty getting you, Charlie here, I pushed the COMMAND RESET to make sure I had control of high-gain.
096:44:26|T|CC|Roger. Thank you much. We're in good shape now. Over.
096:44:32|T|CMP|Okay.
096:46:19|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Can you tell me if you're picking up BIOMED on the CDR now? Over.
096:46:27|T|CC|Stand by.
096:46:44|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We're not getting any BIOMED from the CDR now. Over.
096:46:53|T|LMP|Roger. Understand.
096:47:59|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We got the BIOMED on the commander now. Over.
096:48:07|T|LMP|Very good. Thank you.
096:49:20|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. We're ready for an E memory dump if you are. Over.
096:49:24|T|CC|Roger. We're ready. Go.
096:49:59|T|CC|Eagle, this is Houston. We see the optics zero switch on. Before you take some marks, don't forget to cycle it back off and on, and then on. Over.
096:50:12|T|LMP|Roger. Houston, Eagle here. I wish we had one of those optics. I'll tell Mike about it.
096:50:18|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Excuse me. Sorry about that.
096:50:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Armstrong is now in the Lunar Module, in Eagle, and the LM activation and checkout appears to be going along very well somewhat ahead of schedule.
096:57:05|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Could you give us a hack on the time that you switched to LM power and also verify that we're on glycol pump 1. Over.
096:57:21|T|CDR|This is Eagle. We're on pump 1, stand by for the switchover time.
096:57:27|T|CC|Roger.
096:57:58|T|CDR|The switch time to LM power is 95:54:00. Over.
096:58:04|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Neil. Is Buzz back in the Columbia now? Over.
096:58:11|T|CDR|Yes. He is.
096:58:12|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
096:58:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have about 33 minutes left in this pass before loss of signal. Neil Armstrong confirmed that the LM power switch occurred at 95 hours 54 minutes, which would have put that activity about 30 minutes ahead of the Flight Plan's schedule, and that appears to be about the pace that the crew is holding, that Armstrong and Aldrin are holding and getting the LM activated and checked out. At this time Buzz Aldrin has returned to the Command and Service Module where he will be donning his pressure garment and then rejoin Armstrong in Eagle.
097:00:05|T|CDR|Hello, Columbia, this is Eagle on Simplex B. How do you read?
097:00:11|T|CMP|You are loud and clear in Simplex B, Neil.
097:00:14|T|CDR|Roger. Read you loud and clear.
097:00:25|T|CDR|Okay. Would you configure for Simplex A, please?
097:00:30|T|CMP|Roger. Going to Simplex A.
097:01:06|T|CDR|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read on VHF A?
097:01:09|T|CMP|Reading you loud and clear on A.
097:01:11|T|CDR|Roger. Read you loud and clear.
097:01:22|T|CDR|And I'm ready to get a time hack from you. Load the CSM time.
097:01:29|T|CMP|Okay.
097:01:43|T|CMP|Do you want the T EPHEM first?
097:01:47|T|CDR|Let's get your clock first and then we'll get T EPHEM.
097:01:50|T|CMP|Okay.
097:01:54|T|CDR|Give me a time for load.
097:01:59|T|CMP|97:01:30. Correction on that, Neil. 97 - make that 97:03:30.
097:02:24|T|CDR|Okay. I have 97:03:30 set in.
097:02:28|T|CMP|Okay. And you've got about a minute to go.
097:02:29|T|CDR|Okay.
097:03:15|T|CMP|15 seconds to go.
097:03:23|T|CMP|10.

097:04:09|T|CMP|Okay. 97:04:03.86.
097:04:20|T|CDR|Okay. I'm within three hundredths. That's within our ability to keep together, I think.
097:04:27|T|CMP|Right.
097:04:46|T|CDR|Okay. Now you want to give me T EPHEM VERB 05, NOUN 01 ENTER?
097:04:56|T|CMP|Okay. I've got VERB 05, NOUN 01, ENTER. Going to 17 06 ENTER.
097:05:00|T|CDR|Roger.
097:05:05|T|CMP|Are you ready to copy?
097:05:06|T|CDR|Go ahead.
097:05:08|T|CMP|Roger. Register 1, 5 balls; register 2, 20017; register 3, 20616. Over.
097:05:20|T|CDR|Understand R1, 5 zeros; R2, 20017; R3, 20616.
097:05:29|T|CMP|That's correct.
097:05:43|T|CMP|And I'm standing by configured to record your PCM data.
097:06:38|T|CDR|And I'm ready to start on a docked IMU coarse align when you are; and when you're ready, go MIN deadband ATT hold.
097:06:50|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
097:08:14|T|CMP|We're minimum deadband, attitude hold.
097:08:21|T|CDR|Okay. Now I need your NOUN 20.
097:08:31|T|CMP|Okay. I got VERB 06, NOUN 20. Give me a Mark on it.
097:08:37|T|CDR|Okay.

097:09:05|T|CMP|That's correct.
097:11:35|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. That coarse align looked good to us. Over.
097:11:40|T|CDR|Roger.
097:11:52|T|CDR|Okay, Mike. Your attitude hold's no longer required.
097:11:58|T|CMP|Thank you.
097:13:55|T|CDR|Okay, Mike. I'd like to copy a NOUN 20 again, 06 NOUN 20. Be on my Mark.
097:14:07|T|CMP|Standing by for your Mark.

097:22:50|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. Good readback. Out.
097:24:19|T|CDR|Houston, this is Eagle. Do you want us to go ahead and do a VERB 42 at this time?
097:24:28|T|CC|Stand by. That's affirmative, Eagle. We'd like you to go ahead and fine align. Over.
097:24:37|T|CDR|Okay.
097:24:48|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle, LMP. How do you read? Over.
097:24:49|T|CC|Roger. Five by, Buzz. How me? Over.
097:24:55|T|LMP|Loud and clear. I'm going to be going through an ascent battery check. You want to check my BIOMED's briefly? Over.
097:25:02|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
097:25:18|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We got a good BIOMED on you, Buzz. Over.
097:25:26|T|LMP|Okay. Let me know where it ought to be at this point.
097:25:29|T|CC|Roger. You can stay there at that point. When we go LOS, we'd like you to go off on the BIOMED. Over.
097:25:39|T|LMP|Roger.
097:25:53|T|CDR|Do you copy those angles, Houston - torquing angles?
097:25:57|T|CC|Roger. They're correct. You can torque. Over.
097:27:43|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have about 4 minutes LOS. That makes AOS 98 18. Over.

097:31:06|O|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. 30 seconds to LOS. Both spacecraft looking good going over the hill. Out.
097:32:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. We'll next acquire the spacecraft in about 46 minutes at a Ground Elapsed Time of 98 hours, 18 minutes. During that pass, Armstrong and Aldrin in the Lunar Module began checking out activating the Lunar Module, and they appeared to finish about 30 minutes ahead of the scheduled time in the Flight Plan. They began early and maintained the pace. Both spacecraft looking very good at this time, and everything progressing very smoothly. On the next revolution, revolution 12, the crew will continue activation and checkout of Lunar Module systems. The following revolution, Revolution 13, they will undock from the Command and Service Module. At 97 hours, 33 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
097:34:43|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
097:34:45|O|CDR|Go ahead.
097:34:47|O|CMP|Roger. I'm getting ready to preload the probe. I'm going to disable all my roll thrusters. Would you please monitor my roll, your yaw?
097:34:54|O|CDR|Roger.
097:36:41|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
097:36:43|O|CDR|Go ahead.
097:36:45|O|CMP|I got another "Verify capture latches engaged" on my checklist. I've already preloaded the probe; it's sort of silly, but sort of your option whether you want to verify they're engaged or not.
097:36:55|O|LMP|Okay, we got the hatch all latched up now, and we're getting ready for pressure-integrity check; so, why don't you go ahead?
097:37:02|O|CMP|Okay.
097:39:57|O|LMP|Mike, let us know how you're coming up there now and then.
097:40:00|O|CMP|I'm doing just fine. I've cocked eight out of the 12 docking latches, and everything is going nominally.
097:40:07|O|LMP|Okay.
097:41:14|O|CMP|All 12 docking latches are cocked.
097:41:17|O|LMP|Okay.
097:41:21|O|CMP|And I'm ready to button up the hatch.
097:46:46|O|LMP|Hey, Mike. Have you got the - got to the tunnel vent step yet?
097:46:53|O|CMP|I'm just coming to that. What can I do for you?
097:46:55|O|LMP|Well, we're waiting on you.
097:46:56|O|CMP|Okay.
097:46:59|O|CDR|We're still ahead of the timeline, so take your time.
097:47:02|O|CMP|Okay.
097:47:14|O|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to LM tunnel vent.
097:48:14|O|LMP|You got it all vented now?
097:48:17|O|CMP|Negative, it's a slow process. I'm on VENT, but - it's just going to take a little while here.
097:48:23|O|LMP|Roger. Just give us a call. We're pressing on with some other stuff.
097:48:26|O|CMP|Okay.
097:51:39|O|CMP|How's our attitude holding?
097:51:42|O|CDR|Looks good.
097:51:43|O|CMP|Okay, this - this thing's supposed to take about 8 minutes; we've got about 3 of them gone, so in about another 5 minutes, I should be able to turn my thrusters back on.
097:55:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 12
098:01:03|O|LMP|Moving in.
098:01:04|O|CDR|How you doing, Mike?
098:01:06|O|CMP|Doing just fine. The - Stand by, I'll give you the DELTA-P reading - 3.0; I need 3.5 before I can turn my thrusters back on.
098:01:16|O|LMP|Okay.
098:04:59|O|CMP|I've got a 3.5 psid now; I'm going to start a maneuver here in a few minutes ...
098:05:05|O|LMP|Okay.
098:05:12|O|CMP|How you - how you guys doing?
098:05:15|O|LMP|Okay. We're doing our regulator checks now.
098:05:21|O|CMP|So I heard.
098:07:21|O|CMP|I'm starting the maneuver.
098:12:08|O|LMP|How long you got - to end this maneuver, Mike?
098:12:12|O|CMP|Oh, about another 2 or 3 minutes we should be there - no, less than that.
098:14:02|O|CMP|We're there; we're at the new attitude.
098:14:08|O|CDR|Okay, we're going to put our gear down.
098:14:29|O|LMP|... MASTER ARM - -
098:14:34|O|CDR|Okay.
098:14:35|O|LMP|LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE.
098:14:38|O|CDR|Here we go, Mike.
098:14:46|O|LMP|Bam, it's out. Ain't no doubt about that.
098:14:51|O|CDR|And it's gray.
098:14:52|O|LMP|Alright. Your ED LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
098:14:58|O|CDR|LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
098:15:00|O|LMP|Alright, fire it again.
098:15:04|O|CDR|Okay.
098:15:05|O|LMP|Nothing happened, huh?
098:15:06|O|CDR|Right.
098:15:07|O|LMP|Okay, now - -
098:15:08|O|CDR|I heard it click.
098:15:09|O|LMP|Yes, so did I.
098:15:10|O|CDR|That relay, I suppose.
098:15:12|O|LMP|MASTER ARM, OFF.
098:15:13|O|CDR|It's OFF.
098:15:14|O|LMP|CB(11), ED LANDING GEAR FLAG, OPEN.
098:15:23|O|CDR|The gear went down okay, Mike.
098:15:26|O|CMP|Good deal.
098:15:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 16 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft in its 12th revolution of the Moon. At this time Armstrong and Aldrin should be completing pressure checks on their spacesuits. Coming up in this revolution, they will be running checks on the guidance platform of their LM guidance system. They will also be running checks on the Reaction Control System thrusters and their descent propulsion system, as well as the rendezvous radar. We will also be giving them the GO/NO GO for undocking in the following revolution. The checkout and activation of the LM up to this point has been moving along very smoothly. All systems performing well and we were ahead of the Flight Plan at the end of the last revolution. We will standby now to reacquire the spacecraft. The LM and CSM, still docked and Armstrong and Aldrin within the LM. That will be their home for the next 30 hours or so. Now about 45 seconds from reacquiring.
098:17:39|P|PAO|We are now about 15 seconds from reacquisition of Apollo 11. The spacecraft currently in an orbit with an apocynthion of 63.5 nautical miles and pericynthian of 55.9, as we are continuing to see the apocynthion drop and pericynthian raise as the orbit becomes more and more circular.
098:18:08|P|PAO|We should have acquisition of signals shortly. We will have some noise on the circuits until the LM ,steerable and the CSM high-gain antennas are brought into play.
098:18:38|P|PAO|Capcom Charlie Duke putting in a call to the crew. We'll continue to stand by.
098:18:21|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're standing by. Over.
098:18:40|O|CDR|Columbia -

098:19:45|O|CDR|Columbia, do you read Eagle?
098:19:47|O|CMP|Eagle, do you read Columbia?
098:19:51|O|LMP|Yes, I'm working on the high-gain right now.
098:19:54|O|CMP|Okay, I'm reading him loud and clear.
098:20:15|O|LMP|You in the right attitude, Mike?
098:20:17|O|CMP|That's affirm.

098:20:53|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. No voice. Will you verify forward OMNI? Over.
098:21:06|P|PAO|Charlie Duke asking the crew to verify in the LM that they are on their forward OMNI antenna. We are still awaiting lockup and a stronger signal. We will continue to have noise on the circuit until we get a stronger signal. We do have telemetry data from the spacecraft at this time.
098:21:52|O|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Over.
098:21:58|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We have no voice with Eagle. Would you please verify that Eagle is on forward OMNI. Over.

098:23:17|T|CC|Roger. Are you reading me, Buzz? Over.
098:23:20|O|LMP|Roger. I've got you now. I fed in those angles for the S-band, and I couldn't get a lockon; it appears as though the antenna would have to be looking through the LM in order to reach the Earth. Over.
098:23:22|T|LMP|Roger. I've got you now. I fed in those angles for the S band but I couldn't get a lockon because the antenna would be looking through the LM in order to reach the Earth. Over.
098:23:41|T|CC|Roger. We copied in the P22 attitude that you will not be able to get a high-gain lockon. We have a DAP data load, if you're ready to copy. Over.
098:24:04|O|LMP|Roger. Ready to copy.
098:24:05|T|LMP|Roger. Ready to copy.

098:24:49|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. That's a good readback. You're about two by with these OMNI's in this configuration; we won't have very good COMM until we get through with the P22. Over.
098:25:02|T|LMP|Roger. Understand.
098:25:02|O|LMP|Roger. Understand.
098:25:12|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Do you read?

098:26:06|T|CMP|Affirmative. Downvoice backup. How do you read me?
098:26:08|T|CC|Roger. Better, Mike. We're reading you now about four by. No voice at all with you earlier. Let's stay in this configuration. Eagle, are you in VOICE mode? Over.
098:26:20|O|LMP|Roger. Eagle's in VOICE mode. How do you read? Over.
098:26:22|T|LMP|Roger. Eagle is in VOICE mode. How do you read? Over.
098:26:25|T|CC|Roger. You're about three by now, Buzz. We're satisfied with this COMM configuration. Let's stay with where we are. Over.
098:26:34|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia's in OMNI C, Charlie, DOWN VOICE BACKUP and, when you get a chance, could you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have conflicting information between my cue card and my Flight Plan. I'd like to know which coordinates you want me to use.
098:26:36|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia is in OMNI Charlie downvoice backup, and if you get a chance, would you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have been - conflicting information between my cue card and my Flight Plan. I'd like to know which coordinate values you want me to use.

098:27:54|O|CMP|Thank you, Houston.
098:27:56|T|CMP|Thank you, Houston.
098:29:00|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. The coordinates you have loaded in P22 are - we have - are Site 130 prime. Do you concur? Over.
098:29:14|O|CMP|Yes, I had the coordinates loaded off the cue card which is - for crater 130.
098:29:17|T|CMP|I have the coordinates loaded on the cue card which are for crater 130.
098:30:03|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We made an error on those coordinates. We'd like you to load for latitude in a NOUN 89 plus 01 243, longitude over 2 plus 11 844, altitude minus 001 46 as shown in the Flight Plan. Over.
098:31:29|O|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
098:31:30|T|CMP|Okay, Houston.
098:33:06|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Could you give us an idea where you are in the activation? Over.
098:33:11|O|LMP|Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT before we can proceed on with the AGS, and we need you to watch our DAP data load, gimbal drive check, and throttle test. Over.
098:33:13|T|LMP|Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT, a reading on the AGS. And we need you to watch our DAP load, give a voice check, and throttle check. Over.
098:33:34|T|CC|Roger. Eagle, we'll have the state vectors and the REFSMMAT as soon as we get the high-gain. Over. It will be about another 10 minutes or so before we get throug the P22, and when we maneuver to attitude and get the high-gain, we'll have the updates for you. Over.
098:33:54|O|LMP|Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and the throttle check since we don't have a gimbal drive test, okay?
098:33:56|T|LMP|Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and throttle ... check if you don't have the gimble drive check, okay?
098:34:04|T|CC|Roger. Understand you're going to the DAP throttle check. That's affirmative.
098:35:31|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Those T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
098:35:32|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. These T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
098:35:37|T|CC|Say again. Over.
098:35:40|O|CMP|I say, the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, affirmative?
098:35:42|T|CMP|I say the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, don't they?

098:37:58|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle.
098:38:00|P|PAO|Mike Collins reporting that he has completed the marks for landmark tracking. We also got a report from the LM that they have deployed the landing gear, and that report came at 98 hours 45 minutes.
098:38:01|T|CC|Go ahead, Eagle. Over.
098:38:03|O|LMP|Roger. In accordance with the - page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and MODE CONTROL, PGNS, AUTO; and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet, so when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now - why, we got an RCS TCA light, and we've got four out of the eight other bright-colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in - PGNS and AUTO and just unable to fire the thrusters. Over.
098:38:05|T|LMP|Roger. In the first of - on page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and mode control PGNS AUTO and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet. So when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now, so we've got an RCS TTA light and we've got four out of the eight other bright colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in PGNS and AUTO and unable to fire the thrusters.
098:38:51|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
098:39:13|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. You are correct. The lights are there and the flags because we haven't closed the breakers yet. Over.
098:39:21|O|LMP|Roger.
098:39:23|T|LMP|Roger.
098:40:00|O|CDR|Houston, Eagle. Are you going to need the high-gain before you can look at our GDA position indicators?
098:40:02|T|CDR|And Houston, Eagle. Are you going to use the high-gain before you can look at our GDA position indicator?
098:40:12|T|CC|Stand by.
098:40:35|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We can see all the throttle data - -
098:40:35|O|CDR|I can go to a high ...
098:40:37|T|MS|I can give high ...
098:40:40|T|CC|Go ahead. Over.
098:40:41|O|LMP|I can give you HIGH BIT RATE on the OMNI's if that will help you any.
098:40:43|T|CDR|I could give you high bit rate on the OMNI if that would help any.
098:40:47|T|CC|Negative. We have all the throttle data we need. You can stay low bit rate. You can proceed through the throttle test, but do not do the gimbal trim. Over. Repeat, do not do the gimbal trim.
098:40:59|O|CDR|Roger. Understand.
098:41:01|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
098:41:39|O|CMP|Boy, you just can't miss those checkpoints – those Diamondback and Sidewinder.
098:41:41|T|CMP|Boy, you just can't miss those check points, Diamondback and Sidewinder.

098:49:45|O|LMP|Roger. Columbia, Eagle. Have you about maneuvered there, yet?
098:49:47|T|LMP|Roger. ...
098:49:52|O|CMP|Negative.
098:49:59|O|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Are those angles for after the maneuver that Columbia is going to make or are they for right now? Over.
098:50:14|O|CMP|We have about another 120 degrees to go, Buzz.
098:50:16|T|LMP|Stand by about another ...

098:51:13|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. I think I've got you on the high-gain antenna now. AGS are go.
098:51:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. If you go to REACQ on the high-gain, we can acquire you now. Over.
098:52:24|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We got some loads for you if you'll give us P00 and DATA. Over.
098:52:30|O|CMP|You've got P00 and DATA.
098:52:32|T|LMP|You've got P00 and DATA.

098:55:03|T|CC|As soon as we finish the uplink. Stand by one. Over.
098:55:11|T|CDR|Okay.
098:55:45|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Comment on P22. Worked just fine. The crater I marked on is a small crater down inside crater 130 as described by John Young.
098:55:57|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
098:56:06|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. On our load - during our load, we had to do a VERB 96 to stop integration. We're going to start over again on this load. Over.
098:56:19|T|CDR|Eagle. Roger.
098:56:22|T|LMP|And, Eagle, here. I have read out address in the AGS 404, 405 and 406, and I had believed that 405 and 406 would both be all zeros, and I would propose maybe that I reset them to zero. I realize that 404 should be a negative number, and it is minus 13495. Over.
098:56:51|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
098:57:23|T|CC|Eagle, Housten. Over.
098:57:28|T|LMP|Go ahead.
098:57:31|T|CC|Buzz, we've got - The only thing we're missing here is the drift check. After we finish our load, we'd like you to do the drift check with Columbia. Over.
098:57:44|T|CDR|GO.
098:58:05|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. The 404, 405, 406 look fine to us. Over.
098:58:18|T|LMP|Roger. I am going to be setting them up to zero for the undocking. The question is do you want me to reset 404, 405, 406 back to the numbers that they are now, or can I leave them zero? I intend to set 404 to a minus 13495. Over.
098:58:38|T|CC|Stand by.
098:59:33|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We would like you to zero, as called out in the timeline, all three addresses, 404, 405, 406, before undocking. After docking you can load them hack to the values that you have right now. Over.
098:59:54|T|LMP|Eagle. Roger.
099:00:13|T|LMP|And, Houston, Eagle here. Both RCS helium pressures are reading 2900. Over.

099:01:30|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Over.
099:01:35|T|LMP|Go ahead.
099:01:36|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. There seems to be some confusion here on 405 and 406. We'd like you to zero them out prior to undocking, and after undocking you can - we'd like them still zeroed. Over.
099:01:52|T|LMP|Roger. I agree with that. Thank you.
099:01:55|T|CC|Yes.
099:03:25|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We've got the load in the - We have reselected P00; your integration is going again for you; the computer is yours. We'd like to do the drift check now. Over.
099:03:37|T|CDR|Roger. In work.
099:03:39|T|CDR|Columbia, let's flick it in 0620 when you are ready.

099:16:31|T|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. Let me know when you come to your RCS hot fire checks so I can disable my roll.
099:16:37|T|CDR|Wilco.
099:16:38|T|LMP|Roger. We're right there now. And we'd like you - CSM in MID deadband ATT hold. Over.
099:16:44|T|CMP|That's where I am.
099:16:46|T|LMP|And, Houston, you have high bit rate with us now, I believe? We're ready to proceed with the RCS checks.
099:16:54|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. We're standing by. We're ready. Over.
099:18:57|T|LMP|Columbia, we'd like wide deadband ATT hold. Over.
099:19:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have less than 10 minutes now until loss of signal on the twelfth revolution. Before losing contact with the spacecraft, we'll be passing along a GO-NO/GO decision for undocking. That will occur early on the next revolution just prior to reacquiring the spacecraft. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, is going around the Control Center talking to his Flight Controllers. We're viewing status in preparation for making the GO-NO/GO decision for undocking.
099:19:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. We'll reacquire the spacecraft again on the thirteenth revolution in about 45 minutes. At the
099:19:00|P|PAO|end of this pass, we passed along the GO for undocking. That maneuver will occur just before we reacquire the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution and will be followed in about 30 minutes later by a small separation maneuver performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module. Checkout of the LM has been going extremely well up to now ahead of schedule. Both vehicles look very good. At 99 hours, 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
099:19:02|T|CMP|Okay. Going wide deadband ATT hold.
099:19:12|T|CMP|You got it.
099:19:17|T|CMP|Are you going to do your hot fire now?
099:19:20|T|LMP|Roger.
099:19:21|T|CMP|Okay. I'm disabling my roll.
099:19:31|T|CMP|Roll is disabled.
099:19:34|T|LMP|Roger.
099:21:07|T|CMP|Roger. Would you believe you've got thrusters onboard that vehicle.
099:22:04|T|CMP|Give me a call just as soon as your hot fire is complete, please.
099:22:09|T|CDR|Wilco.
099:24:13|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. The RCS hot fire is complete. How did you observe it? Over.
099:24:18|T|CC|Stand by. Eagle, Houston. The RCS hot fire looks super to us. We're all GO.
099:24:32|T|LMP|Roger. Mike, would you confirm that thrusters B3 and C4 are off? Over. And your radar transponder off.
099:24:42|T|CMP|C4 is off; B3 is off. Transponder is to HEATER which is the same as being off, and I've got my roll jets back on now.
099:24:50|T|CDR|And you're maneuvering. Right?
099:24:53|T|CMP|Will be shortly, Neil.
099:25:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're GO for undocking. Over.
099:25:08|T|LMP|Roger. Understand.
099:26:39|T|CMP|Starting a trim maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
099:28:05|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia.
099:28:07|T|CC|Go ahead, Columbia. Over.
099:28:12|T|CMP|Roger. There will be no television of the undocking. I have all available windows either full of heads or cameras, and I'm busy with other things.
099:28:19|T|CC|We concur. Over.
099:28:23|T|CMP|Okay.
099:28:24|T|CC|And, Eagle, Houston. We'd like you to select aft OMNI now. It will be good for both LOS and AOS. Over.
099:28:33|T|LMP|Roger. Going to aft OMNI.
099:29:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS.
099:29:11|O|CMP|Columbia, out.
099:29:13|T|CMP|Columbia. Roger.
099:29:16|O|CMP|All Columbia systems looking good.
099:29:18|T|CDR|... Columbia. Systems looking good.
099:31:42|O|CMP|It's nice and quiet over here, isn't it?
099:31:56|O|CMP|Eagle, you read Columbia?
099:31:58|O|LMP|Roger. Loud and clear.
099:32:03|O|CMP|Okay, everything's going well. Everything's quiet over on this side.
099:32:07|O|LMP|You bet.
099:32:09|O|CMP|Okay. I'm standing by to record your data anytime it's convenient for you; angles coming up in another 2 minutes.
099:32:31|O|LMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to B DATA now.
099:32:35|O|CMP|Roger and out.
099:33:00|O|LMP|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
099:33:04|O|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Buzz.
099:33:06|O|LMP|Very good.
099:33:10|O|CMP|...
099:34:48|O|LMP|Mike, are you in AGS CAL attitude now?
099:34:54|O|CMP|That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS CAL, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.
099:35:09|O|LMP|Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.
099:35:40|O|CMP|Okay, it looks real quiet now; I'm ready to go right now.
099:36:00|O|CMP|Buzz, you copy?
099:36:10|O|CMP|Buzz, you copy?
099:36:13|O|LMP|Okay, Mike. Thanks.
099:36:17|O|CMP|Now, ... might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go anytime you're ready.
099:36:24|O|LMP|Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.
099:37:46|O|LMP|Okay, I'm starting my 5-minute rate - right now.
099:40:00|O|CMP|As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll; I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.
099:40:15|O|LMP|Roger.
099:40:17|O|CMP|Looks like a ...
099:40:31|O|CMP|Halfway through it, it looks like I have ... degrees in roll is about all.
099:40:39|O|LMP|Yes, those look like good ones right now.
099:41:22|O|LMP|Mike, what's your SEP time?
099:41:26|O|CMP|A few minutes.
099:41:49|O|CMP|GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.
099:42:01|O|CMP|I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess, ...
099:42:23|O|CMP|I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that DELTA-V be in the same position that they wanted.
099:42:33|O|LMP|Yes, I agree.
099:42:38|O|CMP|So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed Flight Plan; it might be wise to try to SEP about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of SEP that's precise whenever they want it.
099:43:06|O|CMP|I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.
099:43:21|O|LMP|Roger, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.
099:43:25|O|CMP|No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.
099:43:45|O|CDR|Just hanging on - and punching.
099:43:49|O|CMP|I didn't know ... radio. ... I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."
099:46:21|O|CMP|You cats take it easy on the lunar surface; if I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.
099:46:28|O|LMP|Okay, Mike.
099:46:37|O|CDR|I just pressurized the DPS. ... looks okay, Mike.
099:46:40|O|CMP|Roger that.
099:49:19|O|LMP|Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?
099:49:29|O|CMP|Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head; that's hard south; so's your radio beacon.
099:49:34|O|LMP|Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know -
099:49:48|O|CMP|Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS CAL.
099:49:54|O|LMP|...
099:50:19|O|CMP|How'd the AGS CAL work out?
099:50:23|O|LMP|Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers.
099:50:33|O|CMP|Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.
099:51:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 13
099:51:21|O|CMP|Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation-burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your Flight Plan for the undock attitude.
099:51:38|O|LMP|Okay.
099:53:12|O|CMP|When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
099:53:30|O|LMP|Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?
099:53:33|O|CMP|I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
099:53:38|O|LMP|Yes, we're through with that now.
099:53:41|O|CMP|Thank you. I'm maneuvering the ...
099:58:44|O|CMP|That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong ... for you.
099:58:49|O|LMP|Very good.
099:59:56|O|LMP|Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?
100:00:02|O|CMP|Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.
100:00:25|O|LMP|Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?
100:00:28|O|CMP|Yes, f:8 at 1/250th. And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.
100:03:53|O|CMP|How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy?
100:03:59|O|CDR|That'll be fine.
100:04:05|O|CMP|Okay.
100:04:11|O|CDR|What have you got for AOS, Mike?
100:04:14|O|CMP|I have 100 hours and 16 minutes.
100:04:20|O|CDR|Okay.
100:10:44|O|CMP|We got just about a minute to go; you guys all set?
100:10:48|O|CDR|Yes, I think we're about ready.
100:11:47|O|CDR|We're all set when you are, Mike.
100:11:51|O|CMP|15 seconds.
100:12:03|O|CMP|Okay, there you go. Beautiful!
100:12:06|O|CDR|...
100:12:10|O|LMP|Looks like a good SEP.
100:12:19|O|CMP|Looks good to me.
100:12:59|O|CDR|Okay. I've killed my rate, Mike, so you drift out to the distance you like and then stop your rate.
100:13:13|O|CDR|Starting my yaw.
100:13:30|O|CDR|There's sure a better visual in the simulator.
100:13:38|O|CMP|Okay. I picked up a little roll; I'm going to get rid of it.
100:14:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 14 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution. When next we hear from them the Lunar Module should be undocked from the Command and Service Module. We're presently about 25 minutes away from the separation burn which will be performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module to give the LM and the CSM a separation distance after descent orbit insertion maneuver of about 2 miles. We have some times on the upcoming events. The separation maneuver is scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds, the descent orbit insertion maneuver which will be performed on the backside of the Moon set for 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and the beginning of the powered descent at 102 hours, 33 minutes, 4 seconds. We're now 55 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the thirteenth revolution. During this revolution we will be doing the separation maneuver. We'll also be giving the crew on the Lunar Module a GO-NO/GO for the descent orbit insertion maneuver. We'll stand by now to reacquire the spacecraft. We have confirmation of acquisition of signal. We'll stand by for a call to the Crew.
100:14:22|O|CDR|Okay with you if I start my pitch, or you think you're not far enough away yet, Mike?
100:14:31|O|CMP|I'd prefer you stand by just a couple of seconds, Neil.
100:14:34|O|CDR|Okay. I'll wait for when you're ready – when you think you've got your rates killed perfectly.
100:14:39|O|CMP|Okay. I'm still holding ...
100:14:41|O|CDR|...
100:15:26|O|CMP|Okay, looks pretty good to me now.
100:15:30|O|CDR|Okay.
100:16:34|O|CMP|Just like in the simulator, you're drifting off to one side and down below a little bit.
100:16:39|O|CDR|Yes.
100:17:06|T|CC|Hello, Eagle. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
100:17:06|O|CMP|The gear are looking good; I've seen three of them.
100:17:11|O|CDR|The MESA is not down, right?
100:17:14|O|CMP|Say again.
100:17:15|O|CDR|The MESA's still up?
100:17:19|O|CMP|Yes,
100:17:20|O|CDR|Good.
100:17:49|O|CMP|Now, you're looking good.
100:17:51|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We see you on the steerable. Over.
100:17:59|O|LMP|Roger. Eagle's undocked. The Eagle has wings. Looking good.
100:18:01|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger. Eagle is undocked.
100:18:03|T|CC|Roger. How does it look, Neil?
100:18:04|T|CDR(EAGLE)|The Eagle has wings.
100:18:06|T|CC|Roger.
100:18:08|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Looking good.
100:18:09|T|CC|Roger, Neil. We got a - If you will give us P00 and DATA, we've got the loads for you.
100:18:18|O|CMP|Okay. You've got it, P00 and DATA.
100:18:20|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. You've got it. P00 and DATA.
100:18:24|T|CC|Roger. Let us know when you are ready to copy. We have a DOI PAD, and a PDI PAD. Over.
100:18:39|O|CDR|You check our tracking light, Mike?
100:18:41|T|CDR(EAGLE)|You check our tracking light, Mike?
100:18:44|O|CMP|It came on.
100:18:56|O|CMP|Camera's working beautifully.
100:19:00|O|CDR|Track off?
100:19:02|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Back off? Okay. I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
100:19:04|O|CMP|It's off.
100:19:05|O|CDR|I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
100:20:04|O|CDR|Does it look like you're going to be able to do this without firing any thrusters, Mike?
100:20:06|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Does it look like you are going to be able to do this without burning thrusters, Mike?
100:20:11|O|CMP|I'd have to fire laterally once or twice.
100:20:22|O|CMP|Very small.

100:29:04|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger. I see you.
100:29:08|O|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the fairly large numbers for range and range rate in - VERB 83? And did you - you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
100:29:10|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the very large numbers for range and range rate in VERB 83? And did you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
100:29:28|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. We gave you a LM state vector. We have not changed the CSM state vector, however. Over.
100:29:38|O|LMP|Okay. That explains the difference.
100:29:40|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. That explains it. Over.

100:30:53|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Would you have Columbia go to the high-gain, yaw 0, pitch minus 20. Over.
100:31:03|O|CDR|You want him to go to high-gain, YAW, zero or - say again the numbers.
100:31:05|T|CDR(EAGLE)|You want him to go to high-gain yaw 0? Say again the numbers.
100:31:13|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Yaw 0, pitch minus 20, high-gain angles. Over.
100:31:17|O|CDR|Okay. YAW, zero; PITCH, minus 20, on the high-gain. Columbia.
100:31:20|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. Yaw 0, pitch minus 20 on the high-gain.
100:31:23|T|CC|That's affirmative. We've lost all data with him.
100:31:24|O|CMP|Yes, I copy that, and I'll do it just as soon as I get to it.
100:31:25|T|CDR(EAGLE)|To Columbia?
100:31:27|O|CDR|Okay, he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.
100:31:29|T|CDR(EAGLE)|He says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.

100:31:45|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
100:32:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. How do you read?
100:32:38|O|CMP|Columbia, read you loud and clear. Houston, how me?
100:32:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I read you loud and clear, Houston. How me?
100:32:43|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Five by. On my Mark 7 minutes to ignition.
100:32:49|T|CC|MARK.
100:32:50|T|CC|Seven minutes.
100:32:55|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I agree. Everything's looking real good.
100:33:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You are looking good for separation. You are GO for separation, Columbia. Over.
100:33:55|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia understands.
100:34:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|We're really stabilized, Neil. I haven't burned a thruster in 5 minutes.
100:35:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I'll make a small trim maneuver.
100:36:21|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Mike, what's going to be your pitch angle at SEP?
100:36:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|007 degrees.
100:36:28|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
100:36:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Is that close enough for you or do you want it to a couple of decimal places?
100:36:46|T|CDR(EAGLE)|No. That's good.
100:37:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That separation was performed as scheduled. In the Command Module, a DELTA V of about 2.5 feet per second, which give a separation to the 2 vehicles of about 1100 feet at the beginning of the descent orbit insertion maneuver.
100:37:31|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I think you've got a fine looking flying machine there, Eagle, despite the fact you're upside down.
100:37:36|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Somebody's upside-down.
100:38:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay, Eagle. One minute until TIG. You guys take care.
100:38:56|T|CDR(EAGLE)|See you later.

101:07:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're coming up on 15 minutes now until loss of signal with the Lunar Module. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has - has advised his Flight Controllers to review all their data, take a good close look at the spacecraft, and in preparation for a GO-NO/GO decision on the descent orbit insertion.
101:07:10|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger.
101:14:09|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've lost data with Eagle. Will you please have him select aft OMNI? Over.
101:14:22|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston would like you to select aft OMNI.
101:14:37|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. I got it now. Houston, you reading Eagle now on aft OMNI?

101:16:30|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
101:17:07|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. It appeared to us when you were doing the P52, maneuvering the S band, the high-gain went into the stop. Verify that both S band breakers are in. Over.
101:17:23|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. I think I'd gone up to 90.0 before it went there. The one on this side is in and I'll check the other later.
101:17:29|T|CC|Okay. Thank you, Buzz.
101:17:53|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. You are GO for DOI. Over.

101:19:13|T|CC|Say again, Over.
101:19:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Just wanted to get a systems check from you sometime prior to LOS.
101:19:23|T|CC|Roger.

101:25:27|T|CC|Columbia/Eagle, Houston. Three minutes to LOS. Both looking good going over the hill.
101:25:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Roger.
101:25:38|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Eagle. Roger,
101:26:54|O|LMP|Burn time, 30 seconds.
101:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now, and the spacecraft Eagle has been given a GO for descent orbit insertion. That maneuver to occur in 7 minutes 40 seconds. Out of contact - out of radio contact, the DOI maneuver scheduled to come at 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and it will be a 76.4 foot per second burn. The burn duration 29.8 seconds, and the resulting orbit for the LM will be 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles. When next we acquire the Lunar Module, it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles on its way down to a low point of about 50,000 feet from where the powered descent to the lunar surface will begin. As the spacecraft went around the corner, all systems on both vehicles looked very good. Everything is GO here in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft for the descent orbit insertion to occur in 6 minutes, 38 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 101 hours 29 minutes.
101:28:44|O|LMP|Okay, state vector looks relatively good. ...
101:29:01|O|CDR|Mike, how do you read?
101:29:10|O|LMP|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
101:29:12|O|CMP|Very good. How do you read me?
101:29:13|O|LMP|Very good. If you are ready, give the MARK and we'll go to B DATA. Over.
101:29:19|O|CMP|Stand by 1. I'm ...
101:29:22|O|LMP|Are you ...?
101:29:27|O|CDR|63.
101:29:56|O|CMP|...; they look good.
101:29:59|O|LMP|Okay, let's switch to B DATA now.
101:30:02|O|CMP|Okay.
101:30:25|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
101:30:29|O|LMP|Go ahead.
101:30:31|O|CMP|Columbia's ...
101:35:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at lOl hours, 35 minutes. We're. now. less than one minute from the scheduled time for the descent orbit insertion maneuver performed by the Lunar Module on the backside of the Moon. Of course, we don't have radio contact with the spacecraft. In Mission Control here normally maneuvers of that sort would be monitored on plot boards in front, and we have the boards set up there for the powered descent. To occur about 1/2 rev from now over landing site 1. Flight Controllers standing around in little groups. Not much that we can do at this point until reacquiring spacecraft. We're now 20 minutes - or 20 seconds rather from ignition on the descent orbit insertion. It will be a 29.8 second burn of the 9800-pound thrust descent propulsion system. We should be burning at this time. The result of this maneuver will be to put the spacecraft into an orbit 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles, and it would remain in that orbit until powered descent.
101:35:00|P|PAO|We should have a cut off by this time. That should have completed descent orbit insertion maneuver. We would expect to reacquire the Command Module first. Command Module acquisition time is 102 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. That will be just about 2 minutes prior to the time that we will have reacquired the Lunar Module. The LM acquisition time is 102 hours, 16 minutes, 25 seconds. That is about 37 minutes, 20 seconds from now on the CSM at about a little less than 2 minutes longer than that for the LM. At 101 hours, 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
101:37:45|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. How's it going?
101:37:47|O|CDR|Mike, the burn's complete; it was on time - residuals are nulled, and AGS's free.
101:37:55|O|CMP|Beautiful.
101:42:58|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
101:42:59|O|LMP|Go ahead.
101:43:02|O|CMP|Roger. I'm ready to go back to VHF RANGING configuration. Be alright?
101:43:08|O|LMP|Roger. Let's go now to VHF RANGING.
101:43:11|O|CMP|Over and out.
101:43:20|O|CMP|Okay.
101:43:24|O|LMP|And you got VERB 76 in?
101:43:27|O|CMP|Yes, 76 is in ... locked up.
101:43:47|O|CMP|And we're ... 7.5 ...
101:43:52|O|LMP|Roger. That's just what we got, 7.6.

101:44:17|O|LMP|You don't have an 8-minute mark.
101:44:18|O|CDR|67 feet per second. Go ahead with the ...
101:44:23|O|LMP|Can't beat that. Okay, through with that?
101:44:26|O|CDR|Yes. I like it.
101:44:31|O|LMP|Hold on to the ... below.
101:44:35|O|CDR|Okay. And I'll pull the breakers - think we can ... roll.
101:44:51|O|LMP|Yes.
101:45:03|O|LMP|Got them both?
101:45:05|O|CDR|What?
101:45:06|O|LMP|Got them both?
101:45:07|O|CDR|Yes. ...
101:45:34|O|LMP|Okay, it ...
101:45:42|O|CDR|Going to load the PDI plus 12, right?
101:45:52|O|LMP|Right.
101:45:54|O|CDR|Okay. I'm going to start pitching down to 125.
101:46:15|O|LMP|No PDI plus 12.
101:46:34|O|CMP|I have you right down ... 65 feet per second.
101:46:38|O|CDR|Sounds good.
101:47:03|O|LMP|Okay, the camera is set. And ought to be ready to do the P52.
101:47:13|O|CDR|Yes.
101:47:15|O|LMP|Not going to be much of a drift check.
101:47:23|O|CDR|It - it torques them late enough to ensure that - ... the drift check.
101:47:32|O|LMP|Sure seems like we're going the wrong way.
101:47:42|O|LMP|How much do we got to go to pick it up?
101:47:46|O|CDR|Got to go - oh, half the moon to go, I guess.
101:48:05|O|CDR|Coming down already.
101:48:06|O|LMP|Okay. It's got us 152; it's 151; there's ..., okay? ...
101:48:44|O|LMP|There's 52.
101:48:54|O|CDR|Got 8 minutes ...
101:48:59|O|LMP|Now we can let us take - let it take us there.
101:49:03|O|CDR|No, wait; don't do that.
101:49:05|O|LMP|Why not?
101:49:06|O|CDR|I have to roll.
101:49:09|O|LMP|Yes, that's right.

101:54:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 101 hours, 54 minutes. We're now about 20 minutes, 45 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module on the 14th revolution. The time until the ignition for the power descent is 38 minutes, 55 seconds. Here in Mission Control, people still standing and waiting. I believe back in the viewing room, we probably have one of the largest assemblages of space officials that we've ever seen in one place. Included among the viewers are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Jim Elms, Director of the Electronic Research Center at Cambridge, Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of NASA's Lewis Research Center, Rocco Petrone, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center is there. From Marshall Space Center, we have Dr. Wernher von Braun, the Director, and his Deputy, Dr. Eberhard Rees. Also a large number of Astronauts including Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, Jim McDivitt, and John Glenn. We also see Dr. Kurt Debus, Director of the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Edgar Cortright, Director of the Langley Research Center. Dr. S. Draper, Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentations Laboratory is also in the viewing room. Here in the Control Room proper down on the floor a number of Astronauts including Pete Conrad, Fred Haise, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Sitting beside us in the back row of consoles here is Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. Further down on the line is General Sam Phillips, Director of the Apollo Program. Also Chris Kraft is here, Director of Flight Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center, and George Low of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. We also see in the back viewing room, Secretary of the Air Force, Seamans, and many others who I'm sure we can't see through the glass. We're now 18 minutes, 10 seconds until reacquisition of the spacecraft. Ignition for the power descent to the lunar surface is 36 minutes, 30 seconds away. At 101 hours, 57 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
101:54:09|O|CDR|312, it likes.
101:54:13|O|LMP|Well, we ought to proceed on that for a while.
101:54:18|O|CDR|Okay.
101:54:27|O|LMP|These clocks you can't move like you can some. Let me try and get that clock set for PDI. ... 33 ...

102:01:47|O|CDR|Okay. We'll ...
102:02:11|O|CDR|Cottonpicker just won't stay - try it!
102:02:16|O|LMP|Well, wait until we lose that descent stage, man.
102:02:19|O|CDR|We'd better take - a - piece of tape; hold that down.
102:02:25|O|LMP|How about if you get the bottom in the – get the bottom underneath this cover? That help?
102:02:34|O|CDR|Well, it - it's still not; I've had it in there real good couple of times.
102:02:42|O|LMP|Your - hoses were tearing hell out of my board.
102:02:47|O|CDR|Sorry.
102:02:50|O|LMP|You got INVERTER 1 circuit breaker in, right?
102:02:53|O|CDR|Checked in.
102:02:54|O|LMP|Okay. I'm going to check INVERTER 1. INVERTER 2 is good; and INVERTER 1 is good, and we're on INVERTER.
102:03:05|O|CDR|... look good.
102:03:16|O|LMP|Okay, get your AELD circuit breaker in and ABORT STAGE circuit breaker in.
102:03:19|O|CDR|AELD is in; ABORT STAGE is in.
102:03:24|O|LMP|Cycle the CWEA? No, we must have lost one.
102:03:28|O|CDR|Yes. That cottonpicker may be trouble.
102:03:35|O|LMP|Well, we'll have to tell them about that. I don't know when it - when it went out, because we didn't get any light that I saw, did you?
102:03:45|O|CDR|I think it's just a switch. I ... if it doesn't trigger a light -
102:03:50|O|LMP|Something - -
102:03:51|O|CDR|Oh, we're in PULSE, and we're not commanding any firing - -
102:03:55|O|LMP|I don't know; that could have come under DOI, but I doubt it.
102:04:02|O|CDR|I just think that's one of those sticky flags. ... got a good engine.
102:04:11|O|LMP|Alright, let's see.
102:04:12|O|CDR|...
102:04:18|O|LMP|ENGINE STOP button was reset?
102:04:24|O|CDR|ENGINE STOP button is START, but it is going to be now.
102:04:31|O|LMP|Alright. Window bars; THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
102:04:39|O|CDR|Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.

102:04:56|O|CDR|That's the wrong time, right?
102:04:57|O|LMP|No, no, no.
102:04:59|O|CDR|...? PDI?
102:05:00|O|LMP|It's - oh - about - probably maybe a second, right here, ... 32. Okay?
102:05:09|O|CDR|Yes, it's about a second off.
102:05:13|O|LMP|If it's fast, I'll stop it; if it isn't, why, forget it.
102:05:50|O|LMP|You want this one over there?
102:05:51|O|CDR|I need this out. Burn in 46 minutes.
102:05:57|O|LMP|You want this one?
102:06:00|O|CDR|Yes. I don't - think - it'll be helpful, but I'll stick it here and pull it out if I need it.
102:06:20|O|LMP|Let's see; we haven't got P20 going yet, have we?
102:06:23|O|CDR|No.
102:06:24|O|LMP|Let's do that. Let's get the RENDEZVOUS RADAR circuit breaker in.
102:06:27|O|CDR|Okay.
102:06:34|O|LMP|IN. Might look at the DPS.
102:06:51|O|CDR|What do you hear?
102:07:00|O|LMP|... glycol pumps.
102:07:03|O|CDR|Alright.
102:07:10|O|CDR|Look at that. Oh, that must have been - ...
102:07:20|O|LMP|Okay, ascent - tank pressure - temperature's up, changed to - I don't know.
102:07:28|O|CDR|DPS's good -
102:07:30|O|LMP|Look at all that RCS we got.
102:07:35|O|CDR|That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?
102:07:38|O|LMP|Yes.
102:07:51|O|CDR|Got your camera rigged?
102:07:54|O|LMP|The other circuit breaker? Camera's all set to go. I hope the others just don't fall out. Got them both in?
102:08:01|O|CDR|Yes.
102:08:17|O|LMP|Well, let's hope he's in mode 2.
102:08:33|O|LMP|Okay, I'm going to get the ASCENT BATS, ON. BATTERY 5, ON; looks good. BATTERY 6, ON; that's good.
102:09:08|O|CDR|Yes, we've lost it.
102:09:14|O|LMP|Well, did it go to mode 2? That's where I want it to go.
102:09:22|O|CDR|No - I can't tell.
102:09:26|O|LMP|Yes, it's going to mode 2. Hasn't it?
102:09:33|O|CDR|Yes.
102:09:34|O|LMP|Yes. There we are. Beautiful.
102:09:38|O|CDR|Go to AUTO TRACK?
102:09:39|O|LMP|No, not yet - wait until the light goes out. Did that thing want to - Hey, I didn't know that could do that. You don't hear that, huh? (Laughter)
102:10:01|O|LMP|Hear that, too, huh?
102:10:06|O|CDR|Sounds like wind whipping around the trees.
102:10:16|O|LMP|Okay, AUTO TRACK.
102:10:32|O|LMP|Okay, we ready to go to P63?
102:10:36|O|CDR|Yes.
102:11:07|O|LMP|Okay, get a - get a - Need to compare a TIG time. 09:50. That's right.
102:11:25|O|CDR|See that Big Dipper there?
102:11:27|O|LMP|That's a big out of plane, but I don't know which way it is.
102:11:33|O|CDR|I believe minus - but they were expecting it.
102:11:36|O|LMP|Okay, four -
102:11:38|O|CDR|That's within 7 ... seconds. Okay?
102:11:53|O|LMP|Okay. These should not be in AUTO, right?
102:11:57|O|CDR|Yes. Remember that one.
102:12:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 102 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We're now 2 minutes 53 seconds from reacquiring the spacecraft, 21 minutes 23 seconds from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface. It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control. A few moments ago Flight Director Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and closed with a remark "Good luck to all of you". Here on the front of our display boards we have a number of big plot boards which will be used to keep track of the burn progress. Along the more important of those is one which will show the performance on onboard guidance systems, both the primary and the back up guidance system and compare the guidance systems with the Manned Space Flight Network tracking. These displays, by the time this is all over, will look a great deal like a combination Christmas tree and Fourth of July. We're now 1 minute 39 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module, Columbia. Acquisition of the Lunar Module will come a little less than 2 minutes after that. At the time we acquire the LM it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles descending toward the 50,000 foot pericynthion from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated. If for any reason the crew does not like the way things look as they are coming across the pericynthion, simply by not initiating the maneuver they will remain in a safe orbit of 60 miles by 50,000 feet, and if they desired they would be able to attempt the powered descent on the following revolution at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 104 hours 26 minutes. We're now coming up on 30 seconds to acquisition of the Command Module and we'll stand by for that event.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Now work controller says we have acquisition of signal from the Command Module.
102:12:00|P|PAO|We have acquisition of signal from the LM.
102:12:00|P|PAO|We're attempting to restore antenna lock through the big 210 foot dish at Goldstone. We'll stand by.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Guidance says we're GO.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Now 12 minutes, 54 seconds to ignition. Gene Kranz just replied his Flight Controllers were off to a good start. Play it cool.
102:12:00|P|PAO|12 minutes now until ignition for powered descent. Everything still looking very good at this point.
102:12:00|P|PAO|We presently show the LM at an altitude of 12.9 nautical miles and descending.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Aldrin is referring to the LM steerable antenna. That comment about the oscillations.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Eagle is now at 10.7 nautical miles, 7 minutes 37 seconds from ignition.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Coming up on 5 minutes to ignition. Gene Kranz getting a GO/NO GO for. descent.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Buzz Aldrin reading off the checklist there to Neil Armstrong.
102:12:00|P|PAO|Coming up on 1 minute to ignition.
102:12:13|O|LMP|180, 287, 0. Here goes.
102:12:46|O|CMP|Give me - -
102:12:47|O|CDR|You'll get them before we will.
102:12:50|O|CMP|Ready to give them a status report? DOI?
102:12:54|O|LMP|Well, I hope it's on the right page.
102:13:24|O|LMP|Okay, I'm going to get DESCENT QUANTITY, ON, ... ON.
102:14:19|O|CDR|Okay, you want to give it - Okay, we've lost it. In AUTO now.
102:14:42|O|LMP|... RANGE RATE.
102:14:59|O|CDR|How about that?
102:15:02|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We're standing by. Over.
102:15:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
102:15:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
102:15:43|T|CC|Roger. Five by, Mike. How did it go? Over.
102:15:49|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Listen, babe. Everything's going just swimmingly, Beautiful.
102:15:52|T|CC|Great. We're standing by for Eagle.
102:15:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay, He's coming along.
102:16:00|T|CC|We copy. Out.
102:16:09|T|CC|And, Columbia, Houston. We expect to lose your high-gain sometime during the powered descent. Over.
102:16:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Roger. You don't much care do you?
102:16:22|T|CC|No, sir.
102:17:27|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, Eagle. How do you read?
102:17:29|T|CC|Five by, Eagle. We're standing by for your burn report. Over.
102:17:36|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. The burn was on time. The residuals before nulling: minus 0.1, minus 0.4, minus 0.1, X and Z nulled to zero ... nulling ...
102:18:25|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've lost all data with Eagle. Please have him reacquire on the high-gain, Over.
102:18:37|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston would like you to reacquire on the high-gain. They've lost your data. Over.
102:18:50|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, did you copy Columbia?
102:18:54|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Did you call?
102:19:05|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Eagle, Houston - Houston, Eagle. How do you read now?
102:19:08|T|CC|Roger. Five by, Neil. We copied up to the AGS residuals. Would you please repeat the AGS residuals in the trim - correction - the Sun check? Over.
102:19:19|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. AGS residuals: minus 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 0.7. And we used the PGNS NOUN 86 for DELTA-VZ which was 9.5, versus yours which was 9.1, and I believe that may explain the difference. Apogee 57.2, perilune 9.1, Sun check to three marks, NOUN 20, minus NOUN 22, plus 0.19, plus 0.16, plus 0.11. Over.
102:19:54|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Looks great.
102:22:37|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've lost Eagle again. Have him try the high-gain. Over.
102:22:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston lost you again. They're requesting another try at the high-gain.
102:23:57|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We have you now. Do you read? Over.
102:24:02|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Loud and clear.
102:24:04|T|CC|Roger. We see your VERB 47.
102:24:12|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Yes. I don't know what the problem was there. It just started oscillating around in yaw. According to the needle, we're picking up a little oscillation right now, as a matter of fact.
102:24:23|T|CC|Roger. We'll work on it.
102:24:38|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Horizon checklist right on time.
102:24:41|T|CC|Roger.
102:24:45|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Did you copy the star - I mean the Sun check, Charlie?
102:24:48|T|CC|That's affirmative. We did, Buzz. Out.
102:25:35|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. The AGS initialization looked good to us. Over.
102:25:43|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger.
102:26:28|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Our radar checks indicate 50,000 foot perilune. Our visual altitude checks steadying out at about 53,000.
102:26:37|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
102:26:55|T|LMP(EAGLE)|And, Houston, we got a 500 alarm early in the program. Went to DESCENT 1, proceeded on it, and we're back at AUTO again. Over.
102:27:06|T|CC|Roger. We saw that, Buzz. Thank you much. Out.
102:27:09|T|LMP(EAGLE)|All right. I say again - Okay. That wasn't an alarm; that was a code. Okay.
102:27:14|T|CC|Roger. We saw that.
102:27:22|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We recommend you yaw 10 right. It will help us on the high-gain signal strength. Over.
102:28:08|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. If you read, you're GO for powered descent. Over.
102:28:18|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. They just gave you a GO for powered descent.
102:28:22|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've lost them on the high-gain again. Would you please - We recommend they yaw right 10 degrees and reacquire.
102:28:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. You're GO for PDI and they recommend you yaw right 10 degrees and try the high-gain again.
102:28:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, you read Columbia?
102:28:48|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. We read you.
102:28:49|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
102:28:51|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We read you now. You're GO for PDI. Over.
102:28:57|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Understand. AELD control circuit breakers. DECA GIMBAL AC - closed?
102:29:07|T|CDR(EAGLE)|What?

102:47:08|T|LMP(TRANQ)|...
102:47:09|T|CC|- - T1. Over. Eagle, you are STAY for T1.
102:47:12|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand, STAY for T1.
102:47:15|T|CC|Roger. And we see you venting the 0X.
102:47:20|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
102:47:37|T|LMP(TRANQ)|... circuit breaker.
102:48:00|P|PAO|The next major stay, no stay will be for a T2 event, that is at 21 minutes 26 seconds after initiation for power descent.
102:48:00|P|PAO|We have an unofficial time for that touchdown of a 102 hours 45 minutes 42 seconds and we will update that.
102:48:00|P|PAO|We are now less than 4 minutes from our next stay, no stay. The stay will be for 1 complete revolution of the Command Module.
102:48:00|P|PAO|One of the first things that Armstrong and Aldrin will do after getting their next stay, no stay will be to remove their helmet and gloves.
102:48:00|P|PAO|That stay for another 2 minutes plus. The next stay no stay will be for 1 revolution.
102:48:10|T|LMP(TRANQ)|... copy NOUN 60, NOUN 43. Over.
102:48:12|O|CMP|Houston, how do you reed Columbia on the high-gain?
102:48:13|T|CC|Roger. We have it.
102:48:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, how do you read Columbia on the high-gain?
102:48:17|T|CC|Roger - -
102:48:18|T|LMP(TRANQ)|...
102:48:19|T|CC|- - We read you five by, Columbia. He has landed, Tranquility Base. Eagle is at Tranquility. Over.
102:48:26|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Yes. I heard the whole thing.
102:48:27|T|CC|... good show.
102:48:31|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Fantastic.
102:48:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Engine STOP RESET.
102:48:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia went UPTELEMETRY COMMAND, RESET, to reacquire on the high-gain.
102:49:02|T|CC|Copy. Out.
102:49:39|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. You loaded R2 wrong. We want 10254.
102:49:50|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
102:50:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And do you want V horizontal 5515.2?
102:50:32|T|CC|That's affirmative.
102:50:59|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Like - AGS to PGNS align.
102:51:04|T|CC|Say again?
102:51:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Like an AGS to PNGS align. Over.
102:51:11|T|CC|Roger. We're standing by for it.
102:51:41|T|LMP(TRANQ)|... quantity ...
102:51:45|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. You are STAY for T2. Over.
102:51:50|T|CC|Correction, you're - -
102:51:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. STAY for T2. We thank you.
102:51:54|T|CC|Roger, sir.
102:53:00|P|PAO|steady for another 2 minutes plus, the next stay no stay, will be for 1 revolution. We don't expect much in the way of a visual description of the landing area from the crew until after we get through these critical stay, no stay periods and have gotten the status to remain on the lunar surface for at least 1 Command and Service Module revolution. All spacecraft systems continue to look good to us here on the ground.
102:53:37|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We recommend you exit P12. Over.
102:55:16|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Hey, Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase. The AUTO targeting was taking us right into a football field size - football field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about ... one or two crater diameters around it, and it required a ... in P66 and flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.
102:55:49|T|CC|Roger. We copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.
102:56:02|T|LMP(TRANQ)|We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.
102:56:47|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.
102:57:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
102:57:02|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. This one sixth g is just like the airplane.
102:57:04|T|CC|Roger. Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world. Over.
102:57:15|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Well, there are two of them up here.
102:57:17|T|CC|Roger. That was a beautiful job, you guys.
102:57:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|And don't forget one in the Command Module.
102:57:22|T|CC|Roger.
102:57:48|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We have you pitched up about 4 1/2 degrees. Over.
102:57:55|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That's confirmed by our local observation.
102:58:00|T|CC|Roger.
102:58:00|P|PAO|That last remark from Mike Collins at an altitude of 60 miles. The comments on the landing on the manual take-over came from Neil Armstrong. Buzz Aldrin followed that with a description of the lunar surface and the rocks and boulders that they are able to see out the window of the LM.
102:58:00|P|PAO|That request from Neil Armstrong.
102:58:00|P|PAO|Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the -
102:58:00|P|PAO|We have just gotten a report from the TEL COM here in Mission Control that the LM systems looked good after that landing. We're about 26 minutes now from loss of signal from the Command Module.
102:58:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|And thanks for putting me on relay, Houston. I was missing all the action.
102:58:16|T|CC|Roger. We'll enable MSFN relay.
102:58:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I just got it, I think.
102:58:28|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Say something. They ought to be able to hear you. Over.
102:58:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Tranquility Base. It sure sounded great from up here. You guys did a fantastic job.
102:58:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Thank you. Just keep that orbiting base ready for us up there now.
102:58:55|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Will do.
102:59:19|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. LOS 103 27, AOS 104 13. Over.
102:59:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
103:00:42|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. All your consumables are solid. You're looking good in every respect. We copy the DPS are venting. Everything is copasetic. Over.
103:00:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Thank you, Houston.
103:02:03|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.
103:02:41|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.
103:03:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong reporting there. No difficulty adapting to the one-sixth gravity of the Moon.
103:03:32|T|CDR(TRANQ)|You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.
103:03:47|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.
103:03:55|T|CDR(TRANQ)|The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5  to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1  and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.
103:04:54|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We copy Over.
103:05:01|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Sounds like it looks a lot better than it did yesterday - -
103:05:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|...
103:05:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|- - at that very low Sun angle. It looked rough as a cob then.
103:05:11|T|CDR(TRANQ)|It really was rough, Mike. Over the targeted landing area, it was extremely rough, cratered, and large numbers of rocks that were probably some, many larger than 5 or 10 feet in size.
103:05:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|When in doubt, land long.
103:05:38|T|CDR(TRANQ)|So we did.
103:05:57|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. After you get through this P57, we'd like an E memory dump. Over.
103:06:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. After this first P57, you want an E memory dump.
103:06:11|T|CC|That's affirmative.
103:06:16|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We have a P22 update for you, if you're ready to copy. Over.
103:06:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|At your service, sir.
103:06:29|T|CC|Roger, Mike. T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28. And that is 4 miles south. This is based on a targeted landing site. Over.
103:06:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Roger. Understand based on a targeted landing site; T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south.
103:07:10|T|CC|Roger.
103:07:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Just a little bit long, is that all we know?
103:07:19|T|CC|Apparently that's about all we can tell. Over.
103:07:24|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you.
103:08:06|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston - -
103:08:07|T|CDR(TRANQ)|And, Houston, our mission timer is now reading 902 34 47 and static.
103:08:17|T|CC|Roger. Copy your mission timer's now static. It - Say again the time?
103:08:24|T|CDR(TRANQ)|902 34 47.
103:08:35|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Tranquility. That gravity align looked good to us. We see you recycling.
103:08:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.
103:09:08|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Stand by.
103:10:15|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.
103:10:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. I concur with that.
103:10:26|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.
103:10:45|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902 04 40. When I release it now, I get 902 04 49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.
103:11:08|T|CC|Roger.
103:11:12|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I cycled the circuit breaker and got all nines. And we'll not now reset from all nines.
103:11:22|T|CC|Roger.
103:11:37|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We'll research this problem and be back with you momentarily on the mission event time - correction, the mission timer.
103:11:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
103:12:44|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.
103:14:02|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We see the NOUN 93, VERB 34.
103:14:10|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. I assume you wanted it. Roger.
103:14:32|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Please vent fuel and OX again. Over. It's building back up.
103:14:42|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. OX going now.
103:14:52|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. You can open both fuel and OX vent now. Over.
103:14:59|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
103:15:01|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility standing by for GO on a AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.
103:15:09|T|CC|Stand by.
103:15:17|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. You are GO for the AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.
103:15:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
103:15:44|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Please vent the fuel. It's increasing rapidly. Over.
103:16:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We show 30 psi in the fuel and 30 in the oxidizer.
103:16:05|T|CC|Roger. We're reading somewhat different than that. Stand by.
103:16:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|The fuel temperature is reading 64 in the descent, and the oxidizer - that's descent 2 - and the oxidizer is off scale low. Descent 1 is showing 61 in the fuel and 65 in the oxidizer.
103:16:41|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. Tranquility, Houston. Please take the fuel vent switch and hold it open. Over.
103:17:01|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. We're holding it open. Indicating about 24 psi onboard.
103:17:09|T|CC|Roger.
103:17:34|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Now indicating 20 psi in the fuel side.
103:17:37|T|CC|Roger.
103:17:38|T|CDR(TRANQ)|And 22 in the OX.
103:17:41|T|CC|Roger.
103:18:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Now indicating 15 psi in both tanks.
103:18:51|T|CC|Roger.
103:19:17|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. If you haven't done so, you can release the fuel vent switch now. Over.
103:19:25|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
103:20:52|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We have indication that we've frozen up the descent fuel helium heat exchanger, and there's some fuel trapped in the line between there and the valvs; and the pressure we're looking at is increasing there. Over.
103:21:10|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand.
103:22:00|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. If you have not done so, please close both fuel and OX vents now. Over.
103:22:17|T|CDR(TRANQ)|They're closed.
103:22:18|T|CC|Thank you, sir.
103:22:30|T|CDR(TRANQ)|From the surface, we could not see any stars out the window; but out my overhead hatch, I'm looking at the Earth. It's big and bright and beautiful. Buzz is going to give a try at seeing some stars through the optics.
103:22:54|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We understand. Must be a beautiful sight. Over.
103:23:00|P|PAO|We would like to point out that the fuel pressure problem that had been called to the attention of the crew, is in the descent system and it is probably the downstream of the tanks where a small amount of fluid has been trapped in a line and we don't expect it to cause any problem. The line should be able to take far more pressure than the fluid would exert. In the event that there was an over-pressurization, we would expect that the line would spring a small leak, the pressure would drop rapidly. Again, we point out that we do not see this as a significant problem.
103:23:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal now from the Command Module and of course, we'll maintain constant communications with the Lunar Module on the lunar surface. We have some heart rates for Nell Armstrong during that power descent to the lunar surface. At the time the burn was initiated, Armstrong's heart rate was 110. At touchdown on the lunar surface, he had a heart rate of 156 beats her minute, and the Flight Surgeon reports that his heart rate is now in the 90's. We do not have biomedical on Buzz Aldrin.
103:23:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 32 minutes. We have an update on that touchdown time on the lunar surface. This still is not the final, official time which we will get from readout of data, but the refined time is 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds, which would have been 12 minutes 36 seconds after initiating the powered descent. That was 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds for touchdown and a total time of powered descent 12 minutes 36 seconds, and we would expect then those numbers to change perhaps a little when we get final data readouts.
103:24:52|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Two minutes to LOS. You're looking great going over the hill. Over.
103:25:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you. Glad to hear the system's looking good. You have a suggested attitude for me? This one here seems all right.
103:25:15|T|CC|Stand by.
103:25:21|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Let me know when it's lunch time, will you?
103:25:24|T|CC|Say again.
103:25:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Oh, disregard.
103:25:31|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You got a good attitude right there.
103:25:37|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you.
103:33:16|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. If you want me to, I can give you a hack on the mission time, every 30 minutes. Over.
103:34:07|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. I'm counting down to T3 time. If you'd like to give me a hack, we can set up an event timer. Over.
103:34:22|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. How about counting up?
103:34:23|T|CC|Roger. You want it counting up? Stand by.
103:35:30|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. On my Mark, 62 30.
103:35:34|T|CC|MARK.
103:35:35|T|CC|62 30 from - pas
103:35:46|T|LMP(TRANQ)|What we're looking for, Charlie, is the time counting up to T2 that'll be equal to 60 minutes - or T3, be equal to 60 minutes on T3.
103:35:56|T|CC|Roger. We'll have it for you.
103:36:28|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Reset the event timer to zero and on my Mark at 103 39 41. We'll give you a hack, and it'll be 1 hour. Over.
103:36:44|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
103:36:45|T|CC|And we've got about - almost 3 minutes to go, Neil. Over.
103:36:51|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
103:39:16|T|CC|Tranquility Base, stand by on the event timer.
103:39:25|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark start your event timer.
103:39:36|T|CC|5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
103:39:41|T|CC|MARK.
103:39:46|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. We got it; thank you.
103:39:47|T|CC|Roger, Neil.
103:44:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 44 minutes. There will be a brief statement from Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, in the building 1 auditorium at 4:30. We also have some updated information on the landing point. It appears that the spacecraft, Eagle, touched down at 799 degrees north, or just about on the lunar equator. And 23.46 degrees longitude, which would have put it about 4 miles from the targeted landing point downrange. We're now 54 minutes - rather 27 minutes from reacquisition of the Command Module, and of course, we're in constant contact with the Lunar Module on the surface. At this point, all LM systems seem to look very good.
103:47:19|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We see the star angle difference. Looks good.
103:47:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. That last star was Navi, and it wasn't too well distinguishable. I can see where that error could come in. I think for the gravity alignment with one star, Rigel will be quite good.
103:47:42|T|CC|Roger. Stand by on the NOUN 93.
103:48:04|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like you to torque that. Over.
103:49:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 15
103:49:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, this is Tranquility. Do you want us to accept this position? Over.
103:49:24|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We're looking at it. Stand by. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker on panel 11 for the mission timer. Over.
103:49:35|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I've already done that, Charlie.
103:49:37|T|CC|Okay.
103:50:20|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to reject that RLS. Over.
103:50:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
103:50:32|T|CC|And, Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like you to call - after this, call P00, and give us a E memory dump.
103:51:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Here comes the E memory dump.
103:51:28|T|CC|Roger.
103:51:41|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And we got 1106.
103:51:43|T|CC|Roger.
103:52:09|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Did I copy PROGRAM ALARM 1106 from you? Over.
103:52:16|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. That' s affirmative.
103:52:18|T|CC|Okay. Stand by.
103:52:19|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Could that, by any chance, be due to the fact that I flashed the updata link switch to DATA while that was going on? Over.
103:52:29|T|CC|Stand by.
103:52:38|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. The SPAN guys think that's conceivable. Stand by. I think we want another VERB 74.
103:52:51|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Standing by.
103:53:02|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like another VERB 74. Over.
103:53:13|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Here it comes.
103:53:54|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark it will be GET 103 53.
103:54:00|T|CC|MARK.
103:54:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 57 minutes. We will be taking the release line down briefly for a statement from Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator. We will be recording further conversations with the spacecraft and will played those back following the statement. This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 58 minutes.
103:54:01|T|CC|103 53 - correction, 54.
103:54:09|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.

104:05:26|T|CC|Stand by, and we'll check.
104:05:42|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Do you still hear it now? Over.
104:05:59|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I still hear it. it sounds like somebody banging chairs around in the back room.
104:06:05|T|CC|Roger. That's a VOGAA that you hear for the CSM to keep the noise down on the loop. Maybe we got a MSFN relay or something. Stand by.
104:06:17|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay.
104:06:43|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We got the MSFN relay in. You're hearing the VOGAA, which is a noise suppression device. We'll try to take it out. Over.
104:06:55|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right. Thank you.
104:08:00|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. It ought to be a little quieter up there now. We disabled the MSFN relay.

104:23:53|T|CC|Roger.
104:24:51|T|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. We will not come up on the MSFN relay. We'd like you to come on panel 9, turn on your VHF to TR. Over.
104:25:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. I'm on panel 9. Ready to receive. You want me to transmit for some reason with it?
104:25:14|T|CC|Say again, Mike. You're about two by.
104:25:21|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Panel 9 is configured VHF, RECEIVE. You want me to transmit with the VHF for some reason? Why do you want me in TR?
104:25:31|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We don't want you to transmit, Mike. We just want you in that position in case you want to talk to Tranquility. Break. Tranquility, Houston. Say again. Over.
104:25:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I have a fairly good sized difference between battery volts on 5 and 6; 6 is reading 33.5 and 5 is reading 36.5. Is that what you expect? Over.
104:26:03|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
104:26:09|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. They are both coming up in voltage. No problem. We're still GO. Over.
104:26:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
104:31:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 104 hours, 31 minutes now into this historic mission, Apollo 11. During the news conference with NASA Administrator Dr. Thomas Paine, we had conversation with both Eagle and Columbia and we'll play that tape for you now.
104:32:38|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Could you please give us a readout now of all of your descent tank pressures? Over.
104:32:56|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay, Houston. On descent 1, fuel and oxidizer are reading 10 psi; and descent 2, fuel is reading 10 psi, oxidizer 11 psi.
104:32:56|O|LMP|Okay, Houston. On DESCENT 1, the fuel and oxidizer are reading 10 psi; on DESCENT 2, fuel is reading 10 psi; oxidizer, 11 psi.
104:33:09|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. Thank you much. Out.
104:34:02|O|CDR|Okay, going back to OFF.
104:34:40|O|CDR|... is OPEN. Yes, ...
104:34:46|O|LMP|Alright, we need the -
104:34:52|O|LMP|Houston, Tranquility Base is ready to go through the powerdown and terminate the simulated countdown.
104:34:55|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base is ready to go through the powerdown and terminate the simulated countdown.
104:35:03|T|CC|Roger. Standby.
104:35:08|O|CDR|Hope he is, too.
104:35:10|O|LMP|OPEN.
104:35:13|O|CDR|Okay, the operations HEATER circuit breaker is OPEN.
104:35:21|O|LMP|Roger. It's in progress. Anytime, take your helmet off.
104:35:23|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. You can start your powerdown now. Over.
104:35:31|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. It's in progress.
104:35:37|T|CC|And, Tranquility Base, the White Team is going off now and letting the Maroon Team take over. We appreciate the great show. It was a beautiful Job, you guys.
104:35:45|O|LMP|Roger. Couldn't have had better treatment from all of you back there.
104:35:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Couldn't of had better agreement from all of you back there.
104:39:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility.
104:39:09|T|CC|Go, Tranquility. Over.
104:39:14|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Our recommendation at this point is planning an EVA with your concurrence starting about eight o'clock this evening, Houston time. That is about 3 hours from now.
104:39:31|T|CC|Stand by.
104:39:35|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Well, we will give you some time to think about that.
104:39:40|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We thought about it; we will support it. You're GO at that time. Over.
104:39:48|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
104:39:56|T|CC|You guys are getting prime time TV there.
104:40:08|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Hope that little TV set works, but we'll see.
104:40:13|T|CC|Roger.
104:40:33|T|CC|Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Was your eight o'clock Houston time a reference to opening the hatch or starting the PREP for EVA at that time? Over.
104:40:46|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That would be hatch opening.
104:40:48|T|CC|That's what we thought. Thank you much.
104:40:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That might be a little later than that, but in other words, start the PREP in about an hour or so.
104:40:55|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?
104:40:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?
104:41:00|T|CC|Stand by, Columbia.
104:41:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 104 hours 44 minutes. You heard that last exchange and there is a very strong indication we might have an early EVA with the hatch opened perhaps at 8:00 Houston time. One other item of significance that this the pressure rise in - depth descent propellant line downstage of the tanks has relieved all aspects of the mission, looking very good at this time. At 104 hours 45 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
104:41:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours now into the flight of Apollo 11. We expect a - our - our capsule communicator Owen Garriott to pass along data to spacecraft Columbia, momentarily. We're standing by for that. Meanwhile, I think we should discuss a little further the projected EVA. Our current plan is to have crew members above the Eagle to eat and relax for a little while prior to starting EVA preps. We won't know with certainty or have a reasonable time hack until about an hour before the scheduled event. Right it looks like it could occur at 8:00 Houston time. We have conversation going now with the spacecraft. We'll pick that up.
104:41:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We will shutdown the line at this time and turn to the news conference.
104:41:01|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. That's fine. We are ready to support you any time, Neil. Over.
104:41:02|O|CMP|Roger.
104:41:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger.
104:41:07|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
104:41:10|T|CC|Break. Columbia, we see the NOUN 49. Stand by.
104:41:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We got the data. We would like a VERB 34. Over.
104:41:44|O|CMP|Yes, stand by 1, Charlie, for the next ...
104:41:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Stand by one, Charlie, for the next one.
104:41:50|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Did - How did Tranquility look to you down there? Over.
104:41:56|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see him. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.
104:41:56|O|CMP|Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see them. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.
104:42:08|T|CC|Roger.
104:42:12|O|CMP|It looks like a nice area, though.
104:42:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|It looks like a nice area, though.
104:42:29|T|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. I understand you could not see Tranquility. What were you marking on? Over.
104:42:46|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. I say again: I did not see them. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked out a tiny crater in that area and marked on it, so that I'll be able to have repeatable data, but I was still unable to see them.
104:42:48|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. I say again, I could not see him. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked a tiny crater in that area and marked on it so I will be able to have repeatable data, but I was unable to see him.
104:43:05|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
104:46:11|T|CC|H ello, Tranquility Base. Houston. On our DPS venting and that fuel problem, our heat exchanger is cleared up. It appears that the ice is melted, and we are in good shape now. Out.
104:49:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston. Tranquility is going to put the track modes in P00 now.
104:59:27|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
104:59:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Go.
104:59:35|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We noticed you are maneuvering very close to gimbal lock. I suggest you move back away. Over.
104:59:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes. I am going around it, doing this CMC AUTO maneuvers to the PAD values of roll 270, pitch 101, yaw 45.
104:59:52|T|CC|Roger, Columbia.
105:00:30|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas.
105:00:40|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You were unreadable. Say again please.
105:00:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Disregard.
105:01:21|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Several items for you. Over.
105:01:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
105:01:30|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. First of all, we'd like a wastewater dump to 10 percent on the backside. Secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new REFSMMAT. Third item, I would like all of your CRYO heaters to AUTO, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery BRAVO; it will last about 7 hours. If you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that BATT charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the BATT charge on BATT Bravo. And a final item, for your SM RCS configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the DAP is 11111; DAP register 2, 01100. And your AUTO RCS select switches, quad Alfa, pitch jets on only, quad Bravo all on, quad Charlie and quad Delta all off. Over.
105:02:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Dump wastewater to 10 percent on the backside. Use prior REFSMMAT, CRYO heaters on to AUTO, battery B charge until I go to sleep. DAP is 11111, 01100. Select quads A pitch only on, C and D all up. Over.
105:03:22|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger.
105:04:25|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We will have a state vector update for you a little later. We are not prepared with it right now; and on another subject, from Tranquility Base, they are prepared to begin their EVA early. They expect to begin DEPRESS operations in about 3 hours at 108, approximately 108 GET. Over.
105:04:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Sounds good to me. Tell them to eat some lunch before they go.
105:06:07|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We'd like your PRD readouts when possible, and we've checked over your EM dump. It all looks okay.
105:06:48|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Over. 
105:06:54|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
105:06:56|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We'd like your PRD readout, and we have double checked your EM dump. It all looks okay. Over.
105:07:26|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand our E memory dump was good. CDR's dosimeter is 11014.
105:07:37|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And LMP is 09011.
105:07:44|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. Break. Columbia, we would like for you to REACQ with your high-gain; attempt a manual lock on. Over.
105:08:01|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|In work.
105:08:11|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility here. The LMP's readout may possibly be 09017. Over.
105:08:21|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger. 09017 is an update on your readout.
105:08:31|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia's in high-gain.
105:08:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I'll let you know for sure when it goes to either 12 or 18.
105:08:41|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger. The medics report your latter reading, 17, appears to be the correct one. Over.
105:08:54|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
105:09:11|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia's in the high-gain.
105:09:13|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. You're sounding much better now.
105:09:57|T|CC|Columbla, Houston. Request P00 in ACCEPT, and we'll uplink another state vector. Over.
105:10:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Going P00 in ACCEPT.
105:12:02|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Suggest you put BATT A on your BATT relay bus. Over.
105:12:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
105:12:46|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We're through with your computer. You can go to BLOCK.
105:12:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. BLOCK.
105:14:43|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
105:14:53|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston. Tranquility Base.
105:14:55|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We've reviewed the checklist, and about the only change in order to advance the EVA that we've found is that you'll want to delay your lithium hydroxide change until after the EVA rather than before. Over.
105:15:19|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. We'd just as soon make a change and jettison the old one. Over.
105:16:21|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We would like to delay that LOIO - LiOH change until after the EVA. There is a possibility you could jettison the canister when you jettison your PLSS. Over.
105:16:39|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right. We'll plan it that way. Over.
105:16:42|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility.
105:17:52|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
105:17:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.
105:17:59|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We show your EVAP OUT temperature running low. Request you go to manual temperature control and bring it up. You can check the procedures in ECS MAL 17. Over.
105:18:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Houston.
105:19:49|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. I have a P22 update for you.

105:25:31|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Go ahead.
105:25:38|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way. Over.
105:26:08|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility Base.
105:30:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 30 minutes on to the mission, Apollo 11. The spacecraft Columbia is now out of range with Mission Control Center, Houston, passing over the far side of the Moon. As it passed out of sight, we read an apolune of 63 nautical miles; a perilune of 56 nautical miles; a velocity of 5367 feet per second. We had conversation both with Tranquility base and Columbia during this span of time. Also, as will come up in that course of conversation. Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin delivers a message to people everywhere listening. We'll play those tapes for you now.
105:35:03|T|LMP(TRANQ)|That's about ready to fall off.
105:35:07|T|CDR(TRANQ)|As a matter of fact, it just doesn't look like it sunk in at all.
105:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 42 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. You have heard that statement in our tapes transmission from Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin. Our projected time for extravehicular activity, at this point, is still very preliminary. I repeat, it could come as soon as 8:00 p.m. Houston time. We won't know for sure about the time, with reasonable certainty until about an hour before the event. Meanwhile, as we'll soon be progressing toward man's first step on the lunar surface, we have an interesting phenomena here in the mission Control Center, Houston. Something we've never seen before. Our visual of the Lunar Module, our visual display now standing still. Our velocity digitals for Tranquility Base now reading zero. Reverting, if we could, to the terminology of an earlier form of transportation, the railroad. What we're witnessing now, is man's very first trip into space with a station stop along the route. At 105 hours 43 minutes, continuing to monitor the loop, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
105:46:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 16
105:47:17|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like some estimate of how far along you are with your eating and when you may be ready to start you EVA PREP. Over.
105:47:43|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I think that we'll be ready to start EVA PREP in about a half an hour or so.
105:47:50|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility.
105:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've only had one brief conversation over the past several minutes with Tranquility base. Capsule Communicator Owen Garriott asked when Tranquility base might start it's EVA prep, and Armstrong replied, about a half an hour or so. A normal time line for preparations for EVA would be approximately 2 hours. At 105 hours 52 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
105:50:00|P|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of acquisition on Columbia, now on it's 16th revolution around the Moon.
105:50:00|P|PAO|The capsule communicator you heard there is Bruce McCandless now on duty. Cliff Charlesworth's team of green Flight Controllers, by in large have returned to the
105:50:00|P|PAO|Control Center at this point. McCandless talked with both spacecraft and as you heard Neil Armstrong reporting from Tranquility Base, started that EVA preparations are now under way. At 106 hours 14 minutes now into the flight this is Apollo control Houston.
106:06:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 15 minutes. We'll still have acquisition of Columbia for another 8 minutes. All systems in Eagle still looking good. Cabin pressure 4.86 pounds showing a temperature of 63 degrees in the Eagle's cabin.
106:06:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Our best information at this time on the orientation of Eagle that the plus Z axis, that's the leg with the ladder on it, is yaw 13 degrees south of the ground track. The sun behind Eagle with the - the leg with the ladder on it in a generally westly direction along the ground track, but yaw at 13 degrees south from that ground track.
106:11:07|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. How do you read?
106:11:12|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia. This is Houston.
106:11:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, this is Tranquility Base. We are beginning our EVA PREP.
106:11:23|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston, Roger. Copy. You're beginning EVA PREP. Break. Break. Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.
106:11:35|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|You're loud and clear. The wastewater dump is down to 10 percent. I have a question on the P22. Do you want me to do another P22, or is all that information just for my own use in tracking the LM for photographic purposes?
106:11:49|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We request that you perform another P22. We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course. We're looking for marks on it; but tracking of geographical features doesn't do us all that much good. Over.
106:12:18|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Fine. I'll do it. And on the ECS system, the - Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without any changing of J52 sensors or anything like that. My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.
106:12:43|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Did you shift into manual control, or did the problem resolve itself under AUTO control? Over.
106:12:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|The problem went away under AUTO.
106:12:55|T|CC|Roger. That's the best type. Out.
106:12:56|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I did cycle out of AUTO into - I did cycle out of AUTO into MANUAL, back into AUTO.
106:13:05|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
106:15:00|P|PAO|The reference there is to dosimeter readings from the commander and the Lunar Module Pilot. You noted the precision of Buzz Aldrin on that last reading. At 106 hours 24 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, continuing to stand by, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
106:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 23 minutes, and we've had loss of signal on Columbia. The clock here in the Control Center counting down to depressurization time on Eagle shows we're 36 minutes 39 seconds away from that event. We believe the crew is pretty well on the time line in EVA preparations. We will next acquire Columbia at 108 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds. Columbia's closest approach to Eagle on this next revolution will come at 108 hours 35 minutes 28 seconds when it should be 3 miles south of the track.
106:22:56|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
106:23:05|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
106:23:07|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. We need a second set of PRD readings so that we may establish a rate. Over.
106:23:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Stand by.
106:23:30|T|CDR(TRANQ)|CDR is reading 11O14.
106:23:44|T|LMP(TRANQ)|LMP is reading 09017 and three quarters.
106:23:52|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. We copy your readings, Out.
106:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on that checklist report from Eagle, the crew appears to be about behind the timeline in EVA preparations.
106:29:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. How do you read on OMNI D, Dog?
106:29:30|T|CC|Columb ia, this is Houston. We're reading you loud with background noise on OMNI D. Over.
106:29:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. I'll stay on D here for a while. I'm about to go into ...
106:29:45|T|CC|Roger. Out.
106:36:14|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here on - AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock; the other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.
106:36:16|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may - -
106:36:19|T|CC|Now while we've got time, you can.
106:36:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|- - be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here? AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock. The other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.
106:36:44|T|CC|Stand by.
106:37:34|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.
106:38:05|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two oldlooking craters. Over.
106:38:40|O|CMP|Roger, Houston. Columbia ... up. I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time, hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
106:38:42|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
106:38:56|T|CC|Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.
106:39:17|O|CMP|It's going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see them.
106:39:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Its going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see anything.
106:39:26|T|CC|Roger. Out.
106:40:21|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
106:40:26|O|CMP|Go ahead.
106:40:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
106:40:33|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM 2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sightings. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Papa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.
106:40:57|O|CMP|Stand by 1.
106:40:59|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Stand by one.
106:41:01|T|CC|Roger.
106:42:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 52 minutes. We're 16 minutes away from acquisition of Columbia on it's 17th revolution of the Moon. We do not at this time have a good estimate for the start of the EVA. We'll have to wait until Eagles crew, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin, give us some more information about how they're coming along in the preparations for the EVA. Indications are now that they are running on the order of 30 minutes behind the nominal time, preparations line. Maybe a little bit longer. But we'll have to wait until we hear from them again before we can get a good estimate on the time for starting the EVA.
106:43:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.
106:43:02|T|CC|Go ahead, Columbia.
106:43:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|One of the craters I was talking about is located exactly at Mike 6.7.
106:43:19|T|CC|Roger. We found that one.
106:43:21|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|The other one is located at 7 - The other one is located at 7.2, two thirds of the way from Mike to Nan.
106:43:36|T|CC|Roger. We believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.
106:44:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?
106:44:17|T|CC|More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.
106:44:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Well, just give me your best estimate as to his location and his coordinate system, and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.
106:44:48|T|CC|Roger.
106:48:54|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Can you give us some idea of where you are in the surface checklist at the present time? Over.
106:49:03|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:49:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. We're at the top of page 27.
106:49:11|T|CC|Roger. Out
106:49:21|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:50:09|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:50:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:50:31|T|CC|Go ahead, Columbia.
106:50:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I finally got you back on OMNI D. I've been unsuccessfully trying to get you on the high-gain, and I've gone COMMAND RESET to PROCESS. How do you read me now?
106:50:46|T|CC|Roger. Reading you loud with background noise. Understand that's OMNI Delta or OMNI Bravo? Over.
106:50:56|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|OMNI Delta and you were cut out. I never got your coordinates on estimated LM position. Over.
106:51:04|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Estimated LM position is latitude plus 0.799, longitude over 2 plus 11.730. On your chart we would place it - Stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude.
106:51:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes. The latitude and longitude over 2, 799 and 11730 are the ones that I been using in P22. But what I'm interested in is - is grid coordinates on that map we're using.
106:52:01|T|CC|Roger. We'll have them for you in a second.
106:52:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
106:53:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Could you enable the S band relay at least one way from Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?
106:53:12|T|CC|Roger. There's not much going on at the present time, Columbia. I'll see what I can do about the relay.
106:53:21|O|CMP|Okay.
106:53:23|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Are you aware that Eagle plans the EVA about 4 hours early? Over.
106:53:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Affirmative. When's hatch open time in GET estinated?
106:53:39|T|CC|Roger. Somewhere around 108 hours. We'll have an update for you on that a little later.
106:53:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. I haven't heard a word from those guys, and I thought I'd be hearing them through your S band relay.
106:53:57|T|CC|Roger. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.
106:54:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Glad to hear it.
106:54:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|You got a crowd there in MCC?
106:54:40|T|CC|Roger. You're last, Columbia.
106:54:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I expect you probably have about nine CapcomS and 11 Flight Directors with no place to plug in.
106:54:53|T|CC|Roger. Out.
106:55:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That ratio might even be reversed.
106:55:37|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Glycol evaporator outlet temperature is 50 degrees and the comfort in here is just fine.
106:55:43|T|CC|Roger. We copy 50 degrees on the glycol, and comfort index fine.
106:56:25|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|If you'll excuse me a minute, I'm going to have a cup of coffee.
106:56:28|T|CC|Roger.
106:56:37|T|CC|Apollo - Columbia, this is Houston. Your map coordinates are Papa decimal 2 and 6 decimal 3 on the LAM 2 chart. Over.
106:57:10|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy the coordinates for the LM? Over.
106:58:49|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. If you read we request high-gain antenna, yaw 180, pitch 0. I say again, yaw 180, pitch 0 on the high-gain. Over.
107:02:15|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
107:05:13|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia on the high-gain.
107:05:15|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia on the high-gain.
107:05:18|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston reading you loud and clear. Over.
107:05:23|O|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Bruce. What's new?
107:05:25|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Read you loud and clear, Bruce.
107:05:26|T|CC|Roger, Mike. I have the coordinates - -
107:05:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|What's new?
107:05:31|T|CC|Well, what's new is I think we have some more coordinates for you on the LM location. Over.
107:05:39|O|CMP|Ready to copy.
107:05:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
107:05:43|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Papa 0.2 and 6.3 on your LAM 2 chart. Over.
107:06:02|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Papa 0.2 and who 0.3?
107:06:05|T|CC|6.3, I say again, 6.3.
107:06:17|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you. Papa 0.2 and 6.3. I'll try them.
107:06:21|T|CC|Roger.
107:06:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. What you are saying is, if you look at the cat's paw, then that's just about, oh - his middle finger, a little bit - one to two o'clock from his middle finger. Is that right?
107:07:16|T|CC|Roger. About one to two o'clock from the middle finger if you are using 12 o'clock being to the west. Over.
107:07:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That must be the way the cat's faced. Okay. I'm with you.
107:07:33|T|CC|Okay. And I got LOS amd AOS times for you.
107:07:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
107:07:48|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead, Houston.
107:07:50|T|CC|Roger. Your LOS at 107 plus 23 plus 03. AOS at 108 plus 09 plus 06. The next pass for COAS tracking: your time of closest approach is 108 35 28. That's 3 miles south of track. Over.
107:08:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I understand all that, but with this new information would you like me to try P22 and look for him in a different spot?
107:08:40|T|CC|Stand by a minute, please.
107:08:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Because I was looking in the wrong place last time. AUTO optics was not pointing me at the coordinates you gave me.
107:08:53|T|CC|Roger.
107:10:06|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
107:10:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
107:10:15|T|CC|On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. Over.
107:11:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?
107:11:24|T|CC|Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.
107:11:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
107:11:35|T|CC|And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we can track it on the next REV. If you are ready, we have a REFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.
107:12:06|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. P00 in ACCEPT you got. And this is an updated landing site RESFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?
107:12:15|T|CC|That's affirmative, Columbia.
107:12:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Good show.
107:15:34|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We are through with the uplink. It's your computer.
107:15:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Thank you.
107:19:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.
107:19:30|T|CC|Go ahead, Columbia.
107:19:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|On our next pass, I'd appreciate the S band relay mode. Over.
107:19:40|T|CC|Roger. We're working on that. There haven't been any transmissions from Tranquility Base since we last talked to you. We cannot give you a full S band relay without being assured of high-gain antenna. We're working on the partial relay for you. Over.
107:20:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Understand, Bruce. Thank you very much.
107:20:57|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Approximately 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems are looking good from down here. Over.
107:21:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Does it look to you like the 240 controller is properly controlling the glycol evaporator outlet TEMP? It locks all right up here.
107:21:19|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. During this pass on the front side, it looked okay to us.
107:21:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you.
107:31:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base.
107:31:03|T|CC|Go ahead Tranquility Base.
107:31:09|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. We are on about the middle of page 28, Surface - 28.
107:31:20|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We copy
107:38:16|T|CDR(TRANQ)|All right -

107:54:11|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We're coming up in about 6 minutes on GET of 108. If you'd like to start your event timer, we can give you a hack at 108 00. Over.
107:54:27|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Wilco.
108:01:03|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. We're ready to start with the electrical checkout. We're going to S band modulate FM. Over.
108:01:14|T|CC|Roger. Tranquility, this is Houston. We copy. Go ahead with the FM. And we missed the mark at 108. Do you want us to try and give you one at 108 05? Over.
108:01:27|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I think we've got the timer going. We've got 1 minute and 30 seconds.

108:07:37|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Mark. All right. Okay.
108:07:43|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Aren't they?
108:07:44|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Well, we've got antennas down and *** not real good, is it? Okay. Yours is up. We'll put my antenna up.
108:08:11|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay.
108:08:13|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
108:08:14|T|LMP(TRANQ)|How do you read now?
108:08:15|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
108:08:18|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. I think that's going to be better.
108:08:26|T|CDR(TRANQ)|You read me all right now?
108:08:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes.
108:08:30|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. That sounds pretty good.
108:08:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I guess it's a combination of the volume and the antenna. May have been just the volume that was way up too high. Why don't you try stowing it again; see if that makes any difference.
108:08:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
108:08:53|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That - That sounds pretty good.
108:08:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|... Okay?
108:08:59|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Better keep it pretty close to your mouth, though.
108:09:05|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Open up your audio circuit breaker, and disconnect the LM COMM cable.

108:14:53|T|CC|This is Houston. We copy, and right toward the end of your transmission after you mentioned lighted horizon, you trailed off down into the noise level, Neil. Over.
108:15:07|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
108:16:59|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Are you reading Tranquility all right on the relay? Over.
108:17:07|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I believe so. I haven't heard anything fairly lately, and it's breaking up. But up until about 3 minutes ago, I was reading them loud and clear.

108:38:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Let me get yours.
108:38:36|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Now we should be able to stow these. Huh?
108:40:10|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Any joy on the LM that pass? Over.
108:40:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. They're all stowed. Connect PLSS water hose to PGA. Let's see; let me do that.

108:41:44|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Our COMM just seemed to clear up a good bit. Did CSM just go over the hill?
108:41:52|T|CC|Negative. He's been over the hill, here, for a minute or so.
108:41:59|T|CC|Correction -
108:42:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.

108:47:18|T|CC|Roger. Were you successful in spotting the LM on that pass? Over.
108:47:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That's negative. I checked both locations, and no joy.
108:47:30|T|CC|Okay. If you'd like to look again next pass, we have a different set of coordinates based on the onboard P57 solution of the LM. These are Echo 0.3 and 4.8. I say again Echo 0.3, 4.8, same chart. Over.
108:48:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I'll look there. And, also, how about putting that in your machine and coming out with some coordinates: latitude and longitude over 2, and altitude for P22, so it can help me as best it can.
108:48:14|T|CC|Roger.
108:48:21|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That P22 is still pointing in the wrong way.

108:54:25|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That's 3.5. Are you in AUTO? Verify cabin pressure at 3.5 and LM suit circuit pressure between 3.6 and 4.3.
108:54:44|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It is. Suit circuit's at about 43.
108:54:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Verify the PGA pressure is above 45, minus 46.
108:54:53|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Minus 47.
108:54:54|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Will you give us hack when you start - -
108:54:57|T|CDR(TRANQ)|***
108:54:58|T|CC|- - your chronometer. Over.
108:55:03|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
108:55:08|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Give it to them later.
108:55:12|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Okay, let's go to dump.
108:55:17|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Dump. Go to dump.
108:55:40|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, I'll set my watch at 56. Over.
108:55:50|T|CC|Roger.
108:56:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|3, 2, 1.
108:56:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|MARK.
108:56:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia is back on the high-gain.
108:56:05|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear. And we copied you Mark there, Buzz.
108:56:09|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. I've got my water warning.
108:56:18|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Water warning.
108:56:20|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Is that yours?
108:56:21|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes. Got mine.
108:56:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Cabin pressure going towards zero. Verify LM suit circuit 36 to 43. That's verified. FIPGA pressure above 4.5. Okay. 4.7, coming down. Ready to open the hatch when we get to zero.
108:57:06|T|LMP(TRANQ)|You want to bring down one of your visors now or leave them up? I'll read *** okay.
108:57:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Inner visor down.
108:58:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Four tenths of a pound in the cabin.
108:59:06|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Down to about 0,2.
109:01:12|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Sure takes a long time to get all the way down, doesn't it?
109:01:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Yes.
109:02:45|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Let me see if it will open now.
109:02:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:03:00|P|PAO|Hatch reported coming open at 109 hours, 8 minutes, 05 seconds.
109:03:00|P|PAO|Correction - 109:07:35.
109:03:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Open my RCU there, would you, Buzz?
109:03:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Push outward.
109:04:23|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Need some light?
109:04:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It's unlocked, yes.
109:04:27|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Unlocked.
109:04:37|T|LMP(TRANQ)|That'll be good enough.
109:04:40|T|CDR(TRANQ)|It'll pop open.
109:05:23|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Get a steady tone in the background?
109:05:28|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I have a - static. A little bit of static.
109:05:34|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I've got a little bit of a steady tone.
109:05:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I don't guess I hear that.
109:06:15|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. What's your status on hatch opening? Over.
109:06:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Everything is GO here. Me're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so - to blow enough pressure to open the hatch. It's about 0.1 on our gage now.
109:06:48|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Sure hate to tug on that thing. Alternative would be to open *** too.
109:06:59|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Over.
109:07:04|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
109:07:05|T|CC|Roger. We're showing a relatively static pressure on your cabin. Do you think you can open the hatch at this pressure of about 1.2 psi?
109:07:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We're going to try it.
109:07:20|T|CC|Roger.
109:07:33|T|CDR(TRANQ)|The hatch is coming open.
109:07:40|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay, Hold it from going closed and I'll get the valve to - -
109:07:43|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:07:45|T|LMP(TRANQ)|No. I'd better get up first.
109:08:11|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. The valves in AUTO.
109:08:12|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:08:20|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Might want to fill it up to FORWARD.
109:08:37|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Your window cleared yet? Your water window cleared yet?
109:08:46|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It was, yes.
109:08:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Mine hasn't cleared yet.
109:08:55|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
109:09:00|P|PAO|They've been on the PLSS now for 16 and 1/2 minutes.
109:09:00|P|PAO|We're 8 minutes away from loss of signal on Columbia.
109:09:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong's suit pressure 4. -
109:09:01|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Go ahead.
109:09:03|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to cycle the fans in CRYO hydrogen tank number 1, and LOS time this orbit is 111 19 31.
109:09:23|T|CC|Correction - Make that for the next orbit. You already have the AOS/LOS for this orbit.
109:09:35|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger on time, and you want to cycle the fan in CRYO hydrogen tank 1.
109:09:41|T|CC|Roger. Out.
109:10:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Have you got your water valve on there?
109:10:41|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes.
109:12:35|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We show you nearing high-gain antenna scan limits. When you lose lock on us, we request OMNI Delta. OMNI Delta when you lose lock. Over.
109:12:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. OMNI Delta.
109:13:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. My window's cleared. I'm going to go to turn my cooling up a little bit.
109:13:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. My window's clear.
109:13:40|T|CDR(TRANQ)|All RCU windows are clear. And suit circuit is 42 - 43. And I got ascent pressure light, a VF light, and a ECS light.
109:14:00|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And we've got a water separater light. Hold it and I'll check.
109:14:03|T|CDR(TRANQ)|All right.
109:14:05|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And I'll look at your cabin fan 1 circuit breaker, and you look at glycol secondary.
109:14:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I've got good cooling now.
109:14:28|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Me, too.
109:14:35|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Glycol pump secondary circuit breaker open?
109:14:40|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I can see that. I have to lean this way.
109:14:48|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Can't go any further.
109:14:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|My cabin fan 1 ***
109:14:58|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes, That's good.
109:15:00|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Can you check it?
109:15:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong on the porch at 109 hours 19 minutes 16 seconds.
109:15:05|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It's open. Verified.
109:15:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. PGNS radar circuit breaker's open.
109:15:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Well, I'm looking head on at it. I'll get it.
109:15:32|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Let's get your antenna.
109:15:33|T|LMP(TRANQ)|You'll have to fix my antenna.
109:15:43|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Well, ready? - -
109:15:45|T|LMP(TRANQ)|About ready to go down and get some Moon rock?
109:15:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|My antenna's out. Okay. Now we're ready to hook up the LEC here.
109:16:12|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right. That should go down with no twists at all. Put the bag up this way, that's even. Neil, are you hooked up to it?
109:16:26|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Yes. Okay. Now we need to hook this.
109:16:30|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Move that up there.
109:16:34|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:16:38|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Your visor.
109:16:49|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Your back is up against the purse. All right. Now it's on top of the DSKY. Forward and up; now you are clear. Little bit toward me. Straight down, to your left a little bit. Plenty of room. Neil, you're lined up nicely. Toward me a little bit, down. Okay. Now you're clear. You're catching the first hinge on the bottom.
109:17:26|T|CDR(TRANQ)|What hinge?
109:17:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right. Move, here roll to the left. Okay. Now you're clear. You're lined up on the platform. Put your left foot to the right a little bit. Okay. That's good. Roll left, Good.
109:17:54|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Now I'm going to check PLSS here.
109:18:05|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. You're not quite squared away. Roll to the - roll right a little. Now you're even.
109:18:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That's okay?
109:18:15|T|LMP(TRANQ)|That's good. You've got plenty of room to your left. It's a little close on the ***
109:18:28|T|CDR(TRANQ)|How am I doing?
109:18:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|You're doing fine.
109:18:51|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Do you want those bags?
109:18:53|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Yes. Got it.
109:19:16|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Houston, I'm on the porch.
109:19:20|T|CC|Roger, Neil.
109:19:36|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Stand by, Neil.
109:19:37|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. One minute and 30 seconds to LOS. All systems GO. Over.
109:19:44|O|CMP|Columbia.
109:19:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Thank you.
109:19:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Stay where you are a minute, Neil.
109:19:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Need a little slack?
109:20:00|P|PAO|25 minutes of PLSS time expended now.
109:20:38|T|CDR(TRANQ)|You need more slack, Buzz?
109:20:40|T|LMP(TRANQ)|No. Hold it just a minute.
109:20:41|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:20:56|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Everything's nice and straight in here.
109:20:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Can you pull the door open a little more?
109:21:00|T|LMP(TRANQ)|All right.
109:21:03|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:21:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Did you get the MESA out?
109:21:09|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I'm going to pull it now.
109:21:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, the MESA came down all right.
109:21:22|T|CC|This is Houston, Roger. We copy. And we're standing by for your TV.
109:21:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, this is Neil. Radio check.
109:21:42|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Break. Break. Buzz, this is Houston. Radio check, and verify TV circuit breaker in.
109:21:54|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger, TV circuit breaker's in, and read you loud and clear.
109:22:00|T|CC|And, we're getting a picture on the TV.
109:22:08|T|LMP(TRANQ)|You got a good picture, huh?
109:22:11|T|CC|There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.
109:22:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?
109:22:35|T|CC|Stand by.
109:22:48|T|CC|Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.
109:22:59|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.
109:23:10|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
109:23:11|T|CDR(TRANQ)|It takes a pretty good little jump.
109:23:25|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. F/2 - 1/160th second for shadow photography on the sequence camera.
109:23:35|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay.
109:23:38|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.
109:24:14|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I'm going to step off the LM now.
109:24:25|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.
109:24:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.
109:25:00|P|PAO|Unofficial time on the first step - 109:24:20.
109:25:00|P|PAO|The Surgeon says that -
109:25:00|P|PAO|The Surgeon says the crew is doing well. Data is good, crew is doing well.
109:25:30|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.
109:25:45|T|CDR(EVA)|There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.
109:26:54|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?
109:26:59|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.
109:27:03|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:27:07|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.
109:27:13|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.
109:27:28|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. It's taut now.
109:27:51|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.
109:27:55|T|CDR(EVA)|I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -
109:28:01|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.
109:28:02|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:28:17|T|CDR(EVA)|Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in tne shadow now looking up at Buzz in the window. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible,
109:28:55|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I'm going to be changing the -
109:28:58|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:30:00|P|PAO|35 and a half minutes of PLSS time expended now.
109:30:23|T|CDR(EVA)|The camera is installed on the RCU bracket, and I'm storing the LEC on the secondary strut.
109:30:53|T|CDR(EVA)|I'll step out and take some of my first pictures here.
109:31:05|T|CC|Roger. Neil, we're reading you loud and clear. We see you getting some pictures and the contingency sample.
109:32:19|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Did you copy about the contingency sample? Over.
109:32:26|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.
109:33:25|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.
109:33:27|T|CDR(EVA)|Right.
109:33:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. That's good.
109:33:58|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ***. Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.
109:34:12|T|CDR(EVA)|This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.
109:34:54|T|LMP(EVA)|That looks beautiful from here, Neil.
109:34:56|T|CDR(EVA)|It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.
109:35:30|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
109:35:43|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. The handle is off the *** in about 6 or 8 inches into the surface. I could - easy -.
109:35:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.
109:36:07|T|LMP(EVA)|Now, you can throw so far.
109:36:08|T|CDR(EVA)|You can really throw things a long way up here.
109:36:32|T|CDR(EVA)|That pocket open, Buzz?
109:36:35|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.
109:36:37|T|CDR(EVA)|That in the pocket?
109:36:42|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. Push down.
109:36:55|T|CDR(EVA)|Got it?
109:36:57|T|LMP(EVA)|No. It's not all the way in. Push it. There you go.
109:37:08|T|CDR(EVA)|Contingency sample is in the pocket. My oxygen is 81 percent. I have no flags, and I'm in minimum flow.
109:37:22|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger, Neil.
109:37:40|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I have got the cameras on at one frame a second.
109:37:44|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:37:52|T|LMP(EVA)|And I've got the 80 percent, no flags.
109:38:00|T|CDR(EVA)|Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston?
109:38:05|T|CC|Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.
109:38:22|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.
109:38:33|T|CDR(EVA)|...
109:38:35|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger.
109:38:36|T|CDR(EVA)|Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.
109:38:41|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?
109:38:42|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.
109:39:00|P|PAO|45 minutes PLSS time expended.
109:39:00|P|PAO|It's the sample return containers, the rock boxes that Capcom -
109:39:00|P|PAO|Both PLSS's nominal on consumables.
109:39:06|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:39:07|T|LMP(EVA)|All right. That's got it. Are you ready?
109:39:11|T|CDR(EVA)|All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.
109:39:43|T|LMP(EVA)|All right. The backup camera's positioned.
109:39:57|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.
109:40:18|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?
109:40:27|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.
109:40:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Back in *** little of foot movement - porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.
109:40:48|T|CDR(EVA)|Looks good.
109:41:08|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.
109:41:18|T|CDR(EVA)|Negative.
109:41:28|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.
109:41:47|T|LMP(EVA)|Making sure not to lock it on my way ¢ut.
109:41:53|T|CDR(EVA)|(Laughter) A pretty good thought.
109:41:56|T|LMP(EVA)|That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.
109:42:18|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.
109:42:28|T|CDR(EVA)|You've got three more steps and then a long one.
109:42:42|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.
109:42:50|T|CDR(EVA)|There you go.
109:42:53|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ***
109:43:01|T|CDR(EVA)|A little more. About another inch.
109:43:05|T|CDR(EVA)|THERE YOU GOT IT.
109:43:08|T|CDR(EVA)|That's a good step. About a 3-footer.
109:43:16|T|LMP(EVA)|Beautiful view!
109:43:18|T|CDR(EVA)|Isn't that something! Magnificent sight out here.
109:43:24|T|LMP(EVA)|Magnificent desolation.
109:43:47|T|LMP(EVA)|Looks like the secondary strut - little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.
109:43:54|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. I noticed that. That seems to be the worst, although similar effects are on - all around.
109:44:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 18
109:44:07|T|MS|... powder, isn't it?
109:44:09|T|CDR(EVA)|Isn't it fine?
109:44:11|T|LMP(EVA)|Right in this area I don't think there's much of any *** fine powder *** clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.
109:44:23|T|CDR(EVA)|Notice how you can kick it out.
109:44:28|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. And it bounces and then -
109:44:55|T|LMP(EVA)|Reaching down is fairly easy. I got my suit dirty at this stage.
109:45:11|T|LMP(EVA)|The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.
109:45:30|T|LMP(EVA)|There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to *** backwards *** due to the soft, very soft texture.
109:45:45|T|CDR(EVA)|You're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.
109:46:01|T|LMP(EVA)|This pad sure didn't ***
109:46:05|T|CDR(EVA)|No. It didn't.
109:46:08|T|LMP(EVA)|There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.
109:46:10|T|CDR(EVA)|No.
109:46:12|T|LMP(EVA)|I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.
109:46:20|T|CDR(EVA)|I'd like that.
109:46:25|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.
109:46:30|T|LMP(EVA)|I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.
109:46:40|T|CDR(EVA)|It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.
109:47:04|T|LMP(EVA)|Can't say too much for the visibility right here without the visor up. It's dark. It looks like there is a *** surface of it is *** pounded rock *** And incidentally, these rocks *** very powdery surface ***
109:47:40|T|CC|Say again, please, Buzz; you're cutting out.
109:47:45|T|LMP(EVA)|I say that the rocks are rather slippery.
109:47:50|T|CC|Roger.
109:47:52|T|LMP(EVA)|A powdery surface when the sun hits. *** they split up all the very little fine porouses *** Will tend to slide over it rather easily.
109:48:25|T|LMP(EVA)|Traction ... seems quite good. ...
109:48:30|T|LMP(EVA)|*** About to lose my balance in one direction and recovery is a quite natural and very easy *** And, moving your arms around, Jack, doesn't *** off the surface *** not quite that light-footed.
109:49:00|P|PAO|Biotite is a brown mica substance.
109:49:00|P|PAO|Life Support Consumables still looking good.
109:49:06|T|CDR(EVA)|And, I have the insulation off the MESA now and MESA seems to be in good shape.
109:49:13|T|LMP(EVA)|Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you *** slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.
109:49:37|T|LMP(EVA)|And, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?
109:49:42|T|CDR(EVA)|Find a purple rock?
109:49:44|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. They are small, sparkly *** fragments *** places *** would make a first guess that some sort of biotite *** We'll leave that to further analysis ***
109:50:28|T|LMP(EVA)|*** compact underneath *** completely no *** you don't sink down more than ... a quarter of an inch.
109:50:59|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay, Houston. I'm going to change lenses on you.
109:51:05|T|CC|Roger, Neil.
109:51:30|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay, Houston. Tell me if you're getting a new picture.
109:51:35|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. That's affirmative. We're getting a new picture. You can tell it's a longer focal length lens. And for your information, all LM systems are GO. Over.
109:51:46|T|LMP(EVA)|We appreciate that. Thank you.
109:52:19|T|LMP(EVA)|Neil is now unveiling the plaque *** gear.
109:52:27|T|CC|Roger. We got you boresighted, but back under one track.
109:52:40|T|CDR(EVA)|For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says "Here Man from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.
109:53:35|T|CDR(EVA)|Ready for the camera?
109:53:38|T|LMP(EVA)|No. I'll get it. No, you take this TV on out.
109:53:45|T|CDR(EVA)|Watch the LEC, there.
109:53:53|T|LMP(EVA)|Now I'm afreid these ... materials are going to get dusty ***
109:54:00|P|PAO|If you stand on the ladder facing forward, the minus Y strap is the landing gear to your left.
109:54:07|T|LMP(EVA)|The surface material is powdery. *** How good your lens is, but if you can *** smudges ... very much like a very finely powdered carbon, but it's very pretty looking.
109:54:40|T|CDR(EVA)|Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?
109:54:58|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus ?
109:55:02|T|CC|This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It is somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.
109:55:21|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. How's the temperature on there?
109:55:25|T|CDR(EVA)|Temperature of the camera is showing zero.
109:55:32|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm a little cool. I think I'll trade ***
109:55:43|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm on intermediate now, Houston, and I show 3.78. No flags, 70 ***
109:55:50|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
109:55:57|T|LMP(EVA)|And, we'll probably need a little *** distance *** back location *** television camera.
109:56:14|T|LMP(EVA)|Neil, look at the minus Y-strut, the direction of travel there *** travel from right to left.
109:56:24|T|CDR(EVA)|Right.
109:56:25|T|LMP(EVA)|This one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-Y probe first hit.
109:56:35|T|CDR(EVA)|I got plenty of cable?
109:56:38|T|LMP(EVA)|You've got plenty. Plenty more.
109:56:48|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I think I've got the end of it.
109:56:51|T|CDR(EVA)|Something interesting: in the bottom of this little crater here - It may be -
109:57:01|T|LMP(EVA)|Now keep going. We've got a lot more.
109:57:03|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:57:04|T|LMP(EVA)|Getting a little harder to pull out, here.
109:57:30|T|CDR(EVA)|How far would you say I am, Buzz?
109:57:33|T|LMP(EVA)|Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?
109:57:42|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:57:45|T|LMP(EVA)|You're backing into the cable.
109:57:46|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:57:50|T|LMP(EVA)|Turn around to your right, would be better.
109:57:53|T|CDR(EVA)|I don't want to go into the Sun if I can avoid it.
109:57:55|T|LMP(EVA)|That's right. Yes.
109:57:59|T|CDR(EVA)|I'll just leave it - -
109:58:01|T|LMP(EVA)|- - All right.
109:58:02|T|CDR(EVA)|- - sit like that and walk around it.
109:58:06|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston. How's that field of view going to pick up the MESA? *** far away?
109:58:15|T|CC|Roger.
109:58:20|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. The field of view is okay. We'd like you to aim it a little bit more to the right. Over.
109:58:28|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
109:58:32|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. That's all the cable we have. *** not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -
109:58:40|T|CC|A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?
109:58:50|T|CC|Okay. That looks good Neil.
109:58:55|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?
109:59:00|P|PAO|1 hour, 7 minutes time expended.
109:59:00|P|PAO|Buzz is erecting the solar wind experiment now.
109:59:01|T|LMP(EVA)|Can't get too much further away.
109:59:05|T|CDR(EVA)|Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.
109:59:13|T|CC|Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -
109:59:28|T|CDR(EVA)|I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.
109:59:35|T|CC|Roger.
109:59:40|T|CDR(EVA)|It's taken just a little - about north, north east.
109:59:52|T|CDR(EVA)|Tell me if you've got a picture, Houston.
109:59:54|T|CC|We've got a beautiful picture, Neil.
109:59:58|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. I'm going to move it.
110:00:10|T|CC|Okay. Here's another good one.
110:00:23|T|CC|Okay, we got that one.
110:00:29|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.
110:00:41|T|CC|Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.
110:00:52|T|CDR(EVA)|All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.
110:01:16|T|CC|Roger.
110:01:26|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.
110:01:33|T|CC|We've got this view, Neil.
110:01:42|T|CDR(EVA)|This is straight south.
110:01:45|T|CC|Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.
110:01:48|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.
110:02:20|T|CC|Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.
110:02:22|T|CDR(EVA)|How's that for a final?
110:02:26|T|CC|For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees. Over.
110:02:36|T|CC|Now back to the right about half as much.
110:02:42|T|CDR|Okay?
110:02:53|T|CC|Okay. That looks good there, Neil.
110:03:00|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
110:03:20|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. You can make a Mark, Houston. *** deployed.
110:03:24|T|CC|Roger. Solar wind.
110:03:36|T|LMP(EVA)|And, incidently, you can use the shadow that the staff makes to *** getting it perpendicular ***
110:03:50|T|CC|Roger.
110:04:00|P|PAO|All LM systems still looking good.
110:04:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong has been on the lunar surface now almost 45 minutes.
110:04:05|T|LMP(EVA)|Some of these small depressions *** tend to sink - oh, maybe 2 or 3 inches. *** suggest exactly what the Surveyor pictures showed when they pushed away a little bit. You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface, when in fact it really isn't.
110:04:43|T|CDR(EVA)|I noticed in the soft spots where we had footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a - will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees along side of the footprints.
110:06:29|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay?
110:06:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. I think that's excellent.
110:06:39|T|LMP(EVA)|They didn't come off?
110:06:46|T|LMP(EVA)|*** get the ***
110:07:01|T|CDR(EVA)|*** that part? *** a rock here.
110:07:38|T|LMP(EVA)|You'll have to extend that one.
110:07:58|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
110:08:26|T|LMP(EVA)|***
110:08:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia on the high-gain. Over.
110:08:54|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia on the high-gain. Over.
110:08:55|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.
110:09:01|O|CMP|I'm reading you loud and clear. How's it going?
110:09:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes. Reading you loud and clear. How's it going?
110:09:05|T|CC|Roger. The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they are setting up the flag now.
110:09:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Great.
110:09:18|T|CC|I guess you're about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of the scene.
110:09:25|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That's all right. I don't mind a bit.
110:09:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|How is the quality of the TV?
110:09:35|T|CC|Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is.
110:09:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting half way decent?
110:09:43|T|CC|Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on the lunar surface.
110:09:50|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Beautiful. Just beautiful.
110:10:16|T|LMP(EVA)|That's good. See if you can pull that end off a little bit. Take that end up a little.
110:10:33|T|CDR(EVA)|It won't pull out.
110:10:39|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
110:12:21|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
110:12:27|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
110:12:29|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:12:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Loud and clear, Houston.
110:12:32|T|CC|Roger, Buzz.
110:13:15|T|LMP(EVA)|I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person can *** traveling on the lunar surface. I believe I'm out of your field of view. Is that right, now, Houston?
110:13:30|T|CC|That's affirmative, Buzz.
110:13:37|T|CC|You are in our field of view now.
110:13:42|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.
110:14:05|T|LMP(EVA)|About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.
110:14:38|T|LMP(EVA)|So called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.
110:15:06|T|LMP(EVA)|It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity forces.
110:15:47|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please?
110:16:00|T|CDR(EVA)|Say again, Houston.
110:16:02|T|CC|Roger. We'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.
110:16:09|T|CC|Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.
110:16:23|T|CDR(EVA)|That would be an honor.
110:16:25|T|CC|Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.
110:16:30|T|PRESIDENT NIXON|Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you *** for every American. This has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.
110:17:44|T|CDR(EVA)|Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.
110:18:12|T|PRESIDENT NIX0N|And thank you very much and I look forward - All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.
110:18:21|T|LMP(EVA)|I look forward to that very much, sir.
110:18:31|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
110:18:37|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Loud and clear, Houston.
110:18:39|T|CC|Roger. I got a P22 AUTO optics - AUTO optics PAD for you.
110:18:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Go ahead.
110:18:56|T|CC|Roger. P22 landmark ID, LM: T1, 110 26 56; T2, 110 32 06. Three miles south; time of closest approach, 110 33 40. Shaft 353.855, trunnion 46.495, roll zero, pitch 250, yaw zero. Over.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong has the scoop for the bulk sample collection.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Neil's been on the surface a hour now. Buz not quite twenty minutes; less than that.
110:19:00|P|PAO|One hour and a half expended on the PLSS's now.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Heart rates on both crewmen have been averaging between 90 and 100. Flight surgeon reports they're right on the predicted number of the Btu units expended in energy of work. And he thinks they're in great shape.
110:19:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Thank you. Readback not required.
110:19:55|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:20:06|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston, it's very interesting to note that when I kick my foot *** with no atmosphere here, and this gravity *** they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity. From where I stand, a large portion of them will impact at a certain distance out. Several *** the percentage is, of course, that will impact *** different regions *** it's highly dependent upon *** the initial trajectory upward *** where most of the *** already the particles are found, ... terrain.
110:21:08|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. And break. Break. Columbia, this is Houston. When you track out of high-gain antenna, then let's request OMNI Delta, OMNI Delta. Over.
110:21:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|So be it.
110:21:24|T|LMP(EVA)|I've noticed several times in going from the sunlight into the shadow, that just as I go in, I catch an additional reflection off the LM *** along with the reflection off my face onto the visor, makes visibility very poor just at the transition *** sunlight into the shadow. I essentially have so much glare coming onto my visor *** shadow *** helmet actually gets the shadow. Than it takes a short while for my eyes to adapt to the lighting conditions. *** inside the shadow area, visibility, as we said before, is not too great, but both visor's up *** what sort of footprints we have and the general condition of the soil. Then, after being out in the sunlight a while, it takes - Watch it, Neil! Neil, you're on the cable.
110:22:40|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
110:22:41|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. Lift up your right foot, right foot. It's still - your toe is still hooked in it.
110:22:45|T|CDR(EVA)|That one?
110:22:46|T|LMP(EVA)|Yes. It's still hooked in it. Wait a minute. Okay. You're clear now.
110:22:51|T|CDR(EVA)|Thank you.
110:22:55|T|LMP(EVA)|Now, let's move that over this way.
110:23:04|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I've got it.
110:23:32|T|LMP(EVA)|The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this *** still don't know exactly what color to describe this other than ash cocoa color. It seems to be covering most of the lighter part of the boot *** color that *** very fine particles ***.
110:24:11|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. You're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. Can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? Over.
110:24:23|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. I'll try that.
110:24:25|T|CC|Beautiful.
110:24:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.
110:24:35|T|CC|It sounded a little wet.
110:25:09|T|LMP(EVA)|In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any *** thermal effects. *** inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.
110:25:41|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
110:26:05|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
110:26:55|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
110:27:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia in Delta.
110:27:05|T|CC|Roger. You should have VHF AOS with the LM right about now. VHF LOS will be about 40 minutes 15 seconds. Over.
110:27:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
110:28:22|T|LMP(EVA)|As I look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down Sun ... very light colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own shadow, around the shadow of my helmet. Then, as I look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surrounding color is still fairly light. As you look down into the Sun *** a larger amount of *** shadowed area is looking toward us. The general color of the *** surrounding *** the contrast is not as great. Surveying all the dusty area that we've kicked up *** considerably darker in texture. Now, I've kicked up one, and I imagine that this is *** Surveyor. The same is true when I survey across on - along the area that we're walking. In general *** to the fact that there are footprints there. General terrain where I've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast *** color.
110:29:00|P|PAO|You can Neil Armstrong bringing scoop - -
110:29:00|P|PAO|Neil is filling the bulk sample bag attached to a scale as seen in the picture. Buzz is behind the LM at the minus Z strut. That's the landing gear directly opposite the ladder. Neil's been on the surface about an hour and 10 minutes.
110:31:29|T|LMP(EVA)|The panorama I'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***
110:31:39|T|CC|Say again which strut, Buzz?
110:31:43|T|LMP(EVA)|The plus Z strut.
110:31:47|T|CC|Roger.
110:31:48|T|LMP(EVA)|And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... There's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.
110:34:00|P|PAO|Buzz is making his way around the LM photographing it from various angles, looking at its condition on all sides. Neil still occupied with the bulk sample. 1 hour 40 minutes time expended on the PLSS's now.
110:34:13|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm now in the area of the minus Y strut taking some ... photographs.
110:35:52|T|LMP(EVA)|How's the bulk sample coming, Neil?
110:35:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Bulk sample is just being sealed.
110:36:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.
110:37:01|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
110:37:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. No marks on the LM that time. I did see a suspiciously small white object whose coordinates are - -
110:37:25|T|CC|Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.
110:37:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest end of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.
110:37:58|T|CC|Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -
110:38:27|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111 19 31; AOS, 112 05 43. Over.
110:39:00|P|PAO|Neil has finished collecting and packing the bulk sample.
110:39:04|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.
110:39:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Negative, Houston. You broke. Disregard. I'll get them off the Flight Plans.
110:39:19|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:39:56|T|LMP(EVA)|The jet deflector that's mounted on quad 1 seems to be a good bit more wrinkled *** right now on quad 4.
110:40:12|T|CC|You're breaking up again, Buzz.
110:40:18|T|LMP(EVA)|I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the LM that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.
110:40:53|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:40:58|T|LMP(EVA)|We're going to get some particular photographs of the bulk sample area, Neil?
110:41:07|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
110:41:25|T|LMP(EVA)|And, Houston? Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming *** fingered.
110:42:01|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger. And Neil has 66 percent O2, no flags, minimum cooling, and the suit pressure is 382.
110:42:14|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.
110:42:39|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. Have you removed the closeup camera from the MESA yet? Over.
110:42:50|T|LMP(EVA)|Negative. Thank you.
110:43:18|T|LMP(EVA)|*** get the panorama now. Okay.
110:43:33|T|LMP(EVA)|Did you get it?
110:43:50|T|CDR(EVA)|Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?
110:43:55|T|CC|Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.
110:44:00|P|PAO|Neil's been on the surface now slightly over an hour and 20 minutes.
110:44:03|T|CDR(EVA)|All right.
110:44:45|T|CC|Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.
110:45:03|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger. I understand that.
110:46:36|T|CDR(EVA)|I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.
110:47:17|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:47:18|T|LMP(EVA)|It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?
110:47:37|T|CDR(EVA)|At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.
110:47:55|T|LMP(EVA)|Nice paint job.
110:48:04|T|LMP(EVA)|I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.
110:48:48|T|LMP(EVA)|There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.
110:49:00|P|PAO|The SEQ Bay contains the scientific experiments to be left on the surface of the Moon; the laser reflector.
110:49:00|P|PAO|The surgeon says everything looks fine.
110:50:26|T|LMP(EVA)|This is too big an angle, Neil.
110:50:34|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. I think you are right.
110:51:29|T|LMP(EVA)|We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.
110:52:01|T|LMP(EVA)|And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.
110:52:05|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
110:52:07|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -
110:52:16|T|CC|Go ahead, Buzz.
110:52:20|T|LMP(EVA)|Taking some close up pictures of that rock.
110:52:27|T|LMP(EVA)|I was saying that, Houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***
110:52:47|T|CC|Roger.
110:52:57|T|LMP(EVA)|Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?
110:53:00|T|CC|Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.
110:53:08|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -
110:53:13|T|CC|Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.
110:53:38|T|LMP(EVA)|All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.
110:53:46|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high-gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.
110:54:00|P|PAO|An hour and a half of lunar surface time for Neil Armstrong.
110:54:00|P|PAO|They've been in the portable life support systems for 2 hours now.
110:54:00|P|PAO|That's Neil Armstrong to the left of the screen. That - -
110:54:00|P|PAO|Buzz Aldrin coming into view on the right carrying the two experiments.
110:54:00|P|PAO|And, they will be out of the cameras field of view while setting up these experiments.
110:54:03|T|LMP(EVA)|You want to pick an area, Neil?
110:54:05|T|CC|Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high-gain.
110:54:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia is locked up on the high-gain, Houston.
110:54:16|T|CC|Roger. Out.
110:55:42|T|LMP|Houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually.
110:55:49|T|CC|Roger.
110:56:30|T|LMP(EVA)|And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.
110:56:51|T|CC|Roger.
110:57:05|T|CDR(EVA)|And, the panorama is complete. *** and the LM - got the LM at 7 30 position at about 60 feet.
110:57:39|T|CDR(EVA)|And the doors are closed and locked.
110:57:43|T|CC|Roger.
110:57:50|T|LMP(EVA)|Have you got us a good area picked out?
110:57:53|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.
110:58:08|T|CDR(EVA)|I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -
110:58:16|T|LMP(EVA)|Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -
110:58:19|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?
110:58:24|T|LMP(EVA)|Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.
110:58:44|T|CDR(EVA)|About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -
110:58:50|T|LMP(EVA)|It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.
110:58:55|T|CDR(EVA)|The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?
110:59:00|P|PAO|- - while setting up these experiments.
110:59:03|T|LMP(EVA)|All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?
110:59:07|T|CDR(EVA)|All right.
110:59:10|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.
110:59:19|T|CDR(EVA)|I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?
110:59:25|T|LMP(EVA)|I think this right here is just as level.
111:00:00|T|CDR(EVA)|These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.
111:02:08|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***
111:02:34|T|CC|You're cutting out again, Buzz.
111:02:49|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.
111:03:57|T|CDR(EVA)|The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.
111:04:00|P|PAO|The bubble they're discussing is on a leveling device on the passive seismometer.
111:04:00|P|PAO|Two twelve is the time expended on the PLSS.
111:04:16|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.
111:04:23|T|LMP(EVA)|Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?
111:04:30|T|CDR(EVA)|I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.
111:04:37|T|LMP(EVA)|That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.
111:04:48|T|CDR(EVA)|That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.
111:04:53|T|LMP(EVA)|I think you're right.
111:04:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Believe it is.
111:04:57|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.
111:05:19|T|CC|Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.
111:05:28|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay.
111:06:03|T|CDR(EVA)|...
111:06:20|T|CDR(EVA)|There you go. Good work; good show. Hey, whoa; stop, stop! Back up.
111:06:34|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston, as I was spacing the PSE, the right hand solar array deployed automatically. The left hand I had to manually *** the bar at the far end.
111:06:56|T|LMP(EVA)|All parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.
111:07:02|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. I understand that you did successfully deploy both solar arrays. Over.
111:07:10|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. That's affirmative. And there isn't any way of telling whether that's lined up. I'm getting in the way; maybe I can get down here.
111:07:38|T|LMP(EVA)|Neil, how does that appear to be pointing?
111:08:08|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Over.
111:08:13|T|CDR(EVA)|Go ahead, Houston.
111:08:15|T|CC|Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.
111:08:45|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. That sounds fine.
111:08:47|T|CC|Roger. Out.
111:09:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong has been on the surface now about an hour and fifty minutes. In the foreground Buzz Aldrin is collecting a core tube sample.
111:09:07|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. If you're still in the vicinity of the PSE, could you get a photograph of the ball level? Over.
111:09:16|T|CDR(EVA)|I'll do that, Buzz.
111:09:18|T|LMP(EVA)|Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.
111:09:43|T|CDR(EVA)|Oh, shoot. Would you believe the ball is right in the middle now?
111:09:50|T|LMP(EVA)|Wonderful. Take a picture before it moves.
111:10:00|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We're estimating about 10 minutes for the documented sampling. Over.
111:10:25|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
111:10:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead, Houston. Columbia.
111:10:36|T|CC|Roger. Like you to terminate charging battery Bravo at 111 plus 15. Over.
111:10:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|How about right now?
111:10:49|T|CC|Roger.
111:11:15|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. You've got about 10 minutes left now prior to commencing your EVA termination activities. Over.
111:11:31|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. I understand.
111:12:32|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. The passive seismic experiment has been uncaged and we're observing short period oscillations in it. Over.
111:14:00|P|PAO|The core tubes provide material - -
111:14:00|P|PAO|That's Buzz Aldrin retrieving the solar wind experiment.
111:15:13|T|LMP(EVA)|I hope you're watching how hard I have to hit this into the ground, to the tune of about 5 inches, Houston.
111:15:22|T|CC|Roger.
111:15:35|T|LMP(EVA)|It almost looks wet.
111:15:46|T|CDR(EVA)|Got a sample.
111:15:57|T|LMP(EVA)|Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, you cut the cable again.
111:16:03|T|CC|All right, Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. We'd like you to - -
111:16:04|T|MS|...
111:16:10|T|CDR(EVA)|That clear?
111:16:11|T|LMP(EVA)|Not quite.
111:16:13|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We'd like you all to get two core tubes and the solar wind experiment; two core tubes and the solar wind. Over.
111:16:25|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger.
111:16:51|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. While I'm getting the next one, maybe you can - ... away the box a little bit.
111:17:04|T|CDR(EVA)|...
111:18:04|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. You have approximately 3 minutes until you must commence your EVA termination activities. Over.
111:18:14|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. Understand.
111:18:22|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Approximately 1 minute to LOS. Over.
111:18:29|O|CMP|Columbia. Roger.
111:18:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Roger.
111:18:37|T|CC|And, do you plan on commencing your sleep on the backside this pass? If so, we'll disable uplink to you while we're talking to the LM. Over.
111:18:49|O|CMP|Negative that.
111:18:51|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Negative that.
111:18:59|T|LMP(EVA)|Houston, were you able to record the documentary way where the two core tube samples were taken?
111:19:00|P|PAO|They've been on their life support systems 2 hours and 25 minutes. Neil appears to be picking up rocks to the right of the screen.
111:19:00|P|PAO|We want to keep a good margin in those portable life support systems.
111:19:00|P|PAO|That white dot, right above the horizon on the right is a phosphorus spot from the TV converter.
111:19:12|T|CC|Negative. Out.
111:19:19|T|CDR(EVA)|I didn't get a stereopair of those two, but they are right in the vicinity of the solar wind.
111:19:29|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. After you've got the core tubes and the solar wind, anything else that you can throw into the box would be acceptable.
111:19:44|T|CDR(EVA)|Righto.
111:19:58|T|CDR(EVA)|Cap ...
111:20:01|T|LMP(EVA)|I got the cap.
111:20:03|T|CDR(EVA)|Got the cap?
111:20:04|T|LMP(EVA)|They're both good caps on ...
111:20:05|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:20:07|T|LMP(EVA)|And, you want to pick up some stuff, and I'll - -
111:20:09|T|CDR(EVA)|Get these aseptic ones.
111:20:11|T|LMP(EVA)|- - Move the solar wind in.
111:21:05|T|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. It's about time for you to start your EVA closeout activities.
111:21:16|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger. That's in progress.
111:22:20|T|CC|Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. We'd like to remind you of the closeup camera magazine before you start up the ladder, Buzz.
111:22:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Got that over with you, Neil?
111:22:34|T|CDR(EVA)|No, the closeup camera's underneath the MESA. I'll have to pick it up with the prong. I'm picking up several pieces of really vesicular rock out here, now.
111:22:53|T|LMP(EVA)|You didn't get anything in those environmental samples, did you?
111:22:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Not yet.
111:22:59|T|LMP(EVA)|Well, I don't think we'll have time.
111:23:07|T|CC|Roger, Neil and Buzz. Let's press on with getting the closeup camera magazine and closing out of the sample return container. We're running a little low on time.
111:23:19|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger.
111:24:00|P|PAO|spot from the TV converter in the park station in Australia.
111:24:00|P|PAO|Neil's been on the surface a few minutes longer than two hours. Buzz, approximately 20 minutes less than that.
111:24:04|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Can you quickly stick this in my pocket, Neil, and I'll head on up the ladder?
111:24:07|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:24:18|T|LMP(EVA)|I'll hold it. You open the packet up.
111:24:39|T|CDR(EVA)|... that'd kill us. Just hold it right there. Okay. Let the pocket go.
111:24:49|T|LMP(EVA)|About through?
111:24:52|T|CDR(EVA)|Got it.
111:24:53|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Adios, amigo.
111:24:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:24:58|T|LMP(EVA)|Anything more before I head on up, Bruce?
111:25:04|T|CC|Negative. Head on up the ladder, Buzz.
111:25:57|T|LMP(EVA)|How are you coming, Neil?
111:25:58|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:26:22|T|CDR(EVA)|Did you get that solar wind rolled up there, Buzz?
111:26:24|T|LMP(EVA)|Right. That's it right there.
111:26:25|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:26:47|T|LMP(EVA)|Think you can reach the - reach this hook that's hanging over here? You might entertain the idea of sending up the second one that way.
111:26:59|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:27:05|T|LMP(EVA)|Get the film off of that.
111:27:08|T|CDR(EVA)|I will. Get that up now.
111:27:23|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I'm heading on in.
111:27:24|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay.
111:27:26|T|LMP(EVA)|And I'll get the LEC all ready for the rock box.
111:28:02|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Did the Hasselblad magazine go up on that sample return container also?
111:28:12|T|CDR(EVA)|I've got the Hasselblad magazine hooked to the SRC now, yes.
111:28:17|T|CC|Roger.
111:28:58|T|CDR(EVA)|How are you doing, Buzz?
111:29:00|T|LMP(EVA)|I'm okay.
111:29:00|P|PAO|Transferring the sample containers into the LM cabin now.
111:29:00|P|PAO|The Lick Observatory in California reports a return on that lazer experiment.
111:29:34|T|LMP(EVA)|About ready to send up the LEC?
111:29:39|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes. Just about.
111:30:01|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay.
111:30:45|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. That's got it clear.
111:31:04|T|CDR(EVA)|Oh. Uh - oh. The camera came off. I mean the film pack came off.
111:31:30|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Just ease it down now. Don't pull so hard on it. All right, let it go.
111:31:46|T|CDR(EVA)|While you're getting that, I've got to get the camera.
111:31:55|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. This - This one's in. No problem.
111:31:58|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. Stand by a second.
111:32:02|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Request an EMU check. Over.
111:32:09|T|CDR(EVA)|Roger. Got 3.8 and I got 54 on the O2 and no flags, and my flow is in N.
111:33:46|T|CC|Neil and Buzz, for your information, your consumables remain in good shape. Out.
111:33:53|T|LMP(EVA)|Roger, How's it coming, Neil?
111:33:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. I've got one side hooked up to the second box and I've got the film pack on.
111:34:00|P|PAO|Two hours and 40 minutes on the PLSS's.
111:34:00|P|PAO|Unofficial time off the surface at 111:37:32.
111:34:01|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Good.
111:34:20|T|CDR(EVA)|Boy, that bilge from on the LEC is kind of falling all over me while I'm doing this.
111:34:30|T|LMP(EVA)|All that soot, huh?
111:34:36|T|CDR(EVA)|That's what it looks like down here.
111:34:43|T|LMP(EVA)|I think my watch stopped, Neil.
111:34:47|T|CDR(EVA)|Did it?
111:35:01|T|LMP(EVA)|No, it didn't either. Second hand.
111:35:12|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. If you can just kind of hold it, why, I think I can do the pulling.
111:35:16|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. Stand by a minute. Let me move back.
111:35:40|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. Easy. All right, easy in the hatch now.
111:35:51|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. I'll get it the rest of the way. And I'll give it to you to - No, wait, just a second. Yes, a little more.
111:36:32|T|CDR(EVA)|Buzz?
111:36:33|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay. It's unhooked.
111:36:39|T|CDR(EVA)|How about that - package out of your - brief. Get that?
111:36:54|T|LMP(EVA)|No.
111:36:56|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay. I'll get it when I get up there.
111:37:02|T|LMP(EVA)|... now?
111:37:04|T|CDR(EVA)|...
111:37:12|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay?
111:37:13|T|LMP(EVA)|Okay.
111:37:30|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Did you get the Hasselblad magazine?
111:37:35|T|CDR(EVA)|Yes, I did. And we got about, I'd say, 20 pounds of carefully selected, if not documented, samples.
111:37:46|T|CC|Houston. Roger. Well done. Out.
111:37:47|T|CDR(EVA)|...
111:38:08|T|LMP(EVA)|Just keep your head down close. Now start arching your back. That's good. Plenty of room. Now, all right, arch your back a little, your head up against *** Roll right just a little bit. Head down. ... in good shape.
111:38:26|T|CDR(EVA)|Thank you. Am I bumping now?
111:38:33|T|LMP(EVA)|No, you're clear. You're rubbing up against me a little bit.
111:38:36|T|CDR(EVA)|Okay?
111:38:38|T|LMP(EVA)|*** All right. That's right. A bit to the left. Okay. Now move your foot, and I'll get the hatch.
111:38:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
111:39:00|P|PAO|Cabin pressure coming up about 2. 789 pounds. Up to 3 now. 4 psi.
111:39:00|P|PAO|We assure the cabin at 4.8 now.
111:39:13|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. The hatch is closed and latched, and verified secure.
111:39:25|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Now we turn the feedwater valve - CLOSED. And I got your PLSS antenna ...
111:39:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Feedwater valve's CLOSED.
111:40:02|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And your antenna's ...
111:40:16|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
111:40:20|T|LMP(TRANQ)|...

111:40:49|T|LMP(TRANQ)|***
111:40:54|T|CC|You're cutting out, Neil. You're not readable. I understand you said something about contingency sample container on the ascent engine?
111:41:11|T|CC|We are not reading you, Neil. Buzz, Buzz, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
111:41:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|***
111:41:28|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. We're reading neither one of you, but standing by.
111:42:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 19
111:44:00|P|PAO|The LM's systems look good. Crewmen should now be transferring back to Tranquility Bases environmental control system and later we'll switch to the vehicles communications system. We estimate it will be another 10 to 15 minutes before their on the LM communication system.
111:49:00|P|PAO|And the replica of the American flag on the lunar surface is now being erected here in the Control Center. And a replica of the plaque on the Tranquility Base has been hung on the wall.

111:53:38|T|CC|This is Houston. I copy a transmission calling Houston; all else was broken up. Over.
111:54:12|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. If you read, we suggest you unstow one PLSS antenna so we can have communications. Over.
111:56:08|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay *** read?
111:56:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|A, receive. B, off.
111:56:25|T|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We seem to be reading you now. How do,you read us? Over.
111:56:30|T|CDR(TRANQ)|ICS, push to talk.
111:56:44|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, this is Tranquility. How do you read?
111:56:47|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Loud and clear. How us?
111:56:53|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Loud and clear. We're in the process of switching over to LM COMM here.
111:56:56|T|CC|Roger.
111:59:41|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. We'd like to verify your steerable antenna in track mode slew. We're going to do a communications handover here on Earth. Over.
111:59:56|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. That's affirmative. We're in track mode slew.
112:00:00|T|CC|Roger. Out.
112:05:58|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia on ... How do you read?
112:06:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Dr. Charles Berry reports that heart rates during this EVA period ranged from a low of 90 for both crewmen to a high of about 125 for Buzz Aldrin at 2 periods. And, a high of 160 for Neil Armstrong at 3 periods. That top reading coming during the time he was transferring the rock boxes into the LM. Dr. Berry says the data they got indicates Neil Armstrong was working very hard at that time.
112:06:06|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
112:06:10|O|CMP|Roger; Columbia OMNI Charlie. How do you read?
112:06:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Columbia on C Charlie. How do you read?
112:06:16|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Reading you loud and clear on OMNI Charlie. The crew of Tranquility Base is back inside their base, repressurized, and they're in the process of doffing the PLSS's. Everything went beautifully. Over.
112:06:34|O|CMP|Hallelujah.
112:06:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Hallelujah.
112:06:38|T|CC|And we'd like to get P00 and ACCEPT from you. We have a state vector uplink. And, after that, we'd like you to realign your platform to the new REFSMMAT that we sent up a REV or two ago. Over.
112:06:57|O|CMP|Roger, understand. You want a option 1 - P52, option 1?
112:06:59|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Understand. You want a option 1, P52 option 1.
112:08:53|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. We're going to uplink you a new state vector, and then we'll send the REFSMMAT up again, because sending the state vector up will wipe out the one that you have onboard; and then you can do a P52 option 1. Over.
112:09:09|O|CMP|P52.
112:09:11|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|P52.
112:14:44|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
112:14:51|O|CMP|Roger, Houston. Columbia's reading you.
112:14:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Houston. Columbia's reading you.
112:14:56|T|CC|Okay, Columbia. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours. You can go BLOCK; however, we'd like you to hold off on the P52 option 1 align until after you've passed landing site 2; and we're requesting that you perform another P22 and attempt to find the LM this pass. I've got some numbers for you when you're ready to copy. Over.
112:15:20|O|CMP|Roger. Stand by.
112:15:22|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Stand by.
112:15:46|O|CMP|Ready to copy.
112:15:49|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
112:15:51|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. P22 landmark ID is lunar module - make that Tranquility Base; P1, 112 25 08; P2, 112 30 17, 4 nautical miles south. Time of closest approach, 112 31 52; shaft 357. 051, trunnion 047. 432, roll zero, pitch 250, yaw zero. Readback. Over.
112:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 19 minutes. The inhabitants of Tranquility Base are still in the post EVA clean up period. Still have not fully configured the voice communications, however, we are getting telemetry - good telemetry from Tranquility Base showing a cabin pressure of 5 pounds per square inch, temperature of 60 degrees. We expect to establish communications before too long. During this period the crew is removing the portable life support systems, checking over their spacecrafts systems, getting ready for jettisoning equipment from Tranquility Base. The cabin will be depressurized before too long and equipment will be jettisoned onto the lunar surface.
112:17:06|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy my P22 update? Over.
112:17:37|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia.
112:17:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.
112:17:45|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy my P22 PAD?
112:18:03|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Do you copy my PAD? Over.
112:18:07|O|CMP|Negative, Bruce. Just give me your latitude - longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares. Never mind the other; you're broken up.
112:18:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Negative, Bruce. Just give me the latitude and longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares. Never mind the other. You're broken up.
112:18:21|T|CC|Stand by.
112:18:28|O|CMP|Well, that is, if you have the new information; otherwise, I'll just use the old numbers.
112:18:30|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Well, that is, if you have new information. Otherwise, I'll just use the old numbers.
112:18:34|T|CC|No, wait a minute. We've got new information.
112:18:37|O|CMP|Okay.
112:18:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
112:20:42|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Can you give us some idea of how you're progressing on the PLSS doffing and preparation for DEPRESS?
112:20:56|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger, Houston. Tranquility Base. We're in the process of using up what film we have, and I'm just getting ready to change the primary ECS canister. Over.
112:21:14|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the DEPRESS, if you can. Over.
112:21:31|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.
112:21:56|T|CC|Roger. That sounds fine to us.
112:22:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Well, it'll be a little crowded in here for a while.
112:22:06|T|CC|Well, we don't mind a bit.
112:22:17|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?
112:22:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?
112:22:27|T|CC|Columbia. This is Houston. Go ahead.
112:22:31|O|CMP|Roger. Have you got the new coordinates for me?
112:22:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Have you got the new coordinates for me?
112:22:37|T|CC|Roger. Latitude 00.691 - that would be plus 00.691 - and longitude over 2 is plus 11.713. The altitude is minus 1.44 nautical miles. Over.
112:23:13|O|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
112:23:15|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Thank you.
112:23:31|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. On latitude, make that plus 00.692, rounding off. Over.
112:23:43|O|CMP|Okay.
112:23:45|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
112:23:56|O|CMP|Okay. I read back plus 00692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?
112:23:59|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. I read back plus 00.692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?
112:24:10|T|CC|Roger. Standby.
112:24:25|T|CC|Columbia. This is Houston. Grid coordinates: Kilo 0.9, 6.3, on LAM 2. Over.
112:24:36|O|CMP|Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.
112:24:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.
112:24:48|T|CC|Roger.
112:25:22|T|CC|And for your information, Columbia, you're approaching the VHF line of site COMM limit with Tranquility Base. LOS will be at 38 minutes plus 25 seconds. Over.
112:25:38|O|CMP|Roger.
112:25:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger.
112:25:42|T|CC|Roger. And we've had to disable the one way MSFN relay owing to a ground site reconfiguration down here. Over.
112:25:51|O|CMP|Okay.
112:25:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
112:33:57|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia ...
112:33:59|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. ...
112:34:06|T|CC|This is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
112:34:10|O|CMP|Roger. I can't see them.
112:34:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I can't see them.
112:34:17|T|CC|Roger. I guess that takes care of the news for today, Mike.
112:34:21|O|CMP|Roger. ...
112:34:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|All right. Roger.
112:34:29|T|CC|You might be interested in knowing, Mike, that we have gotten reflections back from the laser reflector ray they deployed, and we may be able to get some information out of that a little later.
112:34:43|O|CMP|Roger. I need a very precise position because I can only do a decent Job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.
112:34:45|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I need a very precise position, because I can only do a decent job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.
112:35:00|T|CC|Roger. We understand. This is intended to be your last P22. We don't want to use up too much fuel in this effort. Over.
112:35:10|O|CMP|Roger. How's the fuel coming?
112:35:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. How's the fuel coming?
112:35:18|T|CC|Roger. There's no problem fuel wise. It's just that there seems to be a limit to the number of P22's and the number of grid squares you can search over.
112:35:29|O|CMP|Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a ...
112:35:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a sleep ...
112:35:48|T|CC|Roger. That's fine with us. And P52 in that attitude.
112:35:59|T|CC|Roger. A P52 and then the sleep attitude.
112:43:46|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
112:43:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base. Go ahead.
112:43:55|T|CC|Roger. When you all have a free moment, I have your T8 through T12 block data. Over.
112:44:08|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Stand by one.
112:45:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base. Ready to copy.

112:46:45|T|CC|Readback correct. Houston out.
112:47:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston. Columbia.
112:47:49|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia on high-gain.
112:47:50|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base.
112:47:54|T|CC|Columbia. Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
112:48:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia in the high-gain.
112:48:06|T|CC|Roger. Reading you loud and clear on the high-gain, Columbia.
112:48:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Going to P52 attitude. You want a crew status report?
112:48:21|T|CC|Say again, Columbia?
112:48:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I say again, I am maneuvering to the P52 attitude, and do you want a crew status report?
112:48:34|T|CC|Roger. And go ahead with your crew status report.
112:48:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. No medication. Radiation 100.16.
112:48:46|T|CC|Houston. We copy.
112:49:15|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base.
112:49:17|T|CC|Go ahead, Tranquility.
112:49:23|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. The weight of the RCU was 12 ounces. That was by itself without the bag, and the weight of the water from the CDR's PLSS was 12 1/2 ounces. That's reading zero with the bag on.
112:49:53|T|CC|This is Houston. We copy. And, for your information, the new LM weight after jettison of equipment including lithium hydroxide canister is 10837. Over.
112:50:11|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. 10837.
112:53:16|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Did you copy the P52?
112:53:30|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Affirmative.
112:53:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
112:55:05|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In the Flight Plan configuration, we show that the stability control circuit breaker ATCA on panel 16 should be open at this time. Over.
112:55:49|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. Say again which one should be closed?
112:55:54|T|CC|Roger. Panel 16, row 2, STAB control ATCA, that is A T C A, and it should be open at this time. Over.
112:56:06|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Coming open.
112:56:12|T|CC|Roger. Out.
112:56:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Housquin - Houston, Tranquility. Do you have a way of showing the configuration of the engine arm circuit breaker? Over. The reason I'm asking is because the end of it appears to be broken off. I think we can push it back in again. I'm not sure we could pull it out if we pushed it in, though. Over.
112:56:56|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Stand by please.
112:57:21|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Our telemetry shows the engine arm circuit breaker in the OPEN position at the present time. We want you to leave it open until it is nominally scheduled to be pushed in, which is later on. Over.
112:57:41|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy.
112:58:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Dr. Berry reports those dosimeter readings have not changed since yesterday afternoon indicating that the crew was not subjected to radiation on the surface of the Moon or if any a very negligible amount.
112:59:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base. The CDR's PRD reads 11014.
112:59:51|T|CC|Roger. 11014 for the CDR.
113:00:01|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. LMP reads 09018. Over.
113:00:06|T|CC|Roger. 09018.
113:04:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
113:04:43|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead.
113:04:48|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Bruce. When you get a few minutes could you give me some words on tomorrow's activities - when they're going to start?
113:04:57|T|CC|Roger.
113:09:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control - -
113:11:45|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
113:11:57|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
113:12:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
113:12:05|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Couple of quick Flight Plan update here. First off, we'd like to get an O2 fuel cell purge at time 113 30. You - Are you copying? Over.
113:12:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. And copy.
113:12:26|T|CC|Secondly, we will return to the nominal timeline with your scheduled wakeup of 121 hours and 12 minutes. We sort of slipped by lithium hydroxide canister change number 9 during the EVA and EVA PREP. We'd like you to accomplish that now. The COMM for sleep will be the normal lunar COMM configuration, the RCS configuration. We're requesting you use quads Alfa and Bravo. A DAP data load for R2 should be 01111. Readback. Over.
113:13:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Oxygen fuel cell purge at 113 30. Return to the nominal timeline at 121 hours wakeup. Lithium hydroxide change number 9 right now. Normal lunar COMM sleep configuration, I'm in that now. On the RCS, I understood before you wanted to load the DAP register 2 011000 which made sense, and then later to pitch only on quad A, enable all on quad B, and C and D off. But you don't want to do that any more, huh?
113:15:20|T|CC|Columbia. This is Houston. On your DAP load in R2, we're requesting a 0 an four 1's, that is, 01111. Over
113:15:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
113:15:38|T|CC|And you - -
113:15:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Load's going in right now.
113:15:41|T|CC|Roger. And you'll be enabling quads Alfa and Bravo on the AUTO RCS select switches. Disable Charlie and Delta.
113:15:51|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|All right.
113:15:59|T|CC|And we have a little less than 2 minutes to LOS. If you're still up, AOS next time around will be 114 04. Over.
113:16:18|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger.
113:16:27|T|CC|And, Columbia, if it's agreeable with you, we'd like you to stay awake until we have one successful reacquisition on the high-gain antenna. And I guess you can plan on turning in shortly after AOS this next pass. Over.
113:16:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
113:16:49|T|CC|Roger. Out.
113:17:34|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
113:17:42|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead. Houston.
113:17:44|T|CC|Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Just wanted to make sure we still had COMM.
113:17:52|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. We just finished up - we're just finishing up our eat period. Be ready to go back into PREP for DEPRESS.
113:17:59|T|CC|Roger.
113:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 113 hours, 18 minutes. We have had loss of signal from Columbia. We have asked Mike Collins to stay awake through acquisition on the next rev which will be number 20 so that we can check the automatic acquisition mode of the high-gain antenna. Once we've verified that, he will start his rest period. The planned wake up for Command Module Pilot 121 hours.
113:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control. We're estimating the change-of-shift news briefing for 2:00AM Central Daylight Time. 2:00AM Central Daylight Time for the change-of-shift briefing.
113:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 29 minutes. The change-of-shift news briefing is about to start. We will take any air-ground transmissions during this period for playback after the briefing. If the equipment jettison occurs during the briefing, we will come back up and provide that for you live.
113:39:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 20
113:46:23|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
113:46:29|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
113:46:32|T|CC|Roger. On your next depressurization, it's acceptable to use the overhead hatch dump valve in addition to or instead of the forward hatch dump valve to speed up the depressurization of the cabin. I have a T13 update for you, and if you could, sometime here, give us P00 and DATA; we'll uplink you a new CSM state vector. Over.
113:47:04|T|CDR(TRANQ)|All right.
113:47:19|T|LMP(TRANQ)|You've got the DSKY.
113:47:22|T|CC|Roger. Your T13 time is 124 22 02. Over.
113:47:40|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. It's T13, 124 22 - is that 02? Over.
113:47:49|T|CC|That's affirmative. That is 02. And do you have a time estimate for us until you're ready to start cabin DEPRESS? Over.
113:48:05|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Fifteen minutes, maybe?
113:48:10|T|CC|Roger.
113:50:30|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Uplink complete. The computer's yours, and you can go out of DATA.
113:50:39|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
113:59:50|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
113:59:59|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead. Tranquility Base, here.
114:00:02|T|CC|Roger. Just want to let you guys know that since you're an hour and a half over your timeline and we're all taking a day off tomorrow, we're going to leave you. See you later.
114:00:13|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I don't blame you a bit.
114:00:16|T|CC|That's a real great day, guys. I really enjoyed it.
114:00:23|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Thank you. You couldn't have enjoyed it as much as we did.
114:00:26|T|CC|Roger.
114:00:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It was great.
114:00:30|T|CC|Sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash out out of there, though.
114:00:34|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Yes. We're just about to do it.
114:00:36|T|CC|Okay.
114:01:00|P|PAO|- hours one minute. We have about 2 minutes worth of tape. We'll play that for you now.
114:01:00|P|PAO|We're live now. The Capcom voice on that last transmission was Deke Slayton, the director of Flight Crew Operations here at MSC.
114:01:00|P|PAO|We said good night to Mike Collins and Columbia at 114 hours 6 minutes. And the cabin is coming down now on Tranquility Base. And it's down to about three and a half pounds now and holding that.
114:01:00|P|PAO|The Tranquility Base pressure coming on down now, one and a half pounds.
114:01:00|P|PAO|Less than half a pound of pressure now.
114:04:27|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. We show the suit relief valve still in the AUTO position. It should be closed. Over.
114:05:19|T|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
114:05:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Go ahead.
114:05:35|T|CC|Roger. We've successfully reacquired high-gain antenna. Unless you have some other traffic with us, I guess we'll bid you a good night and let you get some sleep, Mike. Over.
114:05:48|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Sounds fine.
114:05:50|T|CC|And we're going to power down the voice subcarrier part of our uplink to you in order that we don't disturb you while we're talking to Tranquility Base. If you need us, just give us a call, and we can respond with a time lag of about a minute to a minute and a half in setting reconfigured. Over.
114:06:13|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you.
114:06:15|T|CC|Roger. And good night.
114:06:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Good night, Bruce. Thanks a lot.
114:09:23|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to ENABLE the thrusters in Bravo 1 and Bravo 2, AUTO RCS SELECT. Over.
114:09:46|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Bravo 1 and Bravo 2 ENABLE.
114:09:49|T|CC|Roger. Out.
114:10:18|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. For a reference, which dump valve are you using? Over.
114:10:28|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We used the forward dump valve until about 2 psi, and we're using the overhead now.
114:10:34|T|CC|Roger. Out.
114:10:37|T|CDR(TRANQ)|They're both - they're both open now.
114:11:00|P|PAO|Unofficial time for start of this second depressurization 114 hours, 8 minutes, 12 seconds. Suit pressur2 is holding at about 3.9 pounds per square inch. The cabin pressure down to about a tenth of a pound now. .04 pounds now. There went something. Looked like a portable life support system. Here comes the other PLSS. Cabin is being repressurized now. The experiments console reports the seismometer recorded both the impacts of those portable life support systems. Cabin pressure up over 1 psi. Up to 2 now. 3 pounds per square inch. 4 pounds. Leveling off to about 4.8.
114:11:00|P|PAO|Items scheduled to be jettisoned were the two portable life support systems, the lithium hydroxide canister, and the arm rests from the LM. We expect the crew to turn off the TV very shortly switching over to the -
114:18:27|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base. REPRESS complete.
114:18:31|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We observed your equipment jettison on the TV, and the passive seismic experiment recorded shocks when each PLSS hit the surface. Over.
114:18:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|You can't get away with anything anymore, can you?
114:18:51|T|CC|No, indeed.
114:21:00|P|PAO|Switching over to another telemetry mode when they turn off the TV switch.
114:21:00|P|PAO|And the TV went off at 114 hours 25 minutes 47 seconds.
114:21:28|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
114:21:34|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
114:21:36|T|CC|Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.
114:22:20|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy.
114:22:23|T|CC|And of course, when you get ready to turn in, go back into caution and warning, ENABLE, and we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries and in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today. Over.
114:22:46|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Thank you very much.
114:22:48|T|LMP(TRANQ)|It's been a long day.
114:22:51|T|CC|Yes, indeed. Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.
114:24:06|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. Did you all come up with any other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? Over.
114:24:27|T|CC|Stand by, Tranquility. We'll be back with you in just a minute.
114:25:29|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And, Houston, Tranquility. Have you had enough TV for today?
114:25:34|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.
114:25:43|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Signing off. See you again tomorrow.
114:25:46|T|CC|Roger.
114:26:53|T|CC|Columbia, Colunbia, this is Houston. Over.
114:27:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead, Houston.
114:27:02|T|CC|Roger. Sorry to bother you, Columbia. Two things: we request that you select 10 degree deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9 7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.
114:27:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
114:27:42|T|CC|Roger. Goodnight again.
114:28:09|T|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
114:28:16|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead.
114:28:19|T|CC|Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.
114:29:04|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. We'll try it.
114:29:55|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC   LGC, I mean?
114:30:23|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. I'll give you a time hack at 114 31 00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over.
114:30:51|T|CC|Stand by for a Mark at 114 31.
114:30:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. ... you.
114:30:57|T|CC|Stand by.
114:31:00|T|CC|MARK.
114:31:14|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you copy my Mark at 114 31?
114:31:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Thank you, and our mission timer is running now.
114:31:27|T|CC|Roger. Very good. And, I've got a consumables update for you if you're ready to copy or listen. Over.
114:31:38|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Stand by.
114:31:43|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Go ahead.
114:31:45|T|CC|Okay. RCS Alfa is 81 percent, RCS Bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115 hours GET, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. Over.
114:32:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.
114:32:32|T|CC|Roger. Out.
114:33:06|T|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.
114:33:35|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I guess we can take them up now.
114:33:39|T|CC|Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.
114:33:52|T|CC|Tranquility - -
114:33:53|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.
114:33:59|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preFlight Plan. Over.
114:34:16|T|LMP(TRANQ)|We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.
114:34:31|T|CC|Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.
114:35:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.
114:35:22|T|CC|Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.
114:35:37|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.
114:36:06|T|CC|Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.
114:36:40|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.
114:37:09|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.
114:37:42|T|LMP(TRANQ)|The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.
114:38:24|T|CC|Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?
114:38:49|T|LMP(TRANQ)|No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.
114:39:48|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -
114:40:01|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I believe so.
114:40:02|T|CC|Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.
114:40:19|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.
114:41:06|T|CC|Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over
114:41:27|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.
114:42:00|P|PAO|The Capcom there was astronaut Owen Garrett, one of the group of five scientists astronauts selected in 1965.
114:42:22|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?
114:42:59|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.
114:43:23|T|CC|Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.
114:44:01|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?
114:44:08|T|CC|Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.
114:44:31|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?
114:44:52|T|CC|Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.
114:45:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.
114:45:46|T|CC|Roger. I - -
114:45:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.
114:45:50|T|CC|Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.
114:46:25|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.
114:46:45|T|CC|Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.
114:46:56|T|CDR(TRANQ)|That's correct.
114:46:58|T|CC|Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.
114:47:12|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Thank you.
114:49:01|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.
114:49:14|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Will do.
114:52:00|P|PAO|Tranquility Base has confirmed that they left on the lunar surface all the items they had planned to. We have said good night to Neil Armstrong and Buz Aldrin. We will continue to monitor throughout this rest period which is scheduled to end at about 122 hours elapsed time. We're now 114 hours 53 minutes. Should there be any further conversations with either Tranquility Base or Columbia, we will come back up and bring those to you. This is Mission Control, Houston.
114:52:18|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
114:52:27|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
114:52:28|T|CC|Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the Flight Plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.
114:52:48|T|LMP(TRANQ)|That's - All that's verified.
114:52:51|T|CC|Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.
114:52:57|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay.
115:37:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 21
115:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 50 minutes. It's been almost an hour since we said good night to Tranquility Base. Dr. Kenneth Biers, the Flight Surgeon on this shift, reports that he does not believe that Neil Armstrong is asleep yet. From his heart rate, he thinks he's resting and perhaps dozing from time to time, but he doesn't believe that he is asleep. Neil is the only one being monitored in Tranquility Base. There is no biomedical instrumentation for Buzz Aldrin. Dr. Biers reports that Mike Collins is sound asleep in Columbia as it orbits the Moon. Columbia has just entered its 21st revolution of the Moon. All systems on the Lunar Module are in good order, showing cabin pressure of 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin temperature 62 degrees Fahrenheit. We have not heard from Tranquility Base since saying good night and we have not attempted to call them. This is Mission Control, Houston.
116:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 116 hours 50 minutes. All systems in both Columbia and Tranquility Base still operating very well. No problems. Dr. Kenneth Biers' report is the same as the one an hour ago. The data from Neil Armstrong indicates that he is resting, but he is not believed to be asleep, not following the pattern of sleep, but he is resting. Cabin pressure is holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch, temperature at 62 degrees Fahrenheit. The consumables in Tranquility Base are still in good shape, showing 45 and a half per cent of the descent water still remaining, the water very important for cooling on the lunar surface. Showing 63 per cent of the oxygen supply in the Descent Stage still remaining. Both of those consumables in the Ascent Stage very high - have not been used yet. Two water tanks in the Ascent Stage, each one showing 97.6 per cent; the other showing 98.4. Two oxygen tanks in the Ascent Stage, one reading 93 and a half per cent, the other 96.8 per cent. Mike Collins still asleep in Columbia. At 116 hours 52 minutes, all still going well with both spacecrafts. This is Mission Control, Houston.
117:36:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 22
117:54:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 117 hours 54 minutes. All continues to go well with both Columbia orbiting the Moon, now in its 22nd revolution, and Tranquility Base on the surface of the Moon. Flight surgeon Dr. Kenneth Biers says his data continues to indicate that Neil Armstrong may be dozing but he's sure that he is not sleeping soundly or well. Heart rates have been down in the 50's at times, but have not stayed there very long. He believes he may be sleeping fitfully and dozing, but stirring around quite a bit. Mike Collins still sleeping in Columbia and the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin is not instrumented so the doctors cannot determine whether he's asleep or not. Cabin pressure in the Lunar Module still holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch. Temperature has dropped one degree since last report, now reading 61 degrees Fahrenheit. All consumables are still in good shape. This is Mission Control, Houston.
118:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 118 hours 50 minutes. Flight Controllers here in Mission Control Center continue to monitor the systems of Eagle at Tranquility base consistently and of Columbia when that spacecraft is within acquisition on the front side of the Moon. And they are in acquisition of Columbia telemetry now, it's in it's 22 revolution. Everything continuing to go very well. All systems normal. Mike Collins is still alseep, very well, in Columbia. Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully, if indeed he is asleep at all at Tranquility base. Throughout this rest period the cabin pressure has held very steady at 4.9 in the Lunar Module. We're still showing a cabin temperature of 61. This is Mission Control, Houston.

119:51:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 119 hours, 51 minutes. The report is the same as it has been throughout the rest period. All systems in both Eagle and Columbia are operating very well, Mike Collins asleep, Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully. The heart rate goes down into the sleep range but then comes up out of it indicating he is stirring around considerably. Columbia is in its 23rd revolution now in an orbit 62 by 57 nautical miles. Still holding 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin pressure 61 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. The descent water quantity now shows 39 and one-half percent remaining. Descent oxygen quantity 63 percent remaining. This is Mission Control, Houston.
120:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 120 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've called the spacecraft Columbia from Mission Control here to wake up Mike Collins. The network is configured so that the LM crew, the Eagle crew, will not be disturbed. Lets join the conversation in progress.
120:59:04|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.
120:59:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Hi, Ron.
120:59:14|T|CC|Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?
120:59:17|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|How goes it?
120:59:18|T|CC|Hey, real fine. While you're - -
120:59:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I don't know yet, how's it going with you?
120:59:23|T|CC|Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.
120:59:57|T|CC|Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.
121:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft Columbia has gone behind the Moon on the twenty-third lunar revolution. Be acquired again at - well, let's see now, it looks like we don't have acquisition table up yet for next rev. During this pass and the short conversation toward the end of the front side pass with Columbia, the network transmitters have been arranged so that the transmissions would not disturb the crew of Eagle who at this time should be asleep. Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins is experiencing during this 47 minutes of each lunar revolution when he's behind the Moon with no one to talk to except his tape recorder aboard Columbia. While he waits for his comrades to soar with Eagle from Tranquility Base and rejoin him for the trip back to Earth, Collins, with the help of Flight Controllers here in Mission Control Center has kept the Command Module's system going "pocketa-pocketapocketa". At 120 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
121:00:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
121:00:34|T|CC|And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.
121:00:54|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
121:00:56|T|CC|Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.
121:02:04|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.
121:02:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.
121:02:24|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.
121:02:31|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I'd like its grid square, please.
121:02:35|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
121:04:58|T|CC|Columbia, Houston.
121:05:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
121:05:09|T|CC|Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.
121:05:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Ready to copy.
121:05:28|T|CC|Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?
121:05:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes, please.
121:06:00|T|CC|Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.
121:06:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Copy T1: 122 16 05. T2: 122 21 11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.
121:06:51|T|CC|Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.
121:07:05|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|All right.
121:07:06|T|CC|And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.
121:07:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?
121:07:37|T|CC|Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -
121:07:50|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.
121:07:53|T|CC|Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.
121:08:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.
121:08:05|T|CC|And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.
121:08:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?
121:08:35|T|CC|Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.
121:08:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?
121:08:47|T|CC|Roger.
121:08:53|T|CC|And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.
121:08:59|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.
121:09:02|T|CC|Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.
121:09:11|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thanks, Ron.
121:32:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 24
121:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Let's join the call to Tranquility Base.
121:40:36|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
121:40:45|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.
121:40:49|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?
121:41:02|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.
121:41:14|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the Command Module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.
121:42:05|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.
121:42:14|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.
121:42:21|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.
121:42:33|T|CC|Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.
121:42:59|T|CDR(TRANQ)|All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.
121:43:01|T|CC|Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.
121:43:23|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Now you've got P00 and DATA.
121:43:25|T|CC|Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.
121:43:35|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.
121:43:44|T|CC|That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.
121:44:21|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&N dictionary.
121:44:29|T|CC|Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.
121:44:50|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
121:44:51|T|CC|Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE 0VERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.
121:46:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?
121:46:20|T|CC|Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.
121:46:53|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?
121:47:02|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I have those two.
121:47:04|T|CC|Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.
121:47:37|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead then.
121:47:38|T|CC|Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.
121:48:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.
121:48:29|T|CC|Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.
121:49:10|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.
121:49:12|T|CC|Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over
121:49:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.
121:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. A little over 2 minutes until Columbia comes over the hill again on the 24th Lunar Revolution. In that wake up call to Eagle, the crew described how they slept in the spacecraft by lying on the floor and on the engine cover. Some of the preliminary times being generated now ascent show ignition about 1 minute 26 seconds earlier than the pre-mission Flight Plan. Ignition time now showing 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds. Burn will have a magnitude of 6,068 feet per second. Quite a bit of that will be in vertical rise and actually starting from zero feet per second on the lunar surface. The CSI maneuver behind the Moon, the Concentric Sequence Initiate, CSI the acronym being for that maneuver. 125 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds. Consistent Delta height CDH 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds. Terminal Phase initiation 126 hours 57 minutes 0 seconds, and Terminal Phase Finalization or the final breaking before docking 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. These are Ground computations. And they will be computed by the crew from radar tracking, rendezvous radar. So actually these number computed on the Ground are somewhat academic in that they will be computed in real time by the crew. We're standing by here for Capcom to resume conversation. During this up coming pass here, more definite fix on the Eagle positions will be attempted by using the rendezvous radar from the Eagle in Program 22, rendezvous radar lunar surface navigation program. The transponder on Columbia in the meantime has been warmed up. During the last revolution, Mike Collins was advised to - have the - the transponder warmed up. As of now, the exact location is somewhat vague. And perhaps this rendezvous radar exercise will give a final, more pinpoint location of where Eagle does indeed nest on the Moon. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit. We've had acquisition of signal with Columbia, so likely the conversation will increase here as we get the
121:50:01|T|CC|Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.
121:50:35|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. We'll put it in AGS.
121:50:40|T|CC|Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.
121:50:49|T|CC|Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.
121:51:08|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.
121:51:21|T|CC|Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.
121:52:29|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. I think I have that.
121:58:18|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
121:59:17|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
121:59:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia.

121:59:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|In work.
121:59:48|T|CC|Roger. And do you have any torquing angles from the P52?

122:00:12|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Request ERROR RESET at this time. Over.
122:00:21|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. ERROR RESET, and would you tell me when you're satisfied with the LGC self test?
122:00:30|T|CC|Tranquility, LGC is a GO.
122:00:36|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
122:00:39|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Torquing angles when you're ready.
122:00:41|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Go ahead.
122:00:51|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Stars 25 and 42; angle difference 5 balls; NOUN 93, plus 00165, plus 00186, minus 00039, time of torquing 121 15. Over.
122:01:12|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We copy. Thank you.

122:05:47|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston, We copy. Stand by one.
122:05:55|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Request recycle.
122:11:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. My rendezvous radar transponder is operating.
122:11:52|T|CC|Spacecraft calling Houston? Say again.
122:11:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|This is Columbia saying the rendezvous radar transponder is operating.
122:12:02|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Columbia.
122:13:56|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Request rendezvous radar breakers in about now.
122:14:33|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Request OMNI D - OMNI Delta.
122:15:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation of radar lock on.
122:15:47|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Request you go ahead and start the warmup on the rendezvous radar.
122:15:56|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
122:16:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, you copying NOUN 93?
122:17:01|T|CC|Tranquility, affirmative. Go.
122:17:07|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. We're going to a torque.
122:17:10|T|CC|Houston. Roger.
122:18:00|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Columbia will be overhead at 122 plus 22 plus 51. His LOS will be 29 35. Over.
122:18:21|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
122:20:35|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, we'd like to check this on the tape meter against the AGS. We'll go back to altitude - altitude rates as soon as the rate starts to build up. Over.
122:20:50|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger.
122:21:03|T|CDR(TRANQ)|On second thought, since that will peg the range rate, I guess maybe we'd better not do that. And for this range that the AGS are showing now, 425 miles with a signal strength of 2.2. It looks like we ought to proceed on this. Over.
122:21:31|T|CC|Roger. Stand by one. Tranquility, affirmative. Proceed.
122:21:56|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Are you getting the information on the downlink now?
122:22:04|T|CC|Tranquility, affirmative, and we're saving it. We've got 4 so far, and it's looking good.
122:22:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay. What do you people think about calling up a VERB 83?
122:22:41|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Stand by on that now. We're getting the data now. We're checking on the VERB 83.
122:22:50|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And we expect that we may lose lock when it passes overhead because of the MAX rate that the radar has.
122:23:05|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Negative on VERB 83.
122:23:11|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Understand.
122:24:09|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We just lost lock.
122:24:12|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Go.
122:24:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|They've just lost lock, Ron.
122:24:25|T|CC|Roger. We had about 20 some points before you did that. And for your information, the reason the AGS is a little different there - The reason the AGS is a little different is because the K factor is a little bit wrong.
122:24:40|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Has he already gone? Over. Okay. Okay. Has he already gone overhead, or do you want us to try and get in lock on again?
122:24:51|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. You got NOUN 49. Five good marks.
122:24:57|T|CC|Tranquility, affirmative. Try to lock on again, and you'll lose him at about 29 minutes and 35 seconds.
122:25:09|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Do you have a real quick procedure how to do that?
122:25:21|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Say again about your NOUN 49.
122:25:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I say I got five good marks. You got NOUN 49. When you get everything you need off the downlink, let me know.
122:25:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.
122:25:56|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Ron, did you say on the 526 alarm to proceed or do a VERB 32?
122:26:03|T|CC|Roger. It's just that radar thinks the range is greater than 400 miles now.
122:26:13|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Recommend you terminate P22. Over.
122:26:22|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Will do.
122:26:24|T|CC|And, Columbia, Houston. Same for you. You can terminate P22.
122:26:34|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I have. I'm running fast.
122:26:36|T|CC|Roger.
122:27:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I'm staying in P22 here a second just to record the NOUN 89 and then over VERB 34.
122:27:21|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy, and that's good.
122:27:57|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston.
122:28:07|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead.
122:28:09|T|CC|Roger. Request S BAND FUNCTION switch to RANGE. We're going to do some ranging on you. Also, I have an updated AGS K factor when you are ready to copy. Over.
122:28:24|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead with the K factor.
122:28:27|T|CC|Roger. 119 plus 59 plus 59.92. Over.
122:28:44|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. A little closer this time.
122:28:46|T|CC|Yes. It sure is.
122:28:47|T|LMP(TRANQ)|119 59 5992. Over.
122:28:52|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Readback correct.
122:30:10|T|CC|Columbia, Houston - -
122:30:11|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. I see what you mean now about the K factor.
122:30:15|T|CC|Roger.
122:30:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|This is Columbia. Go ahead. And I'd like to know about this P52 coming up. Is that the one I just completed or do you want a pair of them back to back?
122:30:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You do not need to do another P52 unless you want to. Break. And also, Columbia, when you get a chance, request BATT C and the PYRO readouts. Over.
122:31:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|BATT C says 37 volts even. PYRO A, 37. PYRO B, 37.
122:31:20|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. Thank you.
122:31:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|BATT bus B is 37. BATT bus A is 36, or I'd think the gauge is stuck.
122:31:35|T|CC|Roger. And you're looking good to us - to us, Columbia.
122:31:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes sir. Keep it that way.
122:32:06|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia is coming up on a VERB 45 ENTER to reset the surface flag.
122:32:15|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Negative. Stand by on the VErB 45.
122:32:22|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger that.
122:32:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|And a crew status report from Columbia. I figure I got about 5 hours' good sleep, although you guys probably know better than I do.
122:32:52|T|CC|Columbia. Roger. We copy.
122:33:31|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've got a couple more vectors to send up to you. They'll be coming up shortly and then you can do the VERB 45 after you get those in. Over.
122:33:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to make sure that we're both in SYNC on the order.
122:33:54|T|CC|Roger.
122:35:24|T|CC|Columbia and Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In case you haven't noticed, the MSFN relay is not activated, so I can go ahead and relay anything if you want to talk directly.
122:35:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Roger.
122:35:54|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. Be advised we've got - -
122:35:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|...
122:36:01|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Coming ... on schedule - - showing red right now. We just put a VERB 77 in. I believe that there's ... let me check here.
122:36:20|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We've got a lot of static down here. Could you say again?
122:36:31|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. We have four out of eight circuit breaker talkbacks indicating red. We still have the circuit breakers out as of right now. I believe at this moment we have just entered VERB 77 on tape 3052 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire. Is it normal to have these four red flags? Over.
122:37:09|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We think that's okay. Go ahead and reset them and press on with the hot fire. Over.
122:37:28|T|CC|Roger. They are reset.
122:37:33|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send some state vectors up to you.
122:37:44|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Here we going P00 and ACCEPT.
122:41:58|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. I used Capella in the last sighting, and it's a good ways near the edge. A good ways away from the center of detent 4. I'm wondering if it would pay any to use Alpheratz, star number 1. It might be a little closer. However, it would delay things a little, since I'd have to designate the radar out of the way. Over.
122:42:36|T|CC|Tranquility. Roger. We copy. Stand by 1. And, break, break, Columbia. We're having a little trouble getting the stuff in there. Request high-gain, pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150. Over.
122:43:06|T|CC|And, Tranquility, Houston. We'd prefer to save the time; press on with Capella. Over.
122:43:19|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
122:43:30|T|CC|And, Tranquility, Houston. The RCS check looked mighty fine to us.
122:43:37|T|CDR(TRANQ)|It looks good up here.
122:43:48|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:44:22|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:44:57|T|CC|Columbia, Houston in the blind - high-gain. Pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150.
122:45:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. Could you give me the fixed portion of the ascent PAD so I can load it in for a P57? Over.
122:46:02|T|CC|Tranquility. Roger. Stand by one. We want to wait on that P57 until about TIG minus 50 minutes. Over.
122:46:19|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger.
122:47:03|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:48:30|T|CC|Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:50:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. It turns out that detent 4 isn't usable anyway with the yaw that we have, because the Earth appears in both detent 2 and detent 3.
122:50:39|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Roger.
122:50:54|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:51:22|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. I have your LM ascent and CSI data PAD's when you are ready to copy.
122:51:33|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We're ready to copy.
122:51:36|T|CC|Roger. LM ascent PAD: TIG 124 22 00 00 00 NOUN 76 55349 00322, plus 0017; DEDA 47, plus 37104, minus 70470, plus 58604, plus 56936. Your LM weight 10837. Your T14 126, plus 20, plus 12. Over.
122:53:18|T|CDR(TRANQ)|What figure is the crossrange and NOUN 76?
122:53:26|T|CC|Roger. Your crossrange for NOUN 76 - By the way, we may update this later, but now it is plus 0017. Over.
122:53:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Readback follows. TIG 124 22 0000 55349 00322, plus 0017, plus 37104, minus 70470, plus 58604, plus 56936. LM weight 10837. T14, 126 20 12. Go.
122:54:30|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Your readback correct. Now I have your CSI PAD.
122:54:50|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Going to CSI PAD.
122:54:52|T|CC|Roger. CSI PAD. TIG of CSI 125 19 3470; TIG of TPI 126 57 0000; NOUN 81, 0532 plus 0000; FDAI NA; DEDA 373 03196; DEDA 275 04170; NOUN 86 plus 0532, plus 0000, plus 0012. Tranquility readback.

122:57:10|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Your readback is correct. And, Tranquility, no need for any GYRO compensation. It's GO.
122:57:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand.
122:57:34|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
122:57:48|T|CC|Columbia, Houston in the blind. Request high-gain. Pitch minus 30, yaw plus 170. Over.
122:58:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 5 minutes 35 seconds away from loss of signal with the spacecraft Columbia before it goes on the far side of the Moon on the 24th revolution. 1 hour, 18 minutes until ascent ignition and following that the rendezvous sequence completed with the docking at 128 hours approximately. We'll continue to monitor air to ground here as data is passed up to the crew for the upcoming day's activities. Apollo Control standing by at 123 hours and 3 minutes.
122:58:35|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia on the high-gain. Over.
122:58:38|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. We still need to finish your uplink there, and then I have your CSI and TPI times and also the lift off.
122:58:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead. Ready to copy.
122:58:57|T|CC|Roger. LM ascent lift off time: 124 22 0000. Your CSI TIG, say again CSI TIG: 125 19 3470. Your TIG of TPI: 126 57 0000. And the LM's NOUN 81 values for CSI: 0532 - that's 53.2 for DELTA VX, DELTA VY all zeros. Columbia, Houston. Over.
123:00:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I readback lift off TIG 124 22 even, CSI 125 19 3470, TPI 126 57 even, the LM's NOUN 81 for CSI 53.2 DELTA VX. Over.
123:00:35|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. Your readback correct.
123:01:00|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We're coming up with your second load now.
123:01:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger that.
123:01:49|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours, and you can do your VERB 45 ENTER now.
123:01:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Go into BLOCK and VERB 45 ENTER.
123:02:02|T|CC|Roger.
123:02:11|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|How's the Black Team today? All primed and raring to go?
123:02:14|T|CC|You bet you there, Mike.
123:02:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Good signal.
123:05:43|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. About 3 minutes to LOS, and I have your consumables update.
123:05:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
123:05:53|T|CC|Roger. At 123 plus 00, RCS total minus 7 percent, Alfa minus 12 percent, Bravo plus 4.5, Charlie minus 7, Delta minus 6.5. Your hydrogen total minus 1.4 pounds, oxygen - oxygen plus 1.7. Over.
123:06:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Whoever figured those hydrogens and oxygens out a couple of days ago must have known what he was doing.
123:06:46|T|CC|Okay. I think I read that oxygen - it's a plus 17 pounds.
123:06:54|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Still close.
123:06:56|T|CC|Roger.
123:07:52|T|CC|Eagle and Columbia, this is the backup crew. Our congratulations for yesterday's performance, and our prayers are with you for the rendezvous. Over.
123:08:00|O|CDR|Thank you kindly, Jim.
123:08:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal with Columbia going behind the Moon. Toward the end of that pass, Apollo 11 backup commander, Jim Lovell, who's had some experience in Lunar missions came up with his congratulations with his job-well-done. He mentioned that he would be here giving moral support during the rendezvous sequence to follow. There are likely to be further communications with Eagle until the Command Module comes around the corner again some 44 minutes from now We'll bring the circuit back up as communications resume perhaps playing catch up with tape recordings, and at 123 hours, 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, 1 hour, 11 minutes to ignition this is Apollo - stand by. We may be - let's listen in again.
123:08:04|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Thank you, Jim.
123:08:06|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Thank you, Jim.
123:08:06|O|CDR|Glad to have all you big roomful of people looking over our shoulder.
123:08:10|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Glad to have all you big room full of people looking over our shoulder.
123:08:15|T|CDR(TRANQ)|We had a lot of help down there, Jim.
123:10:32|T|CDR(TRANQ)|And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.
123:12:55|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.
123:13:05|T|CDR(TRANQ)|I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.
123:14:16|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.
123:14:32|T|CC|And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S band function switch to OFF RESET.
123:14:42|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger.
123:14:45|T|CC|And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.
123:14:53|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Ready to copy.
123:14:55|T|CC|Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O2 is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.
123:15:41|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy. Sounds very good. Thank you.
123:15:44|T|CC|Roger.
123:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 57 minutes 22 seconds away from ignition on the LM ascent back into lunar orbit. Some 30 minutes away from acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia, as it comes around again on the 25th revolution. And the latest information from the scientific experiment placed on the lunar surface last night by the Apollo 11 crew, our Science Support Room reports receiving continuous data from the Passive Seismic Experiment. The Passive Seismic Experiment is part of the early Apollo science experiment package which has the acronym ASEP. Recorded the astronauts footsteps on the Moon; also sent down signals when the crew climbed up the ladder back into the Eagle, and recorded a strong signal when they expended Portable Life Support
123:18:00|P|PAO|Backpacks and other pieces of equipment were jettisoned out Eagle's front hatch. Let's rejoin the conversation.
123:18:35|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
123:18:41|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead, Houston.
123:18:43|T|CC|Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.
123:19:08|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.
123:19:37|T|CC|Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.
123:20:43|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.
123:20:54|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.
123:21:00|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
123:21:05|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.
123:21:15|T|CC|Roger.
123:21:33|T|CDR(TRANQ)|And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did retract.
123:21:37|T|CC|Roger. Mighty fine. Thank you.
123:22:45|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston.
123:22:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead.
123:22:54|T|CC|Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.
123:23:10|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?
123:23:14|T|CC|Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.
123:23:36|T|LMP(TRANQ)|On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.
123:23:44|T|CC|Roger. That's fine then.
123:25:43|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. I have one more late checklist change there on the rendezvous radar position for lift off. Over. From page Surface 57.
123:26:00|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead.
123:26:01|T|CC|Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.
123:26:25|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.
123:26:29|T|CC|Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.
123:26:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Copy.
123:27:10|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.
123:27:25|T|CC|Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.
123:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in mission Control Center Flight Director Glen Lunney is polling the various positions here in the Control Room on their readiness to go ahead with the ascent from this next pass as the Command Module comes around the Moon, and we're some 53 minutes now away from ascent. Meanwhile back at the scientific experiment situation, another attempt is scheduled today to shoot another laser beam up to the laser retro-reflector, which is the other part of the experiment package left on the Moon. The seismic experiment will continue to record and send back measurements to Mission Control and will probably receive it's strongest signal when the ascent engine ignites and starts Eagle on it's way into lunar orbit and rendezvous with Columbia. There's considerable amount of conversation going on with the crew even though Command Module Columbia is behind the Moon at this time. Rather than disconnect the air-ground line and be in a tape play-back mode, we'll leave a circuit up all the way through to loss of signal on the next rev when both spacecraft will go behind the Moon. At 123 hours, 29 minutes, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
123:30:41|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
123:30:46|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead.
123:30:48|T|CC|Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a planes change, but the - In the worst case, it would be up to 30 feet per second. And, of course, we don't expect that at all.
123:31:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 25
123:31:15|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
123:31:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on this 604.
123:31:38|T|CC|Tranquility. Roger. That's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is this correct?
123:31:52|T|LMP(TRANQ)|We have one primary canister onboard and one secondary. The other primary is - out in front of the Z - plus - Z pad. Over.
123:32:06|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Thank you.
123:33:41|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Ready for the blue bag - -
123:33:44|T|LMP(TRANQ)|The PGNS looks consistent today.
123:33:47|T|CC|Hey, that's affirmative, by gosh. Looking great.
123:44:15|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, did you copy NOUN 05, and are you looking at 93? Over.
123:44:21|T|CC|Tranquility Base. It's beautiful.
123:44:28|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. We'll proceed.
123:44:31|T|CC|Roger.
123:44:35|T|LMP(TRANQ)|I know where the star is; I'm not sure the PGNS knows where gravity is.
123:44:39|T|CC|Okay.
123:48:04|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Houston, these are your angles, not ours.
123:48:12|T|CC|Roger, Tranquility.
123:48:13|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Stand by for some change or modification in the angles.
123:48:23|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Recommend 334, and that should just keep it out of the limit.
123:48:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay.
123:55:17|O|CMP|Houston, Columbia on OMNI D, Delta. Over.
123:55:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia on OMNI D Delta. Over.
123:55:23|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. Loud and clear. And if you would like to take it down, we have the latest position of Tranquility Base. Over.
123:55:33|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead.
123:55:33|O|CMP|Go ahead.
123:55:36|T|CC|Roger. It's just west - at west crater, Juliett 0.5, 7.7. Over.
123:55:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Understand that it is just west of the crater Juliett 0.5 and 7.7. Is that correct?
123:56:01|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. That is correct.
123:56:06|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Thank you, Ron.
123:56:15|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
123:56:20|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Go ahead.
123:56:21|T|CC|Roger. Because of the lower load with the rendezvous radar off, we'd like to have battery 5 and 6 on the line now, 1 and 3 off. Over.
123:56:53|T|LMP(TRANQ)|In work.
123:56:55|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
123:57:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine to us.
123:57:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|...
123:58:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation on the ground that the ascent propulsion system propellant tanks have been pressurized.
123:58:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Network controller just informed the Flight Director that items called battle shorts have been installed around the network. These are mechanical shorts of critical power supplies and transmitters and the like, so that before they will go off-1ine, they'll actually burn up in critical phases of the mission. They want to get as much data as possible through the burn, so for that reason any circuit breaking function of the equipment is inhibited with these battle shorts. They're not a piece of apparel. In the upcoming ascent some 14 minutes from now, almost 5000 pounds of propellant will be run through the ascent engine to propel the Lunar Module upper stage or
123:58:00|P|PAO|Ascent Stage to velocity - total velocity of 6068 feet per second. Go through a vertical rise phase at about 50 seconds after liftover - liftoff will begin pitching over, and some 168 miles down range will be inserted into lunar orbit at about 60,000 feet above the surface. With an apolune of approximately forty -
123:58:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia is holding inertially at lift off attitude, my DAP is configured as per my procedures at a time of 124 02.
123:58:19|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy you.
123:58:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I'm using B and D roll.
123:58:41|T|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Say again.
123:58:51|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, we were not calling.
123:58:54|T|CC|Roger. Columbia, was that Bravo and Delta roll? Over.
123:59:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia, affirmative.
123:59:03|T|CC|Roger.
124:01:27|T|CC|Columbia and Tranquility, I'll give you a Mark at 20 minutes to go, and that's in about 20 seconds.
124:01:56|T|CC|Stand by.
124:01:59|T|CC|MARK.
124:02:00|T|CC|20 minutes.
124:02:06|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Roger.
124:03:26|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
124:03:31|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Go ahead.
124:03:32|T|CC|Roger. Just a reminder here, we want to make sure you leave the rendezvous radar circuit breakers pulled. However, we want the rendezvous radar mode switch in LGC, Just as it is on Surface 59.
124:03:48|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Okay.
124:04:43|T|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston.
124:04:49|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Roger. Go ahead.
124:04:51|T|CC|Roger. Our guidance recommendation is PGNS, and you're cleared for takeoff.
124:05:00|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. Understand. We're number 1 on the runway.
124:05:04|T|CC|Roger.
124:05:47|T|CDR(TRANQ)|Houston, Tranquility. We're not sure that we got number 2 tank to fire. It's still showing a high pressure.
124:06:03|T|CC|Roger. We confirm that. Try it again.
124:06:12|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. We'll go to number 2 this time.
124:06:15|T|CC|Roger. we concur.
124:06:24|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Roger. No problem.
124:08:00|P|PAO|- and about 60,000 feet above the surface. With an apolune of approximately 45 nautical miles half a revolution later on the far side of the Moon. We will continue to monitor air-ground here. We are some 1 hour away from loss of signal with the Lunar Module after its insertion. Eagle now 13 minutes away from - 13 minutes, 23 seconds away from ascent ignition. 124 hours, 8 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission. Apollo Control standing by.
124:08:00|P|PAO|Crew of Eagle going through their pre-ignition checklist.

124:09:00|T|CC|Roger.
124:09:02|T|LMP(TRANQ)|We've got number 2 reading 3050 and number 1 is reading - 3000 and it drops down to 2990. So I'm not sure that it's really indicative that it didn't go. Over.
124:09:17|T|CC|Roger. We copy and we agree.
124:09:55|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. I assume we're - we're GO for lift off, and we'll proceed with the ascent feed.
124:10:02|T|CC|Roger. That's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. If it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. Over.
124:10:26|T|LMP(TRANQ)|Okay. Ascent feeds are open and shutoffs are closed.
124:10:31|T|CC|Roger.
124:10:32|T|LMP(TRANQ)|And I've got the cross feed on.

124:41:43|T|CC|Eagle, Houston in the blind. Try low bit rate. Over.
124:41:55|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Low bit rate. I've got a 3.8 signal strength. Over.
124:42:13|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy your signal strength 3.8.
124:42:51|T|LMP(EAGLE)|37, I believe.
124:48:00|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
124:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are some 3 minutes to acquisition time for Columbia as it comes around on the 25th lunar revolution. We have had acquisition with Columbia. Some 26 minutes away from ignition time on the ascent burn which will place Eagle back into lunar orbit. Here we go.
124:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control in Mission Control. The lunar orbit chart on the center plot board has disappeared. We now have the various scribing plotters projecting on the center plot board to show the ascent. All of these lines and the various colors that are scribed on by the three sources of primary guidance system, the abort guidance system and the manned space-wide network all mean something to Flight Dynamics Officer. Let's rejoin the conversation.
124:48:06|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger. Go ahead.
124:48:07|T|CC|Roger. We saw a very slight jump in cabin and suit pressure there. Could you verify cabin REPRESS valve is closed?
124:48:24|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. It's closed.
124:48:26|T|CC|Roger. And we've got about 1 minute to before where you ought to be radar tracking, and we've lost data with you.
124:48:40|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. ...
124:49:03|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. Get a pass.
124:49:26|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Got it? ...
124:49:42|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia. You can turn your ... light off.
124:49:46|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. You got it?
124:49:48|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Yes.
124:49:50|T|LMP(EAGLE)|All ready to mark, X and Y. Okay. Marked X now.
124:49:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|...
124:50:02|T|LMP(EAGLE)|X or Y? Maybe we ought to be satisfied with three of them.
124:50:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|...
124:50:21|T|CC|Columbia, Houston - -
124:50:22|T|LMP(EAGLE)|... is still on.
124:50:23|T|CC|- - Say again.
124:50:25|T|LMP(EAGLE)|X or Y?
124:50:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|***
124:50:35|T|LMP(EAGLE)|I can't tell.
124:50:54|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. Mark Y.
124:51:06|T|LMP(EAGLE)|That enough? Beautiful! All zeros. Okay. Let's torque them. I'll write them down. Minus 06, plus 64, plus ... 7. Torque ... Radar circuit breakers in?
124:51:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|***
124:52:06|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Yes. We're pointed down pretty much. We're going to be up - -
124:52:08|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. ... circuit - -
124:52:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger.
124:52:13|T|LMP(EAGLE)|- - breaker in? Both circuit breakers in?
124:52:18|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|*** - -
124:52:19|T|MS|...
124:52:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|- - ***
124:52:26|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. AUTO maneuver.
124:52:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|***
124:52:40|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Did you call?
124:52:51|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That's affirmative. I called you before about the VHF ranging. It's not working. ***
124:53:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia has gone behind the Moon. Still a little over a minute left until Eagle goes behind the Moon. We'll catch these last few minutes of tracking and any possible conversation.
124:53:01|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, Eagle. Did you copy our star angle difference and torquing angles.
124:53:07|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We didn't have them on the downlink but we copied them on the VOX.
124:53:18|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. It was zero for star angle difference, minus 06, plus 64, and plus 1.37. Over.
124:53:28|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Roger. We have that.
124:54:02|T|LMP(EAGLE)|That's it. Got a good lockon, Houston.
124:54:26|T|LMP(EAGLE)|... take that.
124:54:59|T|LMP(EAGLE)|How about that?
124:55:28|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Your really think its apogee is 125 21, huh? 25 ... That circuit breaker is in.
124:55:54|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Engine arm circuit breaker.
124:57:03|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. There's a mark. Buy that?
124:57:24|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. If you have time, pitch 162, yaw minus 16.
124:58:32|T|LMP(EAGLE)|You load the REFSMMAT? Okay.
124:58:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia. Your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
124:58:44|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Mike, you're ...
124:58:53|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, do you read Columbia? Over.
124:59:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, this is Columbia. Over.
124:59:10|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
124:59:12|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear now. This is Houston.
124:59:17|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Would you tell Eagle his Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
124:59:24|T|CC|Roger. Eagle, Columbia says your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
124:59:37|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger, Houston. We got that. Thank you.
124:59:39|T|CC|Roger. And you can go high bit rate now. Eagle can.
125:00:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia. How do you read?
125:00:44|T|LMP(EAGLE)|AGS agrees very closely, and pointing ...
125:00:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia is unable to read Eagle on either antenna or on VHF duplex Bravo. You got any suggestions?
125:01:07|T|CC|Roger. Columbia, we understand. You are unable to read Eagle. Stand by.
125:01:23|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Houston, tell Columbia that we read him about strength 2.
125:02:00|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. Wide deadband on.
125:02:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.
125:02:20|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?
125:03:00|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. Over.
125:03:15|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Houston. Columbia's got the VHF ranging back now. I'll stick with the nominal. Thank you.
125:03:20|T|CC|Roger. Mighty fine.
125:03:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia reading you loud and clear now, Eagle.
125:04:54|T|CC|Columbia, Houston.
125:05:00|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead, Houston.
125:05:02|T|CC|Roger. Mike, you can go ahead and get as many VHF and sextant marks as you can here in this period of time.
125:05:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.
125:05:57|T|CC|Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute till LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.
125:06:22|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. VHF Bravo is off.
125:06:35|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Recommend aft OMNI and are you GO for CSI, so we can let Columbia know. Over.
125:06:47|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. We're GO for CSI.
125:06:52|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Did you copy? Eagle is GO for CSI.
125:06:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|No, I did not copy. I'm reading them only intermittently, but thank you.
125:06:58|O|LMP|...
125:07:02|T|CC|Roger.
125:07:08|O|CDR|Okay.
125:07:39|O|CDR|No. We'll wait until CDH.
125:08:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal with Eagle. Quite scratchy as Eagle went over the hill to complete the 25th lunar revolution as it gets to the midpoint on the lunar far side. Ascent burn just completed went quite well on time at 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up on this rev, approximately 10 minutes from now as a matter of fact, will be the concentric sequence initiate maneuver, CSI, which will raise the Eagle's perilune to some 45 nautical miles. Eagle now is in an orbit measuring 9.4 nautical miles at insertion or perilune, and 46.7 at apolune, This CSI maneuver will be made approximately at apolune. Therefore, the effect takes place 180 degrees later and has the effect of raising perilune to the desired 45 nautical miles. This maneuver will take place at 125 hours 19 minutes 34.7 seconds. He will have a DELTA-V or velocity change of 51.5 feet per second. All of these maneuvers, incidentally, in the rendezvous sequence by Eagle will be made by using the Reaction Control System of Eagle. Following the CSI at 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds a 9.2 foot per second burn, probably mostly a radial burn, at 126 hours 18 minutes will twist the Eagle's orbit to equal distance from the orbit of Columbia, what they call a constant DELTA height, or CDH maneuver. At 126 hours 57 minutes 00 seconds, terminal phase initiation, TPI. In this maneuver the crew visually thrusts along the line of sight toward Columbia when the line of sight is some 27 degrees above the local horizontal. This maneuver will have a magnitude of about 24.9 feet per second, and, in turn, it raises the apolune to 60.5 nautical miles, which is approximately the altitude Columbia's orbiting. Terminal phase finalization. TPF 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. This is the start time for a series of small burns which are a combination of mid-course correction and velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle in with Columbia and match the velocity so that they station-keep for a short period for photography, etc., and move on in to docking at approximately 128 hours Ground Elapsed Time. In all of these maneuvers Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver approximately a minute after the Eagle is scheduled to make its maneuver, and if for some reason Eagle can not make the maneuver, Collins would do the exact same maneuver only in reverse so that Columbia would in effect begin a CSM active rendezvous with Eagle. As Eagle went over the hill on the 25th revolution, a velocity was being measured at 5410 feet per second. Eagle's weight somewhat lighter than when it started out in excess of
125:08:00|P|PAO|32,000 pounds, it's now shrunk to some 5885 pounds. Some 39 minutes 20 seconds away from acquisition of Columbia. 41 minutes 45 seconds from acquisition of Eagle as the 2 vehicles come around on the 26th revolution. The crew will likely describe how the CSI burn went, which is some 5 minutes away from this point, and at 125 hours 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
125:08:09|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We'll see you coming around the other side. Your AOS time - is 1 minute ahead of the Flight Plan.
125:08:17|O|CDR|Okay, thank you.
125:08:18|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. Thank you.
125:08:37|O|CDR|Okay.
125:09:31|O|CDR|No, I didn't; go ahead, Mike.
125:09:39|O|CDR|I think we are now, finally, and I think I have you in sight.
125:09:57|O|CDR|We have 51 5.
125:10:19|O|CDR|Well, the ground's got 51 5, and we got 51 5. Yes. First time we've ever agreed on anything.
125:10:41|O|LMP|Want these ... first?
125:10:43|O|CDR|Not yet.
125:10:45|O|LMP|I don't know why.
125:11:17|O|LMP|I had to turn my S-band off so I could hear him - my S-band switch on the audio panel. Woo-woo!
125:11:31|O|CDR|Yes, that works good.
125:11:51|O|LMP|Not at this point, no.
125:12:42|O|CDR|Okay.
125:13:11|O|LMP|... Hey, Mike, how do you read me?
125:13:24|O|LMP|Okay, let's go to B DATA on your command.
125:13:59|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
125:14:06|O|LMP|Loud and clear.
125:14:10|O|LMP|Affirmative; we're at the burn attitude, too.
125:15:10|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. When you get a chance, could you give me the - the CSI P76 pad and your NOUN 84 and your NOUN 33?
125:15:21|O|LMP|Yes, we'll do that in a minute.
125:15:25|O|CMP|Alright.
125:15:50|O|LMP|Okay, Mike, you want the burn time and the NOUN 81; is that right?
125:16:00|O|LMP|Okay, the burn time is 125:19:34.7, and the burn is 51.5, zero, and zero.
125:16:16|O|CMP|Okay, I understand. Plus 51.5, zeros, and zeros, and you're using 125:19:34.70. Thank you kindly.
125:18:45|O|CMP|I'm in maneuver attitude, all set to burn if necessary. I've got about 45 minutes to TIG - 45 seconds to TIG.
125:18:51|O|LMP|Okay.
125:19:46|O|LMP|We're burning, Mike.
125:21:36|O|LMP|Burn complete, Mike.
125:21:39|O|CMP|Good show.
125:22:59|O|LMP|Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58. Over.
125:23:12|O|CMP|Roger; copy. CDH, 126:17:45.58.
125:23:21|O|LMP|Affirmative.
125:28:33|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. I have you in an orbit 49.5 by 46.1.
125:28:43|O|LMP|Okay, thank you.
125:29:09|O|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. I'd like to go back to VHF RANGING configuration, please, on your mark.
125:29:15|O|LMP|Roger. On my mark -
125:29:17|O|LMP|MARK, VHF RANGING.
125:30:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 26
125:30:37|O|LMP|...
125:30:40|O|CDR|Well, which way did I go?
125:30:42|O|LMP|... out of plane.
125:30:45|O|CDR|What?
125:30:46|O|LMP|Did you hear that?
125:30:57|O|LMP|Why you don't hear these 3 – 3500-pound rocket engines when you're sitting on them, I'll never know.
125:31:03|O|CDR|Yes.

125:32:48|O|CDR|... B?
125:32:50|O|LMP|Not on A.
125:32:58|O|CDR|(Laughter) That's your story, huh?
125:33:25|O|CDR|That's rugged country.
125:34:15|O|LMP|Yes, that perigee we're on ...
125:34:20|O|CDR|... alright, isn't it?
125:34:31|O|LMP|I got 4 feet forward and I got back 7 ...
125:34:38|O|CDR|Boy, this water separator sure isn't working worth a durn. Maybe we ought to try the other one - ... water. Oh boy, this thing is just really spitting it.
125:34:53|O|LMP|I sure do; it's been on - yes, we do - it's been on all the time.
125:35:06|O|CDR|We should see the tracking light now - That's it - Doesn't look ... but it's not - turned off.
125:35:16|O|LMP|Okay, let's try and get a Y-dot, or an R-dot, at 30 seconds.
125:35:21|O|CDR|It'll be the first time we've ever done it.
125:35:30|O|LMP|No, let me get COMM.
125:35:48|O|LMP|We're really going to be crying.
125:35:50|O|CDR|[Simulated crying]
125:35:54|O|CDR|My - top thruster over here has got a lot of brown holes in it - in the exit nozzle.
125:36:05|O|CDR|See it?
125:36:06|O|LMP|Yes.
125:36:13|O|LMP|You know, these thrusters aren't used much over here. Well, maybe ... or something.
125:36:31|O|CDR|See it?
125:36:34|O|LMP|No.
125:36:46|O|LMP|When we get the sun behind us, we might be able to.
125:37:04|O|LMP|Hey, I got to recycle. Then after ...
125:37:28|O|LMP|It's all over me.
125:37:38|O|LMP|Coming out of that vent back of my neck, isn't it? That where it's coming out?
125:38:44|O|LMP|Give us the CSI state vector - navigation difference - no updating CSI ...
125:39:02|O|LMP|Through AGS.
125:39:21|O|LMP|...
125:39:45|O|LMP|Thinking about it.
125:39:51|O|CDR|You going to come up with a solution for us?
125:40:33|O|CDR|Range rate?
125:40:35|O|LMP|Range rate.

125:43:21|O|LMP|Yes.
125:43:22|O|CDR|Sure shook them up. I remember that Gene said theirs didn't drop a bit - remember that – when they pressurized? Don't think theirs dropped at all.
125:44:37|O|LMP|Okay.
125:44:43|O|CDR|We're getting minus 2.9.
125:44:48|O|LMP|Going AGS all the way, huh?
125:44:50|O|CDR|Yes, forget it.
125:44:54|O|LMP|Get more tracking if we forget.
125:45:01|O|CDR|No, we'll just - we'll just wait until CDH.
125:46:19|O|CDR|You got a lot of film left in there?
125:46:23|O|LMP|About half.
125:46:26|O|CDR|You could run it some here. Oh, you just – you want to leave some for docking, huh?
125:46:50|O|CDR|... Got that cockpit all cleaned up so that we got places for all our trash, Mike?
125:47:02|O|CMP|...
125:47:21|O|CDR|Yes, we got them all over us - look like chimney sweeps.
125:47:36|O|CDR|You bet you. Nice to get home.
125:48:06|O|LMP|... up tracking -
125:48:22|O|LMP|Got that?
125:48:24|O|CDR|What do you need?
125:48:27|O|LMP|That right-angle bracket, the right-angle bracket, need that -
125:48:44|O|CDR|It's not over here. Well, that's a good day not to throw in some failures. See if we can run the nominal one time.
125:52:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 125 hours, 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Less than 1 minute away from the acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia coming around on the near side of the Moon on the twenty sixth revolution. Some 3 minutes, 11 seconds away from Eagle's appearance on on the lunar front side. Stand by here for word. We have acquired data and voice link. Spacecraft Communicator, Ron Evans, is standing by for AOS so that he can pass some information to the crew of the two spacecraft. We have AOS of the spacecraft, Columbia.
125:52:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia is now in an orbit measuring 56.6 nautical miles by 62.5 nautical miles, and the display here in Mission Control shows that the range from Eagle to Columbia of a tad over 100 miles. And about 99 feet per second closure rate.
125:52:58|O|LMP|CO2.
125:53:12|O|CDR|I don't think so, Mike, we got to - ...
125:53:24|O|LMP|... want to go to that - ...
125:53:26|O|CMP|Stand by for ...
125:53:27|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|...
125:53:32|O|CDR|Right, that's what we've got.
125:53:39|O|LMP|...
125:53:51|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Heard you talked to Eagle? I assume you have COMM with Eagle now?
125:55:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
125:55:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia in OMNI D Delta. Over.
125:56:15|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
125:56:17|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You're very weak. Say again.
125:56:26|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Houston, Columbia. CSI nominal; no plane change. Everything's going beautifully, and the LM seems to be ...your laser...
125:56:47|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You're about one by, I could just barely make you out. I can't understand.
125:57:06|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. How now?
125:57:22|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
125:57:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
125:58:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, Columbia. Over.
125:58:24|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, this is Eagle. Over.
125:58:27|T|CC|Hey, Eagle. Houston loud and clear. Columbia was very weak. We were unable to read him.
125:58:36|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. We saw you come up over the horizon and it looks like you had a laser operating. Could you confirm that?
125:58:46|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?
125:59:01|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Stand by.
125:59:24|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.
125:59:57|T|CC|Eagle - Eagle, Houston. We copy. Any plane change? Over.
126:00:04|T|LMP(EAGLE)|No. There was no plane change on CSI, and CSM had a 2.3 foot per second burn. We had a 2.9, and we elected to postpone that. Over.
126:00:18|T|CC|Roger. We copy, Eagle. Thank you.
126:00:28|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, how do you read Columbia now?
126:00:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, how about asking them for some high-gain angles for me, will you, please?
126:00:46|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger, Houston, do you have some high-gain angles for Columbia? Over.
126:00:54|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. And, Columbia, stand by. We'll have them for you shortly.
126:01:15|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Could you verify you switched lithium hydroxide canisters? Over.
126:01:24|T|LMP(EAGLE)|That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.
126:01:38|T|CC|Roger. We copy. Mighty fine.
126:01:47|T|CC|Columbia and Eagle. Request OMNI Delta for Columbia.
126:01:57|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger, Houston. I've been in Delta the whole time but it doesn't ...
126:02:09|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Houston. Columbia's been on Delta, but he hasn't had much luck with you.
126:02:18|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
126:03:20|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, are you ready to copy your Y dot?
126:03:29|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Go ahead.
126:03:30|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|***
126:04:25|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like to go ahead and try your lithium hydroxides on the primary and let us take a look at it down here.
126:05:04|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
126:05:09|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Go ahead, Houston. ***
126:05:39|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Houston, Eagle. Columbia's been reading you loud and clear on his OMNI's, but he hasn't had any luck in transmitting to you.
126:05:50|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. Mighty fine. We don't hear Columbia though.
126:06:00|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
126:07:00|P|PAO|Apollo Control here. Less than a minute remaining until the constant DELTA height or CDH maneuver. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground. This small magnitude radial burn to put Eagle in a orbit that's concentric with -
126:07:32|T|LMP(EAGLE)|We're burning ours, Mike. Minus 1.8.
126:08:32|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. ...
126:08:40|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. ...
126:09:42|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
126:09:59|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You can go ahead and go to REACQ in the high-gain. We should get you then.
126:10:16|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Do you have some angles for him, Houston?
126:10:18|T|CC|Roger. Pitch minus 30, yaw 180, for Columbia.
126:10:29|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. And what was your CSI - CDH solution, Mike?
126:10:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|***
126:11:18|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Copy. Thank you.
126:11:31|T|CDR(EAGLE)|And, Houston, Eagle. Got an ECS light - a CO2 light. Partial pressure's reading about one half millimeter.
126:11:42|T|CC|Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy.
126:12:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Houston, how do you read Columbia?
126:12:08|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Go.
126:12:22|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We're sure that's a sensor problem. You can leave it on PRIMARY.
126:12:30|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
126:12:41|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger. We pulled the circuit breakers.
126:12:45|T|CC|Roger, Eagle.
126:13:01|T|CDR(EAGLE)|And our water separator apparently isn't working too well. We're getting a lot of water through the suit loop, and we've changed water separators, but it doesn't seem to have improved the situation any.
126:13:20|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
126:13:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia. Standing by to back you up on the burn. Just let me know how it's going.
126:13:53|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
126:13:58|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. You want to know what our NOUN 81 is?
126:14:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
126:14:05|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. I think you already got the burn time; minus 8.1, minus 1.8, minus 18.2.
126:14:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay, that's pretty close agreement. And, for burn time, I still have 126 17 46.
126:14:26|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger.
126:15:06|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. For warm feeling, we are agreeing with your CDH.
126:15:15|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Congratulations.
126:15:28|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Unfortunately, the chart doesn't agree with it, because the range rate at 36 minutes was off the chart.
126:17:00|P|PAO|- the Eagle in an orbit that's concentric with. Here we go. 30 seconds.
126:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Range now showing 91.3 nautical miles, range rate, rate of closure 119 feet per second.
126:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Range between Eagle and Columbia now showing 67.5 nautical miles. Range rate, closure rate, 121 feet per second.
126:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 25 minutes now until the TPI, terminal phase initiation burn, just before loss of signal as both spacecraft go over the hill.
126:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control the Black Team of Flight Controllers here in Mission Control are more or less in an advisory capacity during this rendezvous sequence. They're actively computing maneuver times, but in the final analysis it's onboard computations by the crew of Columbia and Eagle which really bring about the rendezvous. Standing by.
126:17:00|P|PAO|which nearly bring about to rendezvous. Standing by at 126 hours 37 minutes Ground Elapsed Times. Some 24 minutes away from ignition on the thrust along the line of sight for Terminal Phase Initiate.
126:17:18|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thirty seconds.
126:17:20|T|CDR(EAGLE)|We're ready to burn.
126:17:21|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
126:17:31|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Yes. I'm ready. ...
126:18:49|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Burn complete?
126:18:51|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Burn complete.
126:18:52|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
126:19:47|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. When you get a chance, are your LCG's hooked up? And if so, what does the LCG accumulator show?
126:20:37|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia. Passing over the Landing Site. It sure is great to look down there and not see you.
126:20:46|T|LMP(EAGLE)|...
126:21:04|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
126:21:08|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Go ahead.
126:21:09|T|CC|Roger. Did you copy on the LCG, there, and the reading on the water accumulator?
126:21:15|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Yes. Roger. I did. I'm getting ...
126:22:20|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, the water accumulator is right on the line between the red and the green. Over.
126:22:26|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
126:24:13|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
126:24:19|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Houston, Eagle.
126:24:20|T|CC|Roger. On the water problem, we can't add anything more to it, except the fact that it looks like the water accumulators are up to speed to us down here.
126:24:35|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. It's not going to be too much trouble.
126:24:39|T|CC|Roger. Fine.
126:24:40|T|LMP(EAGLE)|It's just in one suit, too, for some reason.
126:26:29|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Our COMM problem was traced to a ground station here.
126:26:38|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Glad to hear it.
126:26:39|T|CC|Roger. You're mighty fine now.
126:32:35|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Range rate at 30.
126:32:43|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I have a TPI TIG when you guys want to compare them.
126:32:48|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Stand by.
126:33:05|T|LMP(EAGLE)|... 19.8.
126:33:15|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Go ahead, Mike. What have you got?
126:33:19|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|127 02 3450.
126:33:25|T|LMP(EAGLE)|You're about 32 seconds *** than we are.
126:33:29|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay, fine.
126:35:01|T|LMP(EAGLE)|***
126:39:12|T|SC|*** and I'll do it.
126:39:52|T|LMP(EAGLE)|*** want to get another *** data update ***
126:40:50|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Mark it *** range.
126:42:55|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Mark.
126:42:56|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Range rate at 40.
126:44:16|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Buzz, I would like to confirm that your TPI TIG is 127 02 02. Over.
126:44:25|T|LMP(EAGLE)|We haven't settled on a final one yet. The last one was - stand by.
126:45:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Understand.
126:45:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Just as soon as you know what TPI TIG is going to be, I would appreciate a call.
126:45:18|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay.
126:45:24|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Last I got was 32 seconds earlier than mine which would make it 127 02 02.
126:45:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you. Are you going to be revising that one?
126:45:44|T|LMP(EAGLE)|I think probably so. How late - How late can you take a revision?
126:45:56|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Well, to stay on my time line, I should have it in the next couple of minutes.
126:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control about 6 and 1/2 minutes to ignition on the thermal phase maneuver in which the crew Eagle will thrust along the line of sight toward Columbia. Distance now between the two spacecraft
126:48:00|P|PAO|some 38.6 nautical miles closing at a rate of 110 feet per second.
126:48:07|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Okay. Latest estimate, 127 03 39.
126:48:14|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you kindly,
126:48:41|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
126:48:45|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Go ahead.
126:48:47|T|CC|Roger. In the event of the possibility that we may have had some water channeling in those hydroxide canisters, we recommend you stay in the cabin mode from now on. Over.
126:49:03|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger.
126:51:25|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
126:51:30|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Go ahead.
126:51:32|T|CC|Roger. I'd better clarify that cabin mode a little bit there. What we mean is you go ahead and stay in the cabin mode. Helmets and gloves on are your option. And we really have no concern with the CO2. Over.
126:51:52|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Understand.
126:52:51|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Mike, you already loaded that time? We've got a final one here.
126:52:58|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|I've already loaded it. I don't think it'll make much difference.
126:53:01|T|LMP(EAGLE)|Roger. Only 9 seconds difference.
126:53:04|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|MARKS next.
126:54:06|T|CC|Columbia, Houston.
126:54:12|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Columbia. Go ahead.
126:54:13|T|CC|Roger, Mike. You can go ahead and arm your logic anytime you want to, and we'll give you a GO so that you can get your PYRO ARM at your convenience.
126:54:23|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That's a good idea, babe. You standing by to watch the logic?
126:54:26|T|CC|Affirmative. Give us a Mark.
126:54:30|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|MARK LOGIC 1.
126:54:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|MARK LOGIC 2.
126:54:59|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We need the SEQ ARM circuit breakers closed.
126:55:08|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay. Going in SEQ ARM BATT A, and BATT B.
126:55:27|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Logic looks good. You can arm your PYRO's at your convenience.
126:55:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Thank you.
126:55:55|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Eagle, Columbia's starting to maneuver to TPI attitude.
126:55:58|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
126:57:20|T|CC|Eagle and Columbia, Houston. All your solutions look good to us. Out.
126:58:18|T|LMP(EAGLE)|And, Mike, if you want our target DELTA V, I'll give it to you.
126:58:22|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Ready to copy.
126:58:23|T|LMP(EAGLE)|127 03 3082, plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Over.
126:58:41|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|127 03 3082, plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Thank you.
126:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've apparently had loss of signal with Columbia and Eagle as they went behind the Moon on the 26th revolution. Next maneuver scheduled for about 33 minutes from now. While both vehicles are behind this will be the breaking series of maneuvers coming down to docking, or station keeping first and then docking at about 128 hours Ground Elapsed Time. And at 127 hours 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control.
127:00:55|T|CDR(EAGLE)|I'm showing a good bit of out of plane velocity on my cross pointers, Mike.
127:01:03|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. I have no indication of it.
127:02:31|O|CMP|Coming up on 1 minute to TIG. Neil, how's it looking?
127:02:32|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Coming up on 1 minute to TIG, Neil. How's it looking?
127:02:36|O|CDR|Pretty good.
127:02:38|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Pretty good.
127:02:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Good.
127:02:41|O|LMP|That last out of plane was in the AGS, not the radar.
127:02:43|T|CDR(EAGLE)|That out of plane was in the AGS, not in the radar.
127:02:45|O|CMP|Alright.
127:02:47|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger that.
127:03:05|O|LMP|...
127:03:07|O|CDR|Okay.
127:03:47|O|CDR|Ready to burn?
127:03:48|O|LMP|Okay.
127:03:50|O|CDR|We're burning.
127:03:52|T|CDR(EAGLE)|We're burning.
127:03:54|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|That a boy!
127:04:32|O|CDR|Okay, that's it.
127:04:34|O|CMP|Burn complete?
127:04:35|O|CDR|Burn's complete. Did you read? Burn's complete.
127:04:36|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Burn complete?
127:04:40|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Read burn complete.
127:04:40|O|CMP|Thank you.
127:04:42|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Roger. Thank you.

127:06:55|O|CDR|Pretty reasonable.
127:06:59|O|LMP|AGS had these residuals after its completion after the burn.
127:07:39|O|CDR|I can't see you, Michael.
127:07:44|O|CMP|... moving in at ...
127:07:50|O|CDR|Okay. I got good radar; I just can't see you.
127:08:03|O|CMP|...
127:08:49|O|LMP|Do you think that pressure dropped?
127:08:51|O|CDR|Yes.
127:08:54|O|LMP|It doesn't show up in the ... books. I don't see any reason why we don't take them all back. All that we've got - -

127:10:20|O|LMP|Okay, you try getting it - ...?
127:10:25|O|CDR|No, I haven't been; do you want me to?
127:10:27|O|LMP|No, I got to keep the chart.
127:10:58|O|CDR|... can take this update for them.
127:12:00|O|LMP|On the track about, huh?
127:12:21|O|LMP|Boy, my shoulders sure hurt.
127:12:23|O|CDR|Mine are, too.
127:12:26|O|LMP|Last night I couldn't get this far from the ...
127:12:30|O|CDR|I was the same way.
127:13:00|O|LMP|Use all the green tape, did you?
127:14:31|O|CDR|I got it in sight now, Mike.
127:14:34|O|CMP|...
127:15:33|O|LMP|...
127:15:39|O|CDR|Okay.
127:16:08|O|SC|(Yawn)
127:16:12|O|CMP|...
127:16:18|O|LMP|Yes, so do we.

127:20:41|O|CDR|...
127:20:51|O|LMP|You still got him?
127:20:55|O|CDR|Yes. I probably won't when the sun gets in my telescope.

127:21:19|O|CMP|... going right down the ... and it sure has been nice.
127:21:23|O|CDR|Okay. I just got sight of you in the sunlight here.
127:21:27|O|CMP|Okay.
127:21:29|O|LMP|Oh, I've got him.
127:21:43|O|LMP|...
127:21:51|O|CDR|I've got him now, too.
127:22:00|O|LMP|Sure enough.
127:22:11|O|CMP|Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.
127:22:15|O|CDR|That's good.
127:22:19|O|CMP|...
127:22:27|O|CDR|You're not confused on which end to dock with, are you?
127:22:34|O|CMP|...
127:22:58|O|CDR|Okay, Mike, if there's some data bags around there - I may have one or two in my temporary stowage - why, we may want them in addition to the other regular bags, so we can put some of this data back in it.
127:23:13|O|CMP|In the data bags?
127:23:16|O|CDR|Yes, there are a couple of different LM bags that I left in there.
127:23:21|O|CMP|Okay, well, why don't we ... back over there and ...?
127:23:26|O|CDR|Right.
127:23:39|O|CMP|... bring the bag ...
127:23:45|O|CDR|Could be.
127:23:47|O|CMP|Alright.
127:24:13|O|CMP|Okay, ... have a plastic one and a ...
127:24:23|O|CMP|Bring the ... back.
127:24:40|O|CDR|I think we'll make it (laughter).
127:24:44|O|LMP|Don't tell that to poor ..., though (laughter).
127:24:47|O|CMP|...
127:24:56|O|CDR|We'll see you at ...

127:25:36|O|LMP|How about picking the closest one?
127:25:44|O|CDR|Good idea.
127:26:17|O|LMP|... this light?
127:26:21|O|CDR|Is that alright?
127:26:37|O|CDR|Okay, at 49 000 feet, we're supposed to be 65 feet per second - our little old chart says. And our LOS rate's supposed to be about O.1; it's about point - -

127:27:29|O|CDR|Not exactly.
127:27:30|O|LMP|Not exactly?
127:27:32|O|CDR|You're a little less. You're 10 seconds less in ... About that ...
127:28:23|O|CDR|Look's like you're making a high ... on us, Michael.
127:28:27|O|CMP|Yes, ...
127:29:26|O|CMP|... let me move in just a ...
127:29:31|O|CDR|No, we aren't that - confident.
127:30:08|O|CDR|...?
127:30:12|O|LMP|We've got about 54.
127:30:47|O|CDR|You got ... to ...?
127:30:49|O|LMP|Huh?
127:30:50|O|CDR|The ...?
127:30:51|O|LMP|Yes. ...
127:31:05|O|CDR|Let's try this mid-course out.
127:31:08|O|LMP|Right. Okay, it's ...
127:31:37|O|LMP|...
127:31:40|O|CDR|Is that right, I hope?
127:31:42|O|LMP|Yes.
127:31:59|O|CDR|It should be 70.
127:32:25|O|LMP|Okay, I can see the shape of your vehicle now, Mike.
127:32:42|O|CDR|Oh, yes - got your high-gain in sight; your tracking light - whole vehicle shows. I see that you're pointed at me. Now, you're turning a little bit - great.
127:33:39|O|CMP|...
127:33:49|O|CMP|Are you burning yet?
127:33:50|O|CDR|We're burning.
127:33:51|O|CMP|...
127:34:15|O|LMP|Good enough.
127:34:21|O|CDR|Seems like when you get down to around 110, you just keep chasing him. You put it in – stick it in one axis, and it goes through - out of another, especially when ... stays about the same.
127:34:30|O|LMP|If it's ..., it's definite.
127:34:43|O|LMP|Okay, now, let's see; we want to change the DAP - that what we want to do?
127:34:48|O|CDR|Yes.
127:34:49|O|CMP|I need a P76 now, Buzz.
127:34:54|O|LMP|Okay, you got the time for the burn; NOUN 81 was plus 0.1, plus 1.2, plus 0.5.
127:35:05|O|CMP|...
127:35:23|O|LMP|... plus ...
127:35:38|O|CDR|Okay. ... 45 -
127:36:14|O|CDR|8.2 miles, 40 feet per second.
127:36:26|O|LMP|You can have your place now.
127:36:49|O|CMP|...
127:36:52|O|CDR|Okay.
127:37:01|O|LMP|Can you see our tracking light, now?
127:37:04|O|CMP|... but you're in between my sextant and my COAS.
127:38:33|O|LMP|Where'd you put the ...?
127:38:35|O|CDR|My what?
127:38:36|O|LMP|Your ... for ...
127:38:39|O|CDR|It's in the bottom over ...
127:39:30|O|CMP|... pick me up ...
127:39:33|O|CDR|I got you.
127:39:34|O|CMP|Okay. Don't ... other spacecraft.
127:39:40|O|LMP|No, I'm not going to lose you, brother.
127:39:49|O|CMP|What have you got for ...? ... I have 6.8 and 9 miles, ... out. Oh, that checks.
127:40:06|O|CDR|Got ... up? I thought I made it pretty clear.
127:40:20|O|LMP|Not as sporty a ... as we thought, huh?
127:40:25|O|CDR|That wasn't - bad at all; the alignment was - pretty dicey.
127:40:31|O|LMP|Yes, sir.
127:40:34|O|CDR|That was just luck (laughter).
127:40:39|O|LMP|I hope you ...
127:40:49|O|LMP|I'll be glad to get to the ...
127:40:52|O|CDR|Yes, but I hate to ...; will you get ...?
127:40:57|O|LMP|Okay.
127:41:02|O|CDR|Oh, it'll come off, I guess - ...
127:41:07|O|LMP|These screws here - -
127:41:08|O|CDR|Alright, there's a couple of bolts - -
127:41:10|O|LMP|- - these screws here might do it.
127:41:13|O|CDR|- - there's a couple of bolts down there that have come loose - if I remember. ... I'llget them.
127:41:21|O|CMP|I'm slowly closing at 32 feet per second and a mile and a half.
127:41:25|O|CDR|Okay, I've got a mile and a half and 32-1/2.
127:41:28|O|CMP|...
127:41:40|O|LMP|Take ...
127:41:43|O|CDR|Yes, I guess it'll take us another - 6 minutes or something like that.
127:41:47|O|LMP|Yes.
127:41:48|O|CMP|... we got 15 ...
127:41:57|O|CMP|...
127:42:01|O|CDR|Okay.
127:42:23|O|LMP|That's going to hit the braking gate right on the schedule.
127:42:30|O|CDR|Yes.
127:43:02|O|CDR|Okay, let's put P47 in.
127:43:22|O|CDR|I don't know why I lost my - I'm at - oh, did you - you lost your transponder, Mike - I think.
127:43:33|O|CMP|... pitch up a bit.
127:43:36|O|CDR|I wish you would.
127:43:43|O|CMP|I have 0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second, ... look good.
127:43:50|O|LMP|Okay, ...
127:43:53|O|CMP|...?
127:43:57|O|LMP|Okay, we're getting it.
127:43:59|O|CMP|... -
127:44:12|O|CMP|Are you ... forward now?
127:44:15|O|LMP|Yes - yes, we're in good shape, Mike; we're braking.
127:44:17|O|CMP|Okay.
127:44:52|O|CMP|...
127:44:53|O|CDR|Flying all over us.
127:46:13|O|CDR|Okay, we're about 11 feet a second coming in at you
127:46:17|O|CMP|...
127:46:43|O|CMP|That's good. What ... are you in?
127:47:05|O|LMP|Hope we're not going to get a pitch straight down.
127:47:16|O|CDR|We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do - ...
127:47:55|O|CMP|...
127:47:59|O|CDR|Looks good.
127:49:06|O|CMP|I'm sure you're going to get ..., I'll tell you that.
127:49:11|O|CDR|It flies good, though.
127:49:16|O|CMP|...?
127:49:50|O|CDR|Okay, now, if I pitch over, I'm going to be looking right into the sun.
127:50:00|O|CMP|...
127:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 127 hours 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're less than a minute now away from acquisition of the spacecraft, Columbia. Hopefully, we find within a few feet of it, will be Eagle. Docking should take place about 10 minutes from now, according to the Flight Plan. However, this is a crew option matter. We're standing by for word that data is coming in from the two spacecraft. This is lunar revolution number 27 for Columbia. We have LM AOS
127:50:09|O|LMP|Hope you know how to roll.
127:50:11|O|CMP|Yes, I do. I ...
127:50:23|O|LMP|You want to end up with that window – opposite his right window so you don't want to roll right. Right?
127:50:32|O|CDR|Yes.
127:50:34|O|LMP|The only trouble is, it's towards - towards 90, isn't it?
127:50:56|O|LMP|You could - you -
127:50:58|O|CDR|If I roll 120 - it'll roll left
127:51:06|O|LMP|90, huh? ... 60?
127:51:21|O|CDR|Well, why don't I start to roll - -
127:51:24|O|LMP|Yes, I think if you roll up 60 –
127:51:29|O|CDR|I'll be looking into his left window when I pitch up.
127:51:32|O|LMP|I don't think so. If you did it right now you'd - -
127:51:36|O|CMP|... I got the Earth coming up already; it's fantastic!
127:51:40|O|CDR|Okay, you got me.
127:51:42|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay. You've got me.
127:52:00|T|CC|Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
127:52:00|O|CC|Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
127:52:05|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Roger. We're stationkeeping.
127:52:05|O|CDR|Roger; we're stationkeeping.
127:52:08|T|CC|Roger.
127:52:08|O|CC|Roger.
127:52:24|O|LMP|Pitch up ... pass right up just a little, you got a better view - bottom side - ... - move back.
127:52:45|O|CMP|... - that's right.
127:53:08|O|CDR|Okay. I'm getting about into the right attitude, I think. ...
127:53:18|O|LMP|Yes.
127:53:21|O|CDR|That roll's pretty far; I don't know just how much - so that's - Oh, it's going to go BLOCK!
127:53:28|O|LMP|That's it - going to AGS?
127:53:32|O|CDR|Yes, ... ATT DEADBAND.
127:54:11|O|CDR|Okay, Mike, I'll get - try to get in position here, and then you got it.
127:54:13|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay, Mike. I'll get - try to get in position here, then you got it.
127:54:18|O|CMP|Okay.
127:54:37|O|CDR|How does the roll attitude look?
127:54:39|T|CDR(EAGLE)|How does the roll attitude look?
127:54:41|O|CMP|...
127:54:47|O|CDR|Let's see how the DSKY thinks it looks.
127:54:52|O|CMP|Have you stopped rolling yet?
127:54:54|O|CDR|I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here, if you like that.
127:54:55|T|CDR(EAGLE)|I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here if you like that.
127:54:59|O|CMP|Need a little bit more. That's the way; keep it going. Need a little more ... That's the way, keep going - go a little bit more - go ahead - go ahead - okay, stop. Okay, I got it now.
127:55:27|O|LMP|You got the ... in ...?
127:55:36|O|CDR|Yes. Right there. Okay, ... 1 -
127:55:55|O|LMP|Well, we might need to at least have a platform ...
127:56:01|O|CDR|Yes.
127:56:27|O|CMP|Okay, now, Neil, when you feel us contact, you're going to turn ... seconds, is that right?
127:56:30|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Middle gimbal. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.
127:56:33|O|LMP|That's right.
127:56:34|O|CMP|Okay, Buzz.
127:56:35|T|CDR(EAGLE)|That's right.
127:57:12|O|LMP|We got a platform to make.
127:57:13|O|CDR|Okay.
127:57:32|O|CDR|I'm not going to do a thing, Mike; I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.
127:57:34|T|CDR(EAGLE)|I'm not going to do a thing, Mike. I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.
127:57:38|O|CMP|Okay.
127:57:40|T|CMP(COLUMBIA)|Okay.
127:57:55|O|CDR|I think we ought to be at 4 JETS for this, ... AGS.
127:58:04|O|LMP|HOLD.
127:58:13|O|CDR|...
127:58:42|O|CDR|He's about 15 feet out now.
127:58:45|O|LMP|Okay, I'd better try out the radar.
127:58:52|O|CDR|Don't you want to beef up that radar?
127:58:59|O|LMP|Yes.
127:59:00|O|CDR|Good.
127:59:06|O|CDR|Ready to pull the circuit breakers?
127:59:08|O|LMP|Okay. You ready?
127:59:10|O|CDR|Yes.
127:59:12|O|LMP|They're pulled.
127:59:14|O|CDR|He's 10 feet. About 5 feet, I guess.
127:59:23|O|CDR|Looks good, Mike.
127:59:35|O|LMP|Okay, they're pulled.
127:59:39|O|CDR|Pull it out.
127:59:40|O|LMP|Okay. Circuit breakers - -
128:00:50|T|CDR(EAGLE)|You ...
128:00:56|T|CDR(EAGLE)|Okay.
128:03:12|T|CDR|Okay. We're all yours. Roger.
128:03:17|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, I have thrusters B3 and C4 safetied.
128:03:30|T|LMP|Okay.
128:03:43|T|CMP|I'm pumping up cabin pressure.
128:04:29|T|CMP|That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?
128:04:50|T|CDR|Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.
128:05:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Communications are somewhat scratchy with Apollo 11. Columbia and Eagle now reunited to become Apollo 11 again. Our best estimate on the time of docking is some 3 minutes after the pre-mission time of 128 hours. Continuing to monitor this 27th lunar orbit for the two-way communications between the two spacecraft.
128:05:09|T|CMP|Yes. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.
128:05:19|T|CMP|Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.
128:05:22|T|CDR|Yes. I agree with that, but we hear you okay. Over.
128:05:36|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
128:05:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
128:05:44|T|CMP|Roger. I'm supposed to adjust the oxygen flow in this thing to six tenths of a pound per hour, but being as how this transducer is not working right, could you give me an updated number?
128:05:55|T|CC|Affirmative. You want to go ahead and adjust your O2 flow until it just goes off the peg, and then crank the direct O2 valve back down about 5 degrees. Over.
128:06:14|T|CMP|Boy, you were really waiting for that one, weren't you? Okay, Ron. Thank you.
128:06:59|T|CMP|Houston, I did that, and I believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged FULL SCALE LOW.
128:07:08|T|CC|Roger. That's fine. That's what we expect.
128:07:13|T|CMP|Okay.
128:07:24|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to go ahead with the tunnel leak check.
128:07:32|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. I have a new LM weight for you whenever you're ready to copy.
128:07:45|T|CMP|Not right now, Ron. Remind me of it later, would you please?
128:07:50|T|CC|Roger. We'll stand by.
128:08:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I let P47 run longer than I should. I may have deteriorated our state vector slightly.
128:09:06|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. That's okay. We'll see later.
128:11:03|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with your DAP up, please.
128:11:07|T|CC|Roger. Your LM weight, 5785. For an R1 we'd like to have 61102, R2 01111. Use BD roll. Over.
128:11:35|T|CMP|Roger. I'm configured now at ... for BD roll, and I have thrusters C4 and B3 turned off, and I copy register 1 61102 01111 and LM weight 5785. Thank you.
128:11:52|T|CC|Roger, Columbia.
128:13:57|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia has completed the leak check, and proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.
128:14:07|T|CC|Roger, Columbia. Understand you're doing the leak check. I missed anything after that.
128:14:13|T|CMP|I say the leak check is complete, and I'm proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.
128:14:23|T|CC|Eagle - Columbia, Roger.
128:15:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control still rather noisy communications here on the 27th lunar revolution. 39 minutes remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon. We'll leave the circuit up and try to monitor the conversation between the two spacecraft or between the Apollo 11 and the ground for the remainder of this pass - try to ascertain the status onboard as far as transferring the crew and other items back into the Command Module. The cleanup in the LM getting all the items dusted off prior to bringing them back in the Command Module. At 128 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, standing by, this is Apollo Control.
128:20:03|T|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
128:20:07|T|LMP|Go ahead.
128:20:08|T|CMP|My hatch is removed. You can open yours, and I'll start passing stuff up to you.
128:20:12|T|LMP|Okay.
128:20:22|T|CMP|No. Stand by one, first.
128:20:27|T|LMP|Okay.
128:28:30|T|LMP|Mike, you ...
128:28:32|T|CMP|Yes, everything is going fine. Be with you in just a second.
128:30:10|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Over.
128:30:16|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston, Eagle here.
128:30:17|T|CC|Roger. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. Over.
128:30:34|T|LMP|Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?
128:30:47|T|LMP|No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.
128:30:58|T|CC|Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the Command Module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.
128:31:24|T|LMP|Roger.
128:32:05|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
128:32:10|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.
128:32:11|T|CC|Roger. All we are trying to do is get PGNS and AGS aligned together. Doesn't make any difference on the gimbal angle.
128:32:28|T|CDR|...
128:32:34|T|LMP|Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?
128:32:38|T|CC|Eagle, that's beautiful.
128:32:44|T|LMP|Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.
128:32:56|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.
128:33:08|T|LMP|Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.
128:33:22|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. That's fine.
128:36:31|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high-gain or anything like that?
128:36:38|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. I can give you some REACQ angles for the high-gain on the LM jettison attitude. Then you can go there whenever you want to. The angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero.
128:37:02|T|CMP|Okay.
128:38:07|T|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Say again the jettison roll, pitch, and yaw, please.
128:38:22|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roll zero, pitch 025, and yaw zero. Over.
128:38:36|T|CMP|Roger. Understand roll zero, pitch 025, yaw zero.
128:38:40|T|CC|That's affirmative.
128:39:13|T|CMP|... in progress. We've moving. Houston.
128:40:09|T|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Over.
128:40:12|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Go.
128:40:18|T|LMP|Roger. It doesn't appear as though the red hose is going to be much of a competitor to the leading vacuum cleaner brands. Over.
128:40:27|T|CC|There's a little noise there, Buzz. Say again.
128:41:54|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
128:42:02|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.
128:42:05|T|CC|Roger. Just a reminder to be sure to zero the AGS errors before you enable the AGS attitude hold there after you get in burn attitude.
128:42:26|T|LMP|Roger. You mean SEP attitude?
128:42:47|T|CMP|Houston, how do you read Columbia on high-gain now?
128:42:50|T|CC|Hey, Columbia. Houston. Mighty fine; loud and clear.
128:42:56|T|CMP|Same here, Ron. Thanks.
128:43:00|T|CC|And Eagle, Houston. Your steerable antenna angles for jettison attitude are - Over.
128:43:22|T|CDR|Roger. Go ahead.
128:43:23|T|CC|Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68. Over.
128:43:35|T|CDR|Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68.
128:43:38|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. Correct.
128:45:07|T|CC|Columbia, Houston.
128:45:13|T|CMP|Columbia. Go ahead.
128:45:15|T|CC|Roger, Mike. You want to tweak the O2 flow up just a bit there?
128:45:22|T|CMP|Okay. Coming up. Houston, do you have any preferences as to what you want us to do with the probe? Over.
128:45:36|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.
128:45:43|T|CMP|Okay. Eagle says they've got a place for it inside there, so no problem.
128:45:48|T|CC|Roger. That's all we were assuming.
128:46:50|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
128:47:06|T|CDR|Eagle. Go ahead.
128:47:07|T|CC|Roger. Neil, it looks like your steerable's good. You can put your track mode to slew and high bit rate, please. Over.
128:47:19|T|CDR|Okay. Track mode to slew and high bit rate.
128:47:48|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by just one, please.
128:48:24|T|CMP|Okay. Shoot them on down.
128:49:28|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
128:49:35|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
128:49:36|T|CC|Roger. Neil, just a reminder again, the ACA out of detent to zero; the AGS out of there just in case you go to ATTITUDE HOLD shortly.
128:49:47|T|CDR|Okay.
128:50:20|T|CMP|You say you wanted the probe now?
128:53:46|T|CC|Eagle, Houston.
128:53:53|T|CDR|Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
128:53:54|T|CC|Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.
128:54:12|T|CDR|Say again, please.
128:54:14|T|CC|Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.
128:54:23|T|CDR|Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.
128:54:28|T|CC|That's okay. That's good.
128:54:39|T|CDR|And I thought I'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if I could get 000 gone, since we're fairly close to gimbal lock right now.
128:54:56|T|CC|Eagle, Houston. That's fine.
128:56:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon on the 27th revolution. The signal from the passive seismometer, which was left on the Moon by the crew of Eagle, was lost for 30 minutes beginning about 5 minutes before Eagle took off this morning. The signal was lost because of a equipment problem that the Canary Island tracking station. The Seismic equipment is back on line now, and is beginning to record lunar day surface temperatures. The dust detector recorded zero dust after Eagle lift off. The laser ground station have not yet acquired a return signal from the Laser Ranging Retro Reflector. Five minutes away from loss of signal with Apollo 11. We will continue to monitor the air-to-ground as the spacecraft goes over the hill. The crew now is engaged in the decontamination procedures inside the Lunar Module prior to transferring back into the Command Module.
128:56:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 went around the back side of the Moon on the 27th rev. We'll have acquisition with Apollo 11 approximately 45 minutes from now. At - Let's see - Would you believe they don't have the next tables up for the next rev. At any rate, 45 minutes from now, and at 129 hours 4 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
128:58:03|T|CC|Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jet time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.
128:58:25|T|CMP|Stand by one.
128:58:43|T|CMP|Could you read it around the next time around, please?
128:58:47|T|CC|Sure, Mike. That's fine. We'll get it to you then.
129:01:52|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. About a minute and a half to LOS. You're looking great. It's been a mighty fine day.
129:02:02|T|CMP|Boy, you're not kidding.
129:04:08|O|LMP|Now, here are a couple of bags - and I think it's self-explanatory what goes in them.
129:04:14|O|CDR|Yes.
129:04:18|O|LMP|... water.
129:04:41|O|LMP|Now, where are those things?
129:04:44|O|CDR|They're at the over ...
129:04:55|O|LMP|Maybe I could slide out of here ...
129:05:20|O|LMP|Hey, Michael, you all tied up there?
129:05:25|O|CMP|...
129:05:27|O|LMP|Get ready for those million-dollar boxes. Got a lot of weight; now, watch it.
129:05:52|O|CMP|You intend to keep ...?
129:05:57|O|CDR|Yes.
129:06:14|O|LMP|That's all your input, are you sure?
129:06:17|O|CMP|Yes.
129:06:18|O|LMP|Okay.
129:06:32|O|LMP|Use what?
129:06:34|O|CDR|Use lithium hydroxide.
129:07:06|O|CDR|That thing still doesn't fit. No, they didn't fix it.
129:07:10|O|LMP|Huh?
129:07:11|O|CDR|They didn't fix it. I had thought somebody had mentioned it, at least.
129:07:19|O|LMP|...
129:07:20|O|CDR|What?
129:07:21|O|LMP|...
129:07:24|O|CDR|Get some tape.
129:07:26|O|LMP|Yes.
129:07:29|O|CDR|Still got some here?
129:07:30|O|LMP|Yes.
129:07:31|O|CMP|...
129:07:35|O|CDR|Okay.
129:08:54|O|CDR|Do you want to vacuum off any of those – those ... spills or anything?
129:09:07|O|LMP|Well, that's ...
129:09:22|O|CDR|Oh, the tape, I guess.
129:09:25|O|LMP|Want tape?
129:09:26|O|CDR|Yes, please.
129:09:27|O|LMP|Here you are.
129:10:35|O|LMP|About how many pictures did you take with – the closeup camera?
129:10:39|O|CDR|I don't know; 30 maybe, 40?
129:10:56|O|LMP|I hope I took the thing apart correctly.
129:11:03|O|CDR|Push the cutter bar down first?
129:11:05|O|LMP|Yes.
129:11:07|O|CDR|It's all right, then.
129:11:29|O|CDR|How are you doing?
129:11:32|O|CMP|Can't hear you.
129:11:33|O|CDR|(Laughter) Well, that stuff can't ... tell; think of Bobby ...
129:11:42|O|LMP|Say, you did get a couple of hard ones in there, didn't you?
129:11:46|O|CDR|Yes.
129:12:15|O|LMP|I guess we leave this here or do you want to take it up?
129:12:19|O|CDR|I'd leave that here.
129:12:22|O|LMP|That might be a little hard to explain.
129:12:24|O|CDR|Yes.
129:12:42|O|CMP|Hey, Neil?
129:12:43|O|CDR|Yes?
129:12:44|O|CMP|...
129:12:53|O|CDR|Okay.
129:12:54|O|CMP|... get rid of this ...
129:12:58|O|CDR|Okay. If you want to have a look at what the moon looks like, you can open that up and look. Don't open the bag, though.
129:13:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 129 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 36 minutes 40 seconds from coming around the other side of the Moon for reacquisition on the 28th revolution. We're nearing the end of the 27th revolution at this time. On the backside of the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin should be involved in preparing for transferring back to the Command Module with Mike Collins, and they'll be cleaning up equipment and vacuuming off any particles of dust that remain before transferring to the Command Module. About 15 minutes after we reacquire we would expect Neil Armstrong to be ready for the transfer to the Command Module. Buzz Aldrin to follow along behind about 30 or 40 minutes later. Here in Mission Control we're presently completing the shift change. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Glenn Lunney, and the Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. The change-of-shift briefing is scheduled to occur in the news center at 6 p.m. Central Daylight Time. At 129 hours, 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
129:13:26|O|CMP|...
129:13:29|O|CDR|You'd never have guessed, huh? (Laughter)
129:14:00|O|CDR|What did you do with that checklist?
129:14:03|O|LMP|It's back yonder.
129:14:05|O|CDR|What?
129:14:07|O|LMP|It's behind the hatch.
129:14:17|O|CMP|What was that bag ...?
129:14:20|O|CDR|Contingency sample.
129:14:23|O|CMP|Rock?
129:14:25|O|CDR|Yes, there's some rocks in it, too. You can feel them, but you can't see them; they're covered with that - graphite.
129:14:39|O|CMP|... compared to -
129:14:45|O|CDR|Looks like powdered graphite to me.
129:14:46|O|LMP|Say, you got a screwdriver, Mike?
129:14:48|O|CMP|Yes.
129:14:50|O|LMP|Yes?
129:14:51|O|CMP|Yes, I guess I have; just a second.
129:14:53|O|CDR|You know, that - that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back – LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself; we'll have to figure something out for it.
129:15:16|O|LMP|Ouch! Alright, here's your checklist.
129:16:36|O|LMP|You vacuum all this stuff?
129:16:41|O|CDR|Which?
129:16:42|O|LMP|Gloves, lunar stuff?
129:16:46|O|CDR|...
129:17:05|O|LMP|Okay. It looks to me like - what we're going to do is vacuum you out and get you out of here. I'll - throw the switches down there.
129:17:16|O|CDR|How about the data bag?
129:17:18|O|LMP|No, I need this bag.
129:17:20|O|CDR|Well, I've got one here. I'll go try to get some more - when I go over. Okay?
129:17:26|O|LMP|Okay. Give me the vacuum tube.
129:17:38|O|CDR|Let me get my back to you first.
129:19:02|O|LMP|Need a PPK.
129:19:05|O|CDR|Huh? I guess they're in here. PPK's?
129:19:20|O|LMP|I guess they're over here.
129:19:51|O|CDR|..., you know? (Laughter)
129:19:54|O|LMP|Get your circuit breakers pushed, AUDIO control circuit breakers?
129:20:06|O|CMP|...
129:21:13|O|CMP|How are you doing?
129:21:16|O|LMP|It's filthy.
129:21:18|O|CMP|Does all this stuff come in here?
129:22:09|O|CDR|Well, I guess that ought to do it.
129:22:20|O|LMP|Okay.
129:26:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 28
129:26:13|O|CDR|...
129:26:14|O|LMP|Yes.
129:26:15|O|CDR|...
129:26:17|O|LMP|Just a minute.
129:26:36|O|LMP|Say, I need some of those data books.
129:27:59|O|LMP|Where did you put the book? Where did you put the first one? In here? Okay.
129:28:28|O|CDR|...
129:28:33|O|LMP|No, we can leave those two here. No, I don't want either of those two. No, I think the others might be -
129:28:55|O|CDR|... we leave these bags here.
129:28:59|O|LMP|Okay.
129:29:18|O|LMP|Hey, have you been over it, Mike?
129:29:21|O|CMP|... really ...
129:29:31|O|LMP|How about calling them and asking them for – if those angles are still good? Right at lock-lock with them?
129:29:43|O|CMP|... last time ...
129:29:47|O|LMP|Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
129:50:55|T|CC|Hello, Eagle. Houston. Do you read? Over.
129:51:02|T|CDR|Houston, this is Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. We're all three back inside; the hatch is installed. We're running a pressure check leak check. Everything's going well.
129:51:11|T|CC|Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch. We had a couple of things for you.
129:51:25|T|CDR|What are they?
129:51:26|T|CC|Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO2 sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all. Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.
129:51:54|T|CDR|Buzz says the CO2 sensor circuit breaker is IN
129:51:58|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much.
129:52:09|T|CDR|The RCS quantity was approximately 60 at A and 45 percent at B.
129:52:14|T|CC|Roger.
129:52:19|T|CDR|And we're going P00 in ACCEPT.
129:52:21|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
129:54:07|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Your friendly White Team's going to be on till we get you on the way home, and we'd like to congratulate everybody on a successful rendezvous and a beautiful EVA. It was a great show for everybody. Over.
129:54:25|T|CMP|Thank you, sir. I'll tell Neil and Buzz.
129:54:39|T|CDR|Houston, the hatch passes its integrity check. I'm going to go to LM tunnel VENT now, and leave it there.
129:54:47|T|CC|Roger, Colualbia. We copy. That's good, and we'd like a readout on the TEP of about the time you - that Eagle selected the secondary loop. Over.
129:55:05|T|CDR|Stand by.
129:55:17|T|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. We got the load in. You can do the VERB 66 and the computer is yours. Over.
129:55:24|T|CDR|Roger.
129:56:01|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. Over.
129:56:11|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Columbia. Thank you very much.
129:57:20|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.
129:57:41|T|CMP|That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.
129:57:49|T|CC|Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.
129:58:13|T|CMP|Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the Flight Plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.
129:58:20|T|CC|Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.
129:58:41|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.
129:58:56|T|CMP|Roger.
130:02:13|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
130:02:19|T|CMP|Go ahead.
130:02:21|T|CC|Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.
130:02:46|T|CMP|Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.
130:02:48|T|CC|Roger.
130:04:34|T|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend picking up page F11 - 12 and we'd like to jettison at 10 minutes. That'll be 130 14 45. Over.
130:04:54|T|CMP|Right.
130:04:57|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. If that's not satisfactory, let us know. Over.
130:05:05|T|CMP|Right.
130:05:36|T|CDR|Houston, Columbia. How about a GO for logic BUS ARM.
130:05:40|T|CC|Stand by.
130:05:48|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You've got a GO.
130:05:55|T|CDR|Thank you.
130:06:46|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. You can undock at your convenience, correction, jettison at your convenience. We would like you to jettison Eagle and stationkeep - in P47 and stationkeep, and we'll have another attitude and a maneuver for you so we'll be okay for TEI. Over.
130:07:08|T|CDR|Roger that.
130:07:45|T|CMP|And I'm standing by to go to P47 just as soon as you give me a go for PYRO ARM.
130:07:49|T|CC|Roger. I thought we gave you that. Mike, you're GO for PYRO ARM and you're GO for jettison.
130:07:57|T|CMP|Okay.
130:09:13|T|CMP|Okay. Let her go in 10 seconds.
130:09:15|T|CC|Copy. Out.
130:09:40|T|CMP|NOUN 83 reading minus four balls, minus three balls, 3 or - correction - minus - both register 1 and register 2 are reading minus four balls 3, register 3 is zeros, the EMS remained on 100.0. A fairly loud noise, and it appears to be departing - oh, I would guess several feet per second.
130:10:06|T|CC|Roger, can you kind of stationkeep with it, Mike? Just stand by now.
130:10:12|T|CMP|Will do.
130:10:23|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.
130:10:32|T|LMP|Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?
130:10:35|T|CC|Say again, Buzz. Over.
130:10:37|T|LMP|Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?
130:10:52|T|CC|Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.
130:11:05|T|CDR|There she goes. It was a good one.
130:11:08|T|CC|Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.
130:11:19|T|LMP|I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.
130:11:35|T|CC|Roger.
130:12:43|T|CC|Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.
130:12:56|T|CMP|That's fine.
130:16:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 16 minutes. We reacquired Apollo 11 about 25 minutes ago, at 129 51. At that time Mike Collins reported that all 3 crewmen were in the Command Module. The transfer occurring while the spacecraft were on the back side of the Moon. They had closed out the LM early and had transferred to the second coolant loop. That decision was made in Mission Control because the secondary loop was on, the primary loop disabled in the close out process. We did not want to have the LM docked to the CSM for an undue length of time, because the primary guidance system is not cooled. The decision was initially made to jettison the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, however the crew continued ahead of schedule. They were ready to jettison ahead of that time, and Collins reported at 130 10 about, 17 minutes ago, that they were, had jettisoned the LM and said it had departed at several feet per second, and we heard a comment from Buzz Aldrin, that he noticed some cracks in the thermo covering around the LM tunnel, docking area, however he said it did not appear to be a structural crack but merely some cracks in the thermal covering. We are currently scheduled to perform the small Reaction Control System maneuver with the Command and Service Module for separation from the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, or about 12 minutes from now. We'll pick up this pass as it began on tape and when we've caught up, we'll continue to follow the activity live.
130:16:49|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.
130:17:01|T|CMP|Roger. Pitch 230.
130:17:03|T|CC|Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high-gain.
130:17:15|T|CMP|We're in REACQ. Is that all right?
130:17:17|T|CC|Say again. We need AUTO.
130:17:23|T|CMP|Negative, we're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.
130:17:26|T|CC|Roger. We need AUTO, please, sir.
130:17:31|T|CMP|Okay. You got it.
130:17:42|T|CMP|Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?
130:17:47|T|CC|Right now that's what we're looking at. Stand by. We might have you roll so we can keep the high-gain. Stand by.
130:17:56|T|CMP|Roger.
130:19:05|T|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.
130:19:09|T|CMP|Go ahead.
130:19:10|T|CC|Roger, Mike - -
130:19:11|T|CDR|Apollo 11, these days.
130:19:12|T|CC|Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.
130:19:33|T|CMP|Okay.
130:20:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.
130:21:02|T|CMP|You got it.
130:21:04|T|CC|Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.
130:21:13|T|CMP|Go ahead. Ready to copy.
130:21:14|T|CC|Roger. Starting with NOUN 33: 130 30 0000, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VP 00020, burn time 007, DELTA-VC 00020. We have - The rest of the PAD is NA.
130:22:15|T|CMP|Roger. GET 130 hours 30 minutes, DELTA-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, DELTA-VC, 2.0.
130:22:32|T|CC|That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.
130:24:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.
130:24:19|T|CMP|Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?
130:24:39|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.
130:24:58|T|CMP|Understand.
130:25:50|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.
130:26:12|T|CMP|Okay.
130:30:26|T|CMP|Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.
130:30:38|T|CC|Copy, Apollo 11. Looks good to us. Over.
130:30:43|T|CMP|Okay.
130:33:24|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with a good communications attitude for us to go to between now and the time we maneuver at TEI attitude.
130:33:33|T|CC|Roger, sir. Stand by.
130:34:40|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.
130:34:46|T|CMP|Go ahead.
130:34:47|T|CC|Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the Flight Plan, and the high-gain angles are good as shown in the Flight Plan, and we'd like you to dump the wastewater at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.
130:35:13|T|CMP|Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a wastewater dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.
130:35:28|T|CC|That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.
130:36:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 46 minutes. That Command Module separation, maneuver, which occurred at 130 hours 30 minutes, was a 2 foot per second retrograde burn. Burn duration was 7 seconds. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that at transearth injection, which is scheduled to occur as per the Flight Plan, at about 135 hours 25 minutes, and at that time, the CSM will be about 20 miles ahead of the LM and about I mile below.
130:37:10|T|CMP|Maneuver is in progress, Houston.
130:37:14|T|CC|Copy, 11. Out.
130:40:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
130:46:46|T|CMP|Apollo 11 under high-gain. How do you read?
130:46:50|T|CC|Five by, 11. How me? Over.
130:46:54|T|CMP|You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?
130:47:05|T|CC|That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.
130:47:26|T|CMP|That's what we're looking for.
130:47:27|T|CC|Roger.
130:47:39|T|CC|11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.
130:47:52|T|CMP|Thank you, Charlie.
130:47:57|T|CC|And your little maneuver back here a moment ago will put you about 20 miles ahead of the LM at TEI.
130:48:07|T|CMP|Okay.
130:48:42|T|CMP|Imagine that place has cleared out a little bit after that rendezvous. You can find a place to sit down almost, huh?
130:48:47|T|CC|Roger. Our MOCR's about empty right now. We're taking it a little easy. How does it feel up there to have some company?
130:48:57|T|CMP|Damn good, I'll tell you.
130:49:00|T|CC|I'll bet. I bet, you'd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 REVS or so.
130:49:07|T|CMP|No, no. It's a happy home here. It'd be nice to have company. As a matter of fact, it'd be nice to have a couple of hundred million Americans up here.
130:49:18|T|CC|Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit.
130:49:19|T|CMP|Let them see what they're getting for their money.
130:49:22|T|CC|Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many. We heard on the news today, 11, that last night - yesterday after you made your landing, New York Times came out with a - headlines, the largest headlines they've ever used in the history of the newspaper.
130:49:48|T|CMP|Save us a copy.
130:49:55|T|CDR|I'm glad to hear it was fit to print.
130:49:59|T|CC|It was great.
130:50:08|T|CC|That's why we didn't read you up any newscast. There really wasn't anything to talk about.
130:50:15|T|CMP|Hello, there, Boss.
130:51:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point or pericynthian of 54.9. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 5 thousand 3 hundred 55 feet per second. We will reacquire the spacecraft in a little over 45 minutes on the 21st revolution. At 131 hours 3 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
130:51:36|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We've got 10 minutes to LOS; see you over the hill at 131 48. Over.
130:51:45|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll dump the water as soon as we go around the corner.
130:51:48|T|CC|Roger. Everything's looking real good now.
130:51:53|T|CMP|Yes. Same here.
130:57:08|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Coming up about 4 30 LOS. You're looking great on all your systems. Eagle is purring right along after an hour 30 without any cooling. The PNGS is still looking good. Over.
130:57:24|T|CMP|Roger.
131:00:26|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Will you verify that your rendezvous radar transponder is off? Over.
131:00:26|O|CC|...
131:00:34|O|LMP|It's not, but I'll get it off.
131:00:36|O|CDR|Okay.
131:00:38|T|CMP|It's not, but I'll get it off.
131:00:41|T|CC|Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar, and that was the only theory that we had. It looked like it was a good one.
131:00:41|O|CC|Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar - -
131:00:48|O|LMP|What do you do with it?
131:00:49|O|CC|- - and that was the only theory that we had - it looked like it was a good one.
131:00:52|O|LMP|Hey - what do you do with it?
131:00:54|O|CMP|Just turn it down to off.
131:00:55|T|CMP|Good theory.
131:00:56|O|LMP|This goes off - -
131:00:57|O|CMP|No, no, no, no, that's not the one - it's this switch right next to that IMU - -
131:01:00|O|LMP|Oh.
131:01:01|O|CMP|- - Buzz. Okay, that one, just turn it to – turn it to position 1 - extreme left; that one. There you go. Thank you.
131:01:18|O|LMP|I thought you were going to be doing VHF RANGING on the darn thing because we had it set up for - VHF ...
131:01:24|O|CMP|I don't know where ... other than that.
131:01:31|O|LMP|That was to - -
131:01:35|O|CMP|You ought to check the Flight Plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue. It says I remove my hatch, and then I notify you that you're clear to open your hatch.
131:01:49|O|CMP|Huh?
131:01:58|O|LMP|Oh, no.
131:01:59|O|CMP|So, that's just the contingency.
131:02:04|O|LMP|No, negative.
131:02:06|O|CMP|That's the contingency.
131:02:08|O|LMP|We move the drogue there. ...
131:02:11|O|CMP|We've got to reach down and grab that extension handle and all that good stuff.
131:02:26|O|LMP|That was alright, we understand.
131:02:47|O|CDR|Yes.
131:03:09|O|CMP|Damn! My ears hurt from wearing this thing.
131:03:15|O|LMP|How are the earpieces - inside ...
131:03:22|O|CMP|...
131:03:24|O|LMP|...
131:03:26|O|CMP|Yes, I hate those damn ...
131:03:28|O|LMP|Yes, they're not - ...
131:03:32|O|CDR|Yes. I believe - Did you hear any noise during - you didn't hear any noise during descent, did you? ...
131:03:38|O|CMP|...
131:03:39|O|CDR|How about during lift-off?
131:03:41|O|CMP|...
131:03:46|O|CMP|How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?
131:03:48|O|LMP|Well, there was a little - little blast – then we started moving; then we could see all those - -
131:03:56|O|CMP|... were you very stable; I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?
131:04:01|O|LMP|- - The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by ... - it was about - at lift-off - maybe - half a g or two-thirds of a g.
131:04:25|O|CMP|Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.
131:04:38|O|LMP|Yes it was - -
131:04:43|O|CMP|But it's pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn't really come up and engulf you, huh?
131:04:48|O|LMP|All the stuff looks like very light tan and gray, you know, that's - that's the color of it. When you get right up there to it, when you see it, why that isn't the color at all.
131:05:01|O|CMP|Dark - battleship gray, isn't it?
131:05:05|O|LMP|Maybe not - I don't know - -
131:05:08|O|CMP|Well, what kind of - -
131:05:09|O|LMP|- - what stuck to the spacecraft, I think you can see afterwards - -
131:05:12|O|CMP|What do you think it is from the - geology standpoint, is it basalt dust?
131:05:19|O|CDR|...
131:05:21|O|CMP|Well, do the rocks - do the rocks all look the same? They're different - good, great; I'm glad to hear it.
131:05:28|O|LMP|There's really a tremendous -
131:05:42|O|LMP|Little sparkly stuff; quite a bit of it all over.
131:05:46|O|CMP|I'll be damned; I'm glad - I'm glad it wasn't just - -
131:05:48|O|MS|...
131:05:50|O|LMP|Yes, is that right?
131:05:59|O|CMP|Luckily, you were able to get a little bit of everything. I mean, were the rocks - I mean, how did you - did you go around and - just pick up rocks, put them in - in - -
131:06:08|O|LMP|We were kind of rushed, if that's what you mean.
131:06:15|O|CMP|Yes.
131:06:24|O|CDR|...
131:06:25|O|CMP|Great, great. Yes, it's - beautiful. Man, that's beautiful. It doesn't make a dip whether ... and all that, I mean you know, they mapped the area and all that - -
131:06:38|O|LMP|Eventually, it does - -
131:06:40|O|CMP|Huh?
131:06:41|O|LMP|Well, eventually, it does - it shows the ... - you can see those - ...
131:06:54|O|CMP|That's great; fantastic! That'll keep those geologists jumping for years.
131:07:00|O|LMP|Yes, you got to keep ... No, that's right, you got a 6-foot pole, you just stick ... - -
131:07:07|O|CMP|Sort of like wet sand - -
131:07:08|O|LMP|- - about that far.
131:07:09|O|CMP|Is that right? I don't know. I'm inclined to ...
131:07:17|O|CDR|... Is this yours?
131:07:59|O|CMP|You yawed right 13 degrees? What's nominal?
131:08:05|O|CDR|Yaw left 13 degrees.
131:08:08|O|CMP|Ah so, ah so.
131:08:32|O|CDR|I guess the main thing on this stowage is to make sure it's reasonable for the g's we'll get during TEI and sometime on the way home we can get everything all squared away for ...
131:08:46|O|CMP|No, I'm in no rush. Go ahead - go ahead and get everything all packed away; I hate to have – a couple of suits out. If you want to air it for a while, go ahead and get the hose to it, and - I'm in no rush. I'll take this thing off after you guys are done there.
131:09:20|O|CDR|...
131:09:30|O|CMP|Yes. Is that right?
131:09:44|O|CMP|You finally got it level, huh? What was that thing that you said it was supposed to be concave but it was convex?
131:09:50|O|LMP|...
131:09:53|O|CMP|Yes, yes.
131:10:01|O|LMP|... looking down there ... sure looked like it was convex ... Neil walked back a little later and it was right smack in the middle ... - -
131:10:29|O|CMP|But there's all different kinds of rocks, huh, or at least several different kinds? Well, how - -
131:10:32|O|LMP|- - ...
131:10:41|O|CMP|Well, did - when you look - when you're walking around or just looking out the window of the LM, did it appear very homogeneous? Everything sort of the same color and all, or did it look ...?
131:10:56|O|LMP|...
131:10:58|O|CMP|It's that dark battleship gray like?
131:11:01|O|LMP|When you looked down sun, it's very tan, very tan.
131:11:03|O|CDR|...
131:11:14|O|CMP|When you looked down sun, it looks almost white, just a reflection from the sun.
131:11:21|O|LMP|Well, ... as it goes out ... while on Earth it gets ... in the atmosphere ... - -
131:11:27|O|CMP|Yes.
131:11:28|O|LMP|- - ... that might be indicative of why ... - -
131:11:51|O|CMP|Yes.
131:12:03|O|CMP|Neil, when you get a hand, would you push that little goddam valve down to DUMP? Never mind, never mind.
131:12:14|O|CDR|... be sure and get the right one ... - -
131:12:20|O|CMP|It's the lower valve on the lower panel – lower left; that guy right there. Yes, that guy right there; put him down to DUMP. Dump's easy, fine; set the clock.
131:13:08|O|CDR|...
131:13:10|O|LMP|Here's one.
131:13:12|O|CMP|... for the hoses? Well, check the ends of the hoses.
131:13:22|O|CMP|Well, why don't you leave the vacuum cleaner; I think you just got ... now the other one - -
131:13:29|O|LMP|No, this one's got ...
131:13:31|O|CDR|Okay. Now the one I got is for my hose over here which doesn't have -
131:13:55|O|CMP|How big are the rocks that you just scurried around and picked up with the tongs? Good gravy! Beautiful! Just crack those guys open and get a - you know, virgin interior of them in a vacuum, and they'll have a ball. ...
131:14:19|O|CMP|Hey, the Velcro - the Velcro around them sort of ...
131:14:35|O|CMP|Huh?
131:14:37|O|CDR|I said, this is my field geology ...
131:14:40|O|CMP|Right.
131:14:49|O|CDR|...
131:15:10|O|CMP|We could move - we could move that bag - it's no big thing, we can move the bag. Don't worry about it; we're going to leave it this way for TEI, right? Might as well.
131:15:28|O|CDR|...
131:15:32|O|CMP|Good day, I don't know. It's - I tell you, it's not a bad way to live, with that couch in there - I sort of - oh, yes, I agree; we can put two up and one down - ...
131:15:53|O|LMP|...
131:16:08|O|CMP|Yes, we could put the couch up now if you want to do that.
131:16:14|O|LMP|Okay.
131:16:15|O|CMP|Yes. Maybe it - maybe it would make more sense to put the couch up now. Why don't you let me wrestle with the couch before we do anything more to this damn poor L-shaped bag?
131:16:26|O|LMP|...
131:16:29|O|CMP|Alright. And we're - we're LOS here for a while anyway, 131 -
131:16:54|O|CMP|Here's about where we are, ... Yes, this is the handiest little thing you've ever seen. ... goes right in the helmet side, won't come out, and you can grab hold of anything you want, and there it is, it won't ...
131:17:08|O|LMP|(Laughter) ...
131:17:42|O|SC|(Yawn)
131:20:23|O|CMP|... all this little stuff ...
131:21:42|O|LMP|... is this optional - sort of - ...? Huh?
131:21:54|O|CMP|No, optional ...
131:22:11|O|CMP|No, no, this is - used for the intervalometer?
131:22:17|O|LMP|...
131:24:27|O|CDR|... might have some layers on the wall of that crater. It just occurred to me that - that's got to be the result of ... of some sort ...
131:25:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 29
131:28:02|O|CDR|... is looking good.
131:28:05|O|LMP|Think so.
131:28:12|O|CDR|A little more.
131:28:26|O|CMP|You got to do what, Neil?
131:29:27|O|CDR|I don't think it's harder to ... than it is – at orbital speeds. ... There just isn't any way really of ... altitude - or the size of this thing.
131:29:59|O|CMP|We're in INERTIAL, aren't we?
131:30:10|O|CDR|No, you want to go to INERTIAL?
131:34:35|O|CMP|I wonder if Neil has made any preparations?
131:35:29|O|CDR|What's your altitude?
131:35:34|O|CMP|...
131:35:52|O|CDR|I guess we could put - ... to ...
131:37:25|O|LMP|Hey, Neil, I think this - this does have something ...
131:37:30|O|CDR|Alright.
131:37:35|O|LMP|... Now it's on the other side. No, down, down ...
131:39:18|O|LMP|What did you have on ...?
131:39:24|O|CMP|No, that side. Yes, it was down to 3. He called 30 seconds at one time.
131:39:32|O|LMP|Yes, ...
131:39:38|O|CMP|Yes, he called 60 seconds; then I heard him call 30 seconds.
131:40:15|O|CMP|Yes.
131:40:16|O|LMP|... I got it, thank you.
131:40:21|O|CMP|Well, it's held under that forward-velocity unit.
131:40:46|O|CMP|How's that?
131:41:05|O|CMP|With the ..., I don't see how you can -
131:41:19|O|CDR|Leaving on your ... in here?
131:41:26|O|CMP|I think - you had that same pair on all the time.
131:41:57|O|CDR|Is that the ... - sitting there?
131:42:05|O|CMP|Yes, here it is.
131:42:06|O|CDR|Let me put it down here. Bring it on down. Over here. Put them all in one place.
131:42:30|O|CDR|You ready for your underwear? Mike - you ready for your underwear? You ready for your underwear?
131:42:43|O|CMP|Just a minute; yes.
131:42:54|O|LMP|... - put our - LCG.
131:42:59|O|CDR|Yes.
131:43:10|O|CMP|Somehow we'll figure a way to ...
131:45:22|O|CDR|2 feet per second.
131:45:46|O|LMP|You didn't maintain that 3-1/2 feet per second down there.
131:45:51|O|CDR|(Laughing)
131:45:56|O|LMP|Well, I hope - I hope they have the data that shows just what we did have at contact when they can get photographs ... all the film we got.
131:46:14|O|CDR|Yes.
131:46:19|O|LMP|Well, I really couldn't put the ... no place, not that I'm sure of it, but my light came on, why, ... hit.
131:47:18|O|CDR|Yes, that's sure - the way that thing was working - the way that thing was working and stayed locked on all the way down - Gees, it was a beautiful thing.
131:47:44|O|CDR|You mean you didn't ...?
131:47:53|O|LMP|Getting all the damn alarms.
131:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 48 minutes. We're standing by to reacquire Apollo - Apollo 11. Acquisition should come in about 5 seconds. This revolution should be relatively quiet. We don't have a great deal of activity scheduled. The crew may have time to get something to eat, and here on the ground we will be computing the information needed for their transearth injection burn. We do have data now from the spacecraft. We'll standby for a call to the crew.
131:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We suspect the crew is having something to eat at this time which probably accounts for the relatively quiet period. One of the things that we are watching with interest here in Mission Control is the Lunar Module. At the time Aldrin and Armstrong left the LM and came back into the Service Module, they switched over to the secondary cooling loop as part of a test that we are running to determine just how long the primary guidance and navigation system will last without cooling. The primary guidance system is not cooled on the secondary loop which provides backup cooling for the secondary guidance system and it has always been a point of interest as to just how long the primary guidance system will survive without cooling - estimates range up to several hours. The LM TEL COMM Controller reports that at this time we are seeing some rise in the PIPAS. These are the Pulse Integrating Pendulum - Pendulous Accelerometers which - the primary guidance system uses to detect changes in motion and attitude and of course they are an essential item in the - the primary guidance system. We are seeing a gradual rise in temperature but the TEL COMM engineer reports that the primary guidance system still looks very good. At the time the crew reported they were back that Armstrong and Aldrin reported that they were back in the Command Module, we asked them what time they did switch over to the secondary loop. Armstrong estimated that that occurred about 129 hours 40 minutes which was a little over 2 hours ago. We will continue to monitor the LM and to observe the performance of the primary guidance system. All systems on the command Service Module continue to function very well at this time and the same can be said for the Lunar Module. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in a orbit 62.5 nautical miles by 54.2. The spacecraft traveling at a speed of 5349 feet per second.
131:48:06|O|LMP|Boy, I thought for a while there that some of those might get a little ... - ... I'd reset the program alarm in time for a ... out of there.
131:49:29|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here. Over.
131:49:42|T|LMP|Apollo 11. Roger.
131:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 15 minutes. We have some preliminary figures on the transearth injection maneuver scheduled to occur about 3 hours, 8 minutes from now. The time of ignition is - stand by just a moment. The time of ignition would be 135 hours, 23 minutes 41 seconds.
132:16:00|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.
132:16:09|T|CDR|Be pleased to have it.
132:16:11|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."
132:17:21|T|CC|And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.
132:18:00|T|CC|You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."
132:18:52|T|CC|In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.
132:19:21|T|CC|Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.
132:21:22|T|CDR|Thank you much, Charlie.
132:21:24|T|CC|You're welcome.
132:21:42|T|CC|11, Houston. We've got a preliminary TEI 30 PAD, if you're ready to copy.
132:22:06|T|CMP|Ready to copy.
132:22:10|T|CC|Roger. Coming at you. TEI 30, SPS/G&N: 36691; minus 061, plus 067 135 23 4149; NOUN 81, plus 32020, plus 06713, minus 02773 181 054 013; NOUN 44, HA is NA, plus 00230 32833 228, DELTA VC 32625 24 1510 355. Next three lines are NA. NOUN 61 plus 1103, minus - minus 17237 11806 36275 195 04 52. Your set stars are Deneb and Vega, 242 172 012. We like two jet ullage to 16 seconds. The horizon will be on the 11 degree mark at TIG minus 2 minutes. And other comments: your sextant star is visible after GET of 134 50. Ready for your readback. Over.
132:24:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 29 minutes. That last string of numbers read up to the spacecraft included the information the crew will need to start them on their way back to Earth in about 2 hours, 54 minutes. The time of ignition for the transearth injection burn again is 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. They will burn their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes, 28 seconds and increasing their speed by 3283 feet per second. And our preliminary estimate is that that will put them into the Pacific Ocean at the primary landing site at 195 hours, 18 minutes, 47 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time, or almost precisely on the Flight Plan. The spacecraft weight at the time they do the transearth injection burn will be 36,691 pounds. We'll continue to stand by for any communication from the spacecraft. We now have about 29 minutes, 30 seconds until the Apollo 11 goes around the corner and behind the Moon out of radio contact.
132:24:39|T|CMP|Roger. We have a TEI 30, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 061, plus 067 135 23 4149; plus 32020, plus 06713, minus 02773 181 054 013; NA, plus 00230, plus 32833 228 32625, 24 1510 355; NA three times, plus 1103, minus 17237 11806 36275 195 04 52. Deneb and Vega 242 172 012, two jet ullage, 16 seconds; horizon 11 degree line at TIG minus 2 minutes; sextant star visible after 134 50. Over.
132:25:58|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Good readback. Out.
132:39:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now about 30 seconds from loss of signal with Apollo 11 on the 29th revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 46 minutes. As the spacecraft comes around on its 30th revolution, that will be the next to the last full revolution in lunar orbit. The transearth injection maneuver will be performed at the end of the 30th revolution, just after - actually, just after beginning the 31st revolution of the Moon. Apollo 11 is now in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point of 54.2. The current spacecraft velocity is 5,356 feet per second, and we show an orbital weight of 36,691 pounds. We have loss of signal now. We'll be coming back up when we reacquire in about 45 minutes. At 133 hours, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
132:53:02|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Seven minutes to LOS; next AOS 133 46. You're looking good going over the hill. Out.
132:59:10|O|CMP|Will that one do? ...
132:59:48|O|LMP|Are you staying in this inertial attitude? Let's just leave it in REACQ then; it works just like a charm.
132:59:55|O|CMP|Yes, that's right.
133:00:09|O|CDR|How about that?
133:00:55|O|CDR|Beautiful.
133:00:59|O|CMP|405 and 404 - What's the matter with it? (Laughter)
133:01:02|O|LMP|403 I think we ...
133:01:09|O|CMP|... alignment, oops, I got 404 again.
133:01:55|O|CMP|How about that, wise asses! Huh?
133:01:58|O|LMP|You had a - you had to work though, didn't you?
133:03:08|O|CMP|... O2 fuel cell's ....
133:03:17|O|CDR|This is not dumping.
133:03:19|O|CMP|I figured that.
133:03:25|O|CDR|Did you try the other line?
133:03:26|O|CMP|Well - no, I haven't tried a whole number of alternatives. In fact, number 1 is not dumping. My guess would be that it's something to do with this connection in the UCD or something like that. When you try to dump your ... regular urine bag, ... It's so goddam smelly, I hate to grab it and dick around with it, but I guess I got to.
133:03:47|O|CDR|Not entirely. I think I'd rather stick around ...
133:04:40|O|CDR|...
133:05:36|O|LMP|How long does it take to warm up this thing? 3 hours?
133:05:38|O|CMP|...
133:05:46|O|CDR|What state vector is in the LM slot? The LM?
133:05:54|O|LMP|... minus a few feet per second. ...
133:05:59|O|CDR|Well, we got something in the LM slot ...
133:06:03|O|CMP|Well, that's just an old vectors, because I never did VERB 66, I don't think, after ...
133:06:32|O|LMP|We got 22 feet per second. Almost have to be LM - previous to the SEP burn.
133:10:11|O|CDR|Well, when it gets to be light, we got to ...
133:10:19|O|LMP|Well, we probably ought to - ... TPI.
133:10:27|O|CMP|Yes, the maneuver ... right amount of ...
133:11:24|O|CDR|... give me a waste bag ....
133:11:31|O|CMP|Yes, just ... a lot ... there.
133:12:17|O|CMP|It was back here.
133:12:19|O|LMP|Yes.
133:13:03|O|CMP|Who took the roll of tape?
133:13:08|O|CDR|Isn't it in its place? Closet?
133:13:10|O|CMP|No, no, it's not in there. It doesn't have that closet anymore. The last I saw it, it was up on the MDC. I gave it - I handed it to one of you guys to -
133:13:17|O|LMP|Yes, I stuck it someplace.
133:13:25|O|CMP|Let's invent a new home for it because that old home is full of that smelly old urine bag.
133:13:34|O|CDR|The floodlight isn't - hasn't even made the bottom of the package warm yet, fellows.
133:13:39|O|LMP|Well, when it goes up there, we'll have to put it up here.
133:17:10|O|CMP|I got the tape - right underneath your couch. Okay?
133:17:19|O|LMP|Alright.
133:17:25|O|CMP|Okay, we need a new home for the tape. Anybody got any good suggestions?
133:17:36|O|CMP|Okay?
133:17:39|O|LMP|Alright.
133:18:02|O|CMP|We believed you, though.
133:19:29|O|CMP|(Yawn)
133:19:40|O|CDR|...
133:20:05|O|LMP|Go ahead.
133:21:25|O|CDR|I think we had a ...
133:21:44|O|CDR|Not a burn ...
133:21:55|O|CMP|Oh, God, why ... (laughter) ...
133:22:10|O|CDR|... but right now, I am for a nice beer.
133:22:54|O|CDR|..., some water here. Mike, do you remember trying to get water into a grapefruit-pineapple drink?
133:23:00|T||BEGIN LUNAR REV 30
133:23:05|O|CMP|No, don't do it.
133:23:06|O|CDR|Yes.
133:23:07|O|CMP|Don't do it.
133:23:13|O|LMP|Couldn't get it in, huh?
133:23:15|O|CDR|No.
133:23:51|O|CMP|..., Buzz?
133:23:59|O|LMP|... some of that.
133:24:59|O|CMP|There's a piece of that great bread that has mold all over it.
133:26:45|O|LMP|You got the Flight Plan?
133:26:51|O|CDR|...
133:27:05|O|LMP|...
133:27:08|O|CMP|Probably are. I purged them this morning when I woke up, Buzz. Probably did the hydrogen as well.
133:27:16|O|LMP|47, 32, 47?
133:33:37|O|CMP|That was quite a wild gyration for docking.
133:33:40|O|LMP|It was.
133:33:42|O|CMP|Son-of-a-bitching - -
133:33:43|O|LMP|You did a pretty good ...
133:33:49|O|CMP|If I'd known how it was going to develop, I wouldn't have gone as far with the bottle as I did. I was in the habit of it, you know, as soon as contact is made, I look at it. It looks okay, I fire the bottle right away.
133:33:56|O|CDR|...
133:33:57|O|CMP|No, I would.
133:33:58|O|CDR|...
133:33:59|O|CMP|No, no.
133:34:00|O|CDR|...
133:34:01|O|CMP|... No sooner than I fired that goddamned bottle, than wow; and away we went.
133:34:10|O|LMP|...
133:34:32|O|CDR|No - they're way down so, I don't know - just ...
133:34:34|O|CMP|Then, when I fired the bottle, and then, just about all that came ... since the thing started, I went back to CMC, AUTO, ... bothering me. And just about that time all those ..., my God, those flashes ... I thought they were ... I thought we were ...
133:35:10|O|CDR|... I mean later on ... all those ...
133:37:06|O|LMP|Look at this.
133:37:08|O|CDR|Yes.
133:37:09|O|LMP|Figured nobody could see where we were ....
133:38:08|O|CMP|Hey, did we decide the ... back?
133:38:38|O|CMP|No, the data should go to the log ... The only good thing there you can say about it is ...
133:38:55|O|LMP|... you guys. ... love them ...
133:39:51|O|CMP|All that probe and drogue and tunnel and claptrap works; all that EVA transfer, you can forget about that and all those crazy procedures for taking that probe apart.
133:40:12|O|LMP|At least, we can forget them until the debriefing.
133:40:14|O|CMP|Yes (laughter).
133:40:55|O|LMP|...
133:41:23|O|CMP|This thing ... make a great ...
133:42:04|O|CDR|Picked up the CSM problem.
133:42:38|O|CMP|I've never thought about it.
133:42:50|O|CDR|...?
133:42:51|O|CMP|No.
133:42:54|O|LMP|All at once.
133:43:19|O|CDR|None of them.
133:44:31|O|CDR|Yes.
133:44:44|O|CDR|... long time.
133:44:51|O|CMP|It's ...?
133:45:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 133 hours 45 minutes. We're now 50 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the 30th revolution of the Moon. This will be our last front side pass before transearth injection. On this revolution we'll be passing up to the crew the final computations for their transearth injection maneuver, which is scheduled to occur at 135 hours 23 minutes 42 seconds, or about 1 hour 38 minutes from now. We should have acquisition of signal now in about 10 seconds. We'll stand by.
133:45:00|P|PAO|We have acquired the signal from the spacecraft now. We're standing by at this time for a call from the crew or for Capcom Charlie Duke to put in a call to the crew from the ground. We presently show the Lunar Module in an orbit 63.3 by 56 nautical miles, the command Service Module is in an orbit 63.2 by 53.9. At the time of the transearth injection burn we expect that the Command Module will be about 1 mile below the LM and about 20 miles in front of it.
133:45:34|O|CDR|You got something ...?
133:45:38|O|CMP|Yes. Yes, sir. Purring across the deep. Okay. Look at that.
133:49:44|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by.
133:49:54|T|CMP|Roger. Apollo 11.
133:49:56|T|CC|Roger. We'd like you, sometime at your convenience, to stir up the CRYO's on this pass. And we're wondering if you got the fuel cell purge. Over.
133:50:08|T|CMP|Roger. ... fuel cell purge ...
133:50:12|T|CC|Say again. You're breaking up.
133:50:18|T|CMP|Roger. The O2 fuel cell purge is complete.
133:50:22|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
133:52:42|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've got a load for you, if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. The load consists of a CSM pre TEI state vector that's going in the CSM slot, and a post-TEI state vector that'll go into the LM slot, if that's okay; and also a TEI target load. Any comments? Over.
133:53:07|T|CMP|Very good. Thank you very much.
133:53:08|T|CC|Yes, sir.
133:53:09|T|CMP|P00 and ACCEPT. You got it.
133:53:10|T|CC|Thank you.
133:53:31|T|CC|And, 11, Houston. A reminder: you can scratch the VERB 66 at 134 30.
133:53:41|T|CMP|Understand.
133:54:03|T|CC|And, 11, Houston. For your information, Eagle, we had an ISS fail light came on at about 3 19 due to a CDU overheating; and at about this time at AOS it looks like we're about to lose the platform.
133:54:25|T|CMP|...
133:55:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At this time the crew should be involved in their pre-transearth injection status checks. They will also be aligning the platform on their spacecraft guidance system and will be passing up the final information for the transearth injection burn computed on the ground. A few minutes ago you heard Charlie Duke advise the crew that we show the LM platform is about to go. We've mentioned that prior to leaving the Lunar Module the crew had deactivated the primary cooling loop placing the secondary cooling loop in operation aboard the LM. This means that the primary guidance system does not get cooling. This is part of a preplanned test to find out just how long the primary guidance system would continue to function without cooling. We had predicted in advance that it would - may not - possibly not last much longer than a hour or so, but at the time Charlie Duke reported the platform had just gone down on the LM, it had been in operation without cooling a little more than four hours. We had an approximate time from the crew of transferring to the secondary cooling loop of about 129 hours 40 minutes and we got the report from Duke that the LM guidance platform was no longer usable at 133 hours 55 minutes. We'll continue to standby for any further conversation from the crew. We're now one hour twenty minutes ten seconds away from transearth injection which will occur on the backside of the Moon at the beginning of the thirty-first revolution.
134:00:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. You can have the computer - -
134:00:12|T|LMP|11. Are you through with the computer?
134:00:14|T|CC|That's affirmative, Buzz.
134:00:20|T|LMP|All right. That's timing for you.
134:00:41|T|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over.
134:00:56|T|LMP|Stand by.
134:01:14|T|LMP|Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
134:01:16|T|CC|Roger, 11. Got two PADS for you, TEI 30 and then a TEI 31. TEI 30 SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 061, plus 066 135 23 4156. NOUN 81: 32 - correction, plus 32011, plus 06818, minus 02650 181 054 014. Apogee is NA, perigee plus 00230 3286 - correction, 32836; burn time 2 28 32628 24 1511 357. Next three lines are NA. NOUN 61: plus 1103, minus 17237 11806 36275 195 04 52. Set stars are Deneb and Vega, 242 172 012. We'd like ullage from two jets for 16 seconds, and the horizon is on the 10 degree line at TIG minus 2 minutes; and your sextant star is visible after 134 plus 50. Stand by on your readback. I have a TEI 31 if you're ready to copy. Over.
134:04:14|T|LMP|Roger. TEI 30, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 061, plus 066 135 23 4156, plus 32011, plus 06 818, minus 02650, 181 054 014; apogee NA, plus 00230 32836 228 32628 42 1511 357, NA three lines, plus 1103, minus 17237 11806 36275 195 04 52, Deneb and Vega, 242 172 012, two jet ullage, 16 seconds, horizon out of the window, 10 degrees, TIG minus 2 minutes, sextant star at 134 10. Over.
134:05:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours, 10 minutes. We have about 47 minutes, 30 seconds before losing contact with Apollo 11 as it goes behind the Moon in preparation for the transearth injection burn. With the burn we would reacquire the spacecraft at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 11 seconds. Without the transearth injection burn on the upcoming revolution we would reacquire at 135 hours, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. The final figures on that burn as passed up to the crew a few minutes ago are as follows: ignition will occur at 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. The burn duration will be 2 minutes, 28 seconds. That will add 3284 feet per second to the spacecraft velocity starting it on its path back to Earth. And we would consume about 10,000 pounds of propellant with that burn. Splash would occur according to our preliminary figures, just about precisely as predicted in the Flight Plan. We'll continue to monitor now for any further conversation from the spacecraft.
134:05:43|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. Good readback. You're very weak. If you're ready to copy, I got a TEI 31 for you. Over.
134:06:01|T|LMP|All right. Go ahead.
134:06:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You were cut out. Say again.
134:06:17|T|LMP|Roger. Stand by one.
134:06:18|T|CC|Roger.
134:06:24|T|LMP|All right. Go ahead. I'm ready to copy.

134:07:25|T|LMP|Roger. TEI 31, SPS/G&N: 36691 minus 061, plus 066, 137 22 3985, plus 32838, plus 06845, minus 02487, NA, pitch 052. The rest is NA. Over.
134:07:56|T|CC|Roger. Good readback. And, Buzz, did you say sextant star is visible after 134 50?
134:08:11|T|LMP|No. I wrote down 134 10. I wasn't real sure about that.
134:08:18|T|CC|Roger. It went by me there. RETRO caught it. It's 134 50. Over.
134:08:26|T|LMP|Okay. 134 50. Thank you.
134:08:29|T|CC|Yes, sir.
134:16:53|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. After the burn, we'd like you to trim X and Z. Over.
134:17:05|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie.
134:17:07|T|CC|Roger. And that's to 0.2 foot per second, as shown in the Flight Plan.
134:17:23|T|CMP|Sounds like there's a story behind that one, too.
134:17:28|T|CC|We'll tell you when you get back.
134:20:22|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that you've stirred up the CRYO's? Over.
134:20:31|T|CMP|Roger. We've stirred them up.
134:20:33|T|CC|Thank you, sir.
134:25:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control at 134 hours, 32 minutes. Flight director Gene Kranz just requested his Flight Controllers to view all of their data, take a good look at the spacecraft, and be prepared to make go, no go recommendations shortly for the transearth injection burn. That maneuver now 51 minutes, 27 seconds away. All systems on the spacecraft looking good at this point. The cabin temperature has been running about 72 degrees. At this time, the crew is aligning the platform on their guidance system. The stable platform used as a attitude reference for the upcoming burn. We've had very little conversation both here in the Control Center and from the spacecraft on this pass. We'll continue to stand by and monitor.
134:37:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You are GO for TEI. Over.
134:37:59|T|CMP|Apollo 11. Thank you.
134:45:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 48 minutes. It continues very quiet out here in Mission Control. The Flight Controllers have been observing the crew inputs through their computer and monitoring as the crew prepares for the trans Earth injection burn, scheduled to occur in about 35 minutes from now. We have now 9 minutes 20 seconds until loss of signal. The spacecraft currently traveling at a speed of 5,329 feet per second and the altitude is 62.5 nautical miles. At the time of the trans Earth injection burn, the Lunar Module, Eagle, should be about 20 miles behind the Command Module.
134:45:00|P|PAO|The crew has a go for the trans Earth injection at the beginning of the 31 revolution. All systems on the spacecraft are looking very good at this point. You heard Capcom Charlie Duke advise Mike Collins that we will reacquire the spacecraft on the other side of the Moon. Now with the burn the Ground Elapsed Time of 135 hours 34 minutes and 5 seconds. Without the burn we reacquire at 135 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds. We now have 6 minutes 50 seconds until loss of signal. We will continue to monitor.
134:45:00|P|PAO|Thirty seconds now until loss of signal. We've had a last status check from the Flight Director and all around the room the word is go. We're now 26 minutes 23 seconds from the trans Earth injection maneuver - 20 seconds until loss of signal.
134:45:00|P|PAO|And we have loss of signal now. We should next reacquire Apollo 11 at 135 hours 34 minutes 5 seconds. We are now 25 minutes 38 seconds from trans Earth injection.
134:49:25|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You've got about 8 minutes till LOS. Your AOS with the burn, 135 34 05, no burn 135 44. Over.
134:49:43|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
134:49:46|T|CC|Yes, sir.
134:56:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS. Go sic 'em.
134:56:41|T|CMP|Thank you, sir. We'll do it.
134:57:22|O|CDR|Yes. We can get VERB 64 before we come over the hill and see what looks good.
134:57:28|O|LMP|Okay. LOS.
134:57:30|O|CDR|Okay. I'm ready to proceed now.
134:57:34|O|LMP|Do it.
134:57:37|O|CDR|Here we go.
134:57:42|O|CMP|Say, you guys, ... anything you want to do?
134:57:56|O|CDR|I got to make a star check, yet.
134:58:07|O|LMP|You're not going to fool around with that camera anymore, are you?
134:58:09|O|CDR|No.
134:58:11|O|CMP|I'll take care of it for you.
134:58:13|O|CDR|Post - we might - after post - after PDI if you can put it somewhere where you can get at it. Going away from the moon. I just didn't want it in my way - -
134:58:25|O|CMP|Get all - -
134:58:26|O|CDR|Well, yes, pull it - pull it out of the way.
134:58:27|O|LMP|Neil, the handle -
134:58:29|O|CDR|I have it right here. That durn near has a roll in it - it -
134:58:38|O|CMP|I'll bet you ... likes this.
134:58:42|O|CDR|No. I don't care about any - Well, if it's annoying - let me - I can get it if it is. ... star check ... I don't care about ...
135:00:00|O|LMP|What's that pad say about horizon on the 100-degree - -
135:00:05|O|CMP|2 minutes prior, 100-degree line,
135:00:18|O|CDR|You got double lines?
135:00:19|O|CMP|Yes, I got double line on the 30, so I can use that as a head position ... look down between them.
135:00:25|O|CDR|They're not - they're not parallel? Can you see in the one-eye position?
135:00:30|O|CMP|What I'm saying is, on the 30 degree, I have both panes of glass - -
135:00:34|O|LMP|Yes.
135:00:36|O|CMP|- - and if you line those up then, then is your eye in the right position for all the others?
135:00:39|O|LMP|Yes.
135:00:40|O|CMP|Okay.
135:00:41|O|CDR|What's the shaft and trunnion number?
135:00:45|O|CMP|1511.
135:00:47|O|CDR|What? 1511?
135:00:52|O|CMP|151 - -
135:00:54|O|CDR|1511.
135:00:55|O|CMP|We're a long way from being there, Neil; we're rolling over at a very slow rate.
135:00:58|O|CDR|Okay.
135:01:00|O|CMP|You want an extra ... - we got a lot of gas - -
135:01:01|O|CDR|No, no, no.
135:01:02|O|CMP|Be happy to zip on around.
135:02:16|O|CMP|This thing is taking forever to get around here; we've got 20 minutes to TIG. I think I'll speed it up a bit, if you don't mind.
135:02:24|O|CDR|Hey, you got - 1, 0.1, point 1 you mean?
135:02:29|O|CMP|Yes.
135:02:44|O|CMP|You know, if you hit this hand controller like you do in the simulator, MINIMUM IMPULSE, just bang it, it'll bang over and bang back, and it'll fire two opposing pulses, and you get nothing. You know that?
135:02:53|O|CDR|(Laughter) Yes.
135:05:18|O|CMP|Oh, shit. ... yaw out 14 degrees. Why in the hell didn't I do that? Read that number wrong.
135:05:29|O|CDR|Yes, it should have been 1.4 degrees yaw.
135:05:37|O|LMP|That "1" gets moved over so far.
135:05:40|O|CMP|Yes, the goddam "1" in this computer, you know - trunnion angle, it's there; DELTA-V, it's there; angles, it's there. It's probably over here for something although I can't think for what, but there, there, there, and there, of course – there is four places.
135:05:55|O|LMP|Okay, we're there, Neil; by the time you can get down there and get your eyeball out the window - -
135:05:59|O|CDR|Hey, what did you do with those numbers again?
135:06:01|O|CMP|Oh, we'll crank them in the computer.
135:06:03|O|CDR|Oh, I got them.
135:06:08|O|CMP|Questioning the accuracy of the computer?
135:06:14|O|CDR|...
135:06:23|O|CMP|Okay, you satisfied with that?

135:06:37|O|CMP|You mean after I went to all this work of cranking those numbers in you're going to drive back to zero?
135:06:43|O|LMP|We got PROGRAM ALARM and an OPERATOR ERROR.
135:06:46|O|MS|(Laughter)
135:06:47|O|CMP|Christ. Give me the numbers, 1519 and what?
135:06:54|O|LMP|It won't pass with that number.
135:06:58|O|CDR|1511 - 357.
135:07:01|O|CMP|357, okay.
135:07:15|O|CMP|357 and 1511. There's supposed to be a star there.
135:07:26|O|CDR|That's right, if you put them in - in the right order. That 151.1 is shaft.
135:07:36|O|CMP|Yes. I got a star in the - in the sextant.
135:07:38|O|CDR|Good, it passes. Let's press on.
135:07:41|O|CMP|I'm not sure it's Gienah.

135:11:58|O|LMP|I'll get those.
135:12:00|O|CMP|Okay. I was just wondering if they were on – not questioning your checklist, just out of curiosity.
135:12:29|O|LMP|You going to pitch up after the burn?
135:12:33|O|CMP|Sounds like a good idea; let's look at the moon after the burn. That'll give us high-gain, right?
135:12:41|O|LMP|Check.
135:12:52|O|CDR|Okay, 10 minutes until TIG.
135:12:55|O|CMP|Alright.
135:13:10|O|CDR|It's hot in here, isn't it?
135:13:17|O|LMP|... boiling any water.
135:13:21|O|CDR|You do it all?
135:13:22|O|LMP|No. It's not too hot, it's 65.
135:13:31|O|CMP|Those temperatures are deceptive. I don't know where they measure it, but the cold point is -
135:13:36|O|CDR|Okay. Sunrise, now 10 minutes prior to TIG; I should have the horizon on the 10-degree line, huh?
135:13:43|O|CMP|No, 10 degrees - 2 minutes.
135:13:45|O|CDR|2 minutes; that's more like it, there.
135:14:00|O|CMP|... this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless.
135:14:09|O|CDR|...
135:14:12|O|CMP|I'm graphically reminded of it at this moment. Yes. I see a horizon. It looks like we are going forward (laughter).
135:14:26|O|CDR|Shades of Gemini.
135:14:29|O|CMP|It is most important that we be going forward (laughter).
135:14:40|O|CMP|There's only one really bad mistake you can make there.
135:14:50|O|LMP|Shades of Gemini retrofire, are you sure we're - (laughter) - No, let 's see - the motors point this way and the gases escape that way, therefore imparting a thrust that-a-way.
135:15:03|O|CDR|Yes, horizon looks good.
135:15:06|O|LMP|Okay, we got 8-1/2 to TIG.
135:15:28|O|CMP|Somewhere along the line, I think I'll trim this maneuver just for the hell of it. Would this be a good time to do it, Buzz, at 8 minutes prior? You don't care when I do it, do you?
135:15:35|O|LMP|No, it probably would be after we - when the gimbals are out.
135:15:38|O|CMP|Oh, yes, alright. Okay.
135:15:47|O|CDR|Beautiful looking horizon, it's hard to describe.
135:15:50|O|LMP|We can see it if we look through that thing you have.
135:15:53|O|CMP|Where's ...?
135:15:55|O|LMP|Here or here? God, it has an eerie look to it. It's not a horizon, it's just a band.
135:16:03|O|CMP|You won't be able to see it, Neil, ...
135:16:07|O|CDR|Which way?
135:16:09|O|CMP|This way. Plus X ...
135:16:14|O|CDR|It was really eerie when it first came - -
135:16:17|O|LMP|You got to look through the part of the window that isn't -
135:16:20|O|CDR|Yes. And the way the terminator is, you don't see the whole moon at all, you just see a - -
135:16:24|O|CMP|I know, I was looking at it upside down for a while.
135:16:27|O|CDR|Yes, and then that scares you, because that says you're going retrograde, right? Well, let's see, if it's upside down, you're going backwards.
135:16:33|O|LMP|Yes.
135:16:40|O|CDR|Okay, it looks good, I'll tell you.
135:16:44|O|CMP|Alright, we'recoming up on bus tie time; we've got a little over 6:50 until TIG.
135:17:05|O|CDR|Ready for the bus ties.

135:19:00|O|LMP|CDR
135:19:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now less than 30 seconds from the time in which trans-Earth injection is scheduled, the burn to start Apollo 11 on its trajectory back to Earth. We're now 15 seconds from the scheduled ignition time. That burn will last about 2 minutes 28 seconds and consume 10,000 pounds of propellant. The crew should be burning at this time. Of course, that maneuver is performed on the back side of the Moon. We have no data from the spacecraft here in Mission Control at this time. We won't know how the burn went for about another ten minutes, which is the time of which we're scheduled to reacquire Apollo 11. During the course of this burn the spacecraft will increase its speed by about 3280 feet per second, or about 2240 miles per hour.
135:19:00|P|PAO|Trans-Earth injection should be completed in about 10 seconds from now. And we should have shut-down at this time. At this point Apollo 11 should be traveling at a speed of about 8660 feet per second, or about 5900 miles per hour. It should be on its way back to Earth, headed for Splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 195 hours 18 minutes. With a successful burn we should reacquire Apollo 11 in 7 minutes 20 seconds from now.
135:19:02|O|CDR|Okay. GPI set. Verify MTVC.

135:20:46|O|CDR|2 minutes to get our horizon check at 10 degrees.
135:20:48|O|LMP|Yes, and - sneaking up on there, looks pretty darn good. Looks like we're darn near right.
135:21:10|O|CDR|Just about midnight in Houston town.
135:21:15|O|CMP|Yes.
135:21:16|O|LMP|Okay, coming up on 2 minutes, and this damn horizon check is going to be, would you believe, perfect?
135:21:23|O|CDR|I hope so.
135:21:24|O|LMP|Fantastic. First time we ever got a perfect horizon check. Spent too many hours in the simulator looking for an unreal horizon. Alright, horizon check passes.
135:21:37|O|CMP|Beautiful.
135:21:38|O|LMP|2 minutes - -

135:21:43|O|CDR|- - okay, DELTA-V THRUST A, NORMAL; stand by for a malfunction - it's not there. Very good.
135:21:49|O|CMP|Probably get the sun in your window on that burn.
135:21:51|O|CDR|Yes, I believe it.
135:21:52|O|CMP|The sun - -
135:21:53|O|LMP|ROTATIONAL HAND CONTROLLER, number 2, ARMED.

135:22:04|O|CMP|Ullage is going to be 16 seconds at 2 JETS.
135:22:07|O|LMP|TAPE RECORDER is going to COMMAND RESET on the HIGH BIT RATE.
135:22:25|O|CMP|Got to go from STANDBY to NORMAL.
135:22:28|O|LMP|I'll do that in 35 seconds.
135:22:29|O|CDR|Ullage is 16 seconds, 2 JETS.

135:23:44|O|CMP|Burn! A good one. Nice - -
135:23:45|O|LMP|I got two balls - -
135:23:46|O|CMP|- - okay, here comes the other two - -
135:23:47|O|LMP|- - barber pole, gray, the other two are on good.
135:23:51|O|CMP|Man, that feels like g, doesn't it?
135:23:56|O|LMP|I caught up - I caught up for a short while, but ...
135:24:03|O|CMP|... pressures are good. Busy in steering, but it's holding right in there.
135:24:13|O|LMP|How is it, Mike?
135:24:19|O|CMP|It's really busy in roll, but it's holding in its deadband. Looks like it's holding instead of plus or minus 5, more like plus or minus 8 - It's possible that we have a roll-thruster problem, but if we have, it's taking it out. No point in worrying about it. Okay, coming up on 1 minute -
135:24:44|O|CMP|MARK it -
135:24:45|O|CMP|1 minute. Chamber pressure's holding right on 100.
135:24:46|O|LMP|... time looks good.
135:24:48|O|CMP|Gimbals look good; total attitude looks good. Rates are damped out - a little bit. Still a little busy, light ...
135:25:01|O|CDR|... still ahead.
135:25:08|O|CDR|Should I be going ...?
135:25:11|O|CMP|Follow the needle; follow the needle ... Take it off. Okay. Looking good.

135:25:22|O|MS|...
135:25:24|O|CMP|How's that nitrogen pressure? Okay?
135:25:25|O|CDR|Yes.
135:25:26|O|CMP|Good.
135:25:36|O|CDR|... pressures are GO.

135:25:45|O|CMP|Hits the end of that roll deadband, it really comes crisply back.
135:25:55|O|CMP|Okay, chamber pressure's falling off a little bit; now it's going back up; chamber pressure's oscillating just a tad.
135:26:04|O|CDR|10 seconds left, ... - -
135:26:05|O|CMP|We don't care about the chamber pressure, ... watch yourself for - brace yourself - Standing by for ENGINE, OFF.
135:26:11|O|CDR|It should be shutdown now.
135:26:15|O|CMP|Okay?

135:27:23|O|LMP|Let me record them - -
135:27:24|O|CMP|- - five balls, plus 0.0, and I call it 0.8, it was hanging on 0.7 for a while, and it was zeroed and down. I'd give them - it was 0.1 down – plus 0.1. Now it's on zero, shit. Can't read those residuals; they dance all over the place.
135:27:40|O|CDR|Okay, the residuals were 0.1, 3.9, and point - -
135:27:46|O|LMP|Beautiful burn; SPS, I love you; you are a Jewel! Whoosh!
135:27:53|O|CDR|Alright – EMS FUNCTION, OFF.

135:28:08|O|LMP|02:30 or 02:31 - -
135:28:15|O|CMP|Okay. Let's go. ROTATIONAL CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, two of them, OFF?
135:28:23|O|LMP|OFF, OFF. Good show.
135:28:31|O|CMP|We want to pitch over, I guess. Don't know if it matters much which way.
135:28:40|O|CDR|Oh, probably -up will be the best - -
135:28:44|O|LMP|Pitch up.
135:28:46|O|CDR|- - to keep the moon in sight.
135:28:49|O|CMP|Alright, is that ROTATIONAL CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, two of them, OFF?
135:28:52|O|CDR|Yes, I do.
135:28:53|O|CMP|Circuit breakers - SPS PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN?
135:28:56|O|CDR|They're open.
135:28:58|O|CMP|Proceed.
135:29:00|O|CDR|I think you did that already.
135:29:04|O|CMP|Hey, Neil, you want to proceed on these?
135:29:05|O|CDR|Yes.
135:29:06|O|CMP|Okay, where do we go, P00? To get the high-gain?
135:29:11|O|CDR|We want - Yes, P00's good - and we want a VERB 48.
135:29:16|O|LMP|Yes. Get in P00 and do a VERB 83.
135:29:18|O|CMP|I'm going to go to SCS and pitch up in the meantime.
135:29:25|O|LMP|Find out where that - other state vector is.
135:29:33|O|CDR|Okay, we're in P00, now who wants what, VERB 48?
135:29:35|O|LMP|No - yes. VERB - oh, okay.
135:29:38|O|CDR|Ah - -
135:29:40|O|LMP|I don't know ... -
135:29:41|O|CDR|Well, it says change spacecraft weight.
135:29:44|O|CMP|DAP update. Yes - -
135:29:45|O|CDR|You've got your - -
135:29:46|O|CMP|- - 10101 does change - it has been changed. Okay, we've done that.
135:29:52|O|CDR|...
135:29:53|O|CMP|... Service Module RCS - -
135:29:55|O|LMP|I've done that. Done that.
135:29:56|O|CMP|Oh. Okay - -
135:29:57|O|CDR|VERB 83.
135:29:58|O|CMP|- - RCS monitors checked - (Laughter) Okay, here comes Buzz's baby - VERB 83 - de-dum-de-dum-de-dum. Operator error (laughter).
135:30:08|O|LMP|... you don't know how to do it.
135:30:09|O|CMP|(Laughter)
135:30:13|O|LMP|Look at that, would you? Look at that.
135:30:14|O|CMP|Isn't that beautiful?
135:30:15|O|CDR|Pretty good.
135:30:16|O|CMP|A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
135:30:22|O|LMP|Alright, now call the VERB 89 in and see which way that - -
135:30:25|O|CMP|Oh, come on, you're not serious.
135:30:45|O|LMP|... know to find out which way the ... is -
135:30:49|O|CMP|Okay.
135:30:50|O|LMP|- - you were wrong. ...
135:31:07|O|CMP|Okay, we got to visually acquire moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.
135:31:15|O|CDR|... some unknown reason - -
135:31:17|O|LMP|We haven't got any damned program ready to call up. ... It's the only way you can do it. Supposed to do a VERB 66 and then put numbers ... apogee ... and then look at altitude and altitude rate - -
135:31:34|O|CDR|What are you doing, Mike? What you taking pictures of -
135:31:40|O|CMP|Oh, I don't know. Wasting film, I guess.
135:31:43|O|CDR|You can take some pretty good pictures out of the hatch, here.
135:31:46|O|CMP|You're right. This crapping thing - ... set on f:4 or 5.6; that's probably about right.
135:31:57|O|LMP|Here's a ring that came from somewhere; I wonder where (singing).
135:32:04|O|CDR|You want to take pictures over here? Go ahead, why don't you just set up that - -
135:32:07|O|CMP|I'll check window 3.
135:32:10|O|CDR|- - set up that tape and let it do its thing; it's still got a long way to go for ...
135:32:15|O|LMP|Alright, now, do we want black and white, color, 250, or 80? I've got all options over here.
135:32:19|O|CDR|Oh, we'll probably want - How many cameras you got?
135:32:21|O|LMP|Let me have a camera. How many cameras?
135:32:23|O|CMP|Well, only one camera, but I've got ... lenses.
135:32:28|O|LMP|You're a poor ...
135:32:29|O|CDR|Well, let's take some color, and -
135:32:38|O|CMP|Want the 80, right? On this one?
135:32:46|O|LMP|Yes, I think you want to get - -
135:32:49|O|CMP|Let me know when I'm in a - in a good attitude to stop this pitch. How about right now?
135:32:54|O|CDR|Stop. What are you doing?
135:32:56|O|CMP|I'm rolling.
135:32:58|O|LMP|What for? What do you want to roll for?
135:33:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now less than 1 minute from reacquiring Apollo 11. When last we heard from the spacecraft all systems were looking very good and we were in very good shape for the transearth injection maneuver. At this point Apollo 11 should be about 10,000 pounds lighter and on its way back to Earth. We're now 32 seconds from reacquiring. We'll stand by for communications with the spacecraft.
135:33:00|P|PAO|And there's the cue, we have acquisition of signal. And we have data right on schedule. Rog. Zero minus 0.7 minus 0.2.
135:33:00|P|PAO|Most of the conversations so far has been from Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins. That last comment came from Collins. Our first report after acquisition was from Neil Armstrong. That transearth injection burn was very close to nominal. At this time we show the spacecraft traveling at a speed of 7,603 feet per second. The velocity already beginning to drop off and we're at an altitude of 445 nautical miles now from the Moon. This is Apollo Control. We now show the spacecraft traveling at 7,378 feet per second. Altitude 568 nautical miles. The next order of business will
135:33:00|P|PAO|be to get the crew to sleep. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, requested his Flight Controllers, prior to acquisition of signal to review their procedures and to take as many steps as possible to get the crew to sleep as soon as possible. There will be a press conference in the building 1 auditorium. We estimate the time on that at about 12:300 Central Daylight Time. And our LM telecommunications engineer reports that we've just had acquisition of signal from Eagle which is still in lunar orbit. The last fix that we had on Eagle's orbit showed an apogee of 64. 1 and a para - apocynthion rather of 64. 1 and a pericynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. The spacecraft altitude is now climbed to almost 700 nautical miles from the Moon. We show a weight of 26,510 pounds. About 10,000 pounds less than what we had actually about 1100 or 11,000 pounds - lets correct that - about 10,100 pounds less than what we had prior to the transearth injection burn.
135:33:02|O|CMP|I was off in roll; I'm taking it back to where I should have been. This is a pretty good attitude right here, looks to me -
135:33:14|O|LMP|Alright, I've seen enough of VERB 83, Mike - -
135:33:16|O|CMP|Here you go.
135:33:20|O|LMP|- - unless you want to call a VERB 89.
135:33:24|O|CMP|Not me; I'd rather take pictures.
135:33:32|O|CDR|What time is AOS?
135:33:35|O|LMP|Haven't the foggiest.
135:33:36|O|CMP|It's 135:34.
135:33:40|O|CDR|That's right now.
135:33:42|O|LMP|Give me a VERB 51.
135:33:55|O|CDR|Anybody got any choice greetings they want to make to Houston?
135:33:58|O|CMP|No, I - the best burn I've ever seen in my life, I'll tell you. I guess you guys have seen two good ones today.
135:34:09|O|LMP|Oh, a couple.
135:34:11|O|CMP|Yes, more than two. AOS.
135:34:34|O|LMP|Yes, we sure as hell have.
135:34:38|O|CDR|Get the burn status.
135:34:41|O|LMP|Hey, I hope somebody's getting the picture of the Earth coming up.
135:34:44|O|CMP|... Not quite pitched far enough. Well, maybe I can get it out - -
135:34:53|O|CDR|I can get around to here.
135:34:54|O|CMP|- - your window.
135:34:57|O|CDR|Upside down; turn the camera upside down; then it'll look right.
135:35:14|T|CC|Hello Apollo 11. Houston. How did it go? Over.
135:35:22|T|CMP|Time to open up the LRL doors, Charlie.
135:35:25|T|CC|Roger. We got you coming home. It's well stocked.
135:35:33|T|CDR|Okay, Burn status: DELTA-TIG was zero, burn time was 2 plus 30. PAD angles: DELTA VGX after trim was 0.1, VGY 0.9, VGZ 0.1. DELTA-VC minus 17.9, fuel 10.6, OX 10.4, unbalance minus 50.
135:36:01|T|CC|Roger. Copy, Neil. Sounds good to us.
135:36:16|T|CC|And Apollo 11, Houston. All your systems look real good to us. We'll keep you posted.
135:36:27|T|CDR|Roger.
135:36:28|T|CDR|Hey, Charlie boy, looking good here. That was a beautiful burn. They don't come any finer.
135:36:31|T|CC|Roger.
135:36:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I wondered if you've compared your state vector accuracy with the one in the LM flights? Over.
135:36:59|T|CDR|Yes, sir, and it looked very nice. VERB 83 was plus 00070 and minus 00008.
135:37:10|T|CC|Roger.
135:37:38|T|CC|11, Houston. I was looking at your bank Bravo nitrogen tank. It didn't leak a bit - correction - didn't leak a bit this time. Over.
135:37:51|T|CDR|Roger. Looked good here.
135:37:53|T|CMP|Chamber pressure was hanging in there around 100. The latter part, of the burn it started oscillating a little bit and got down a little bit below 100.
135:37:59|T|CC|Roger.
135:38:00|T|CMP|96 or so.
135:38:01|T|CC|Roger.
135:46:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control. The flight dynamics officer reports that the burn very nominal. Almost precisely as planned, the burn duration was about 3 seconds long, but the velocity change was almost precisely what we had been expecting. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 1076 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity continuing to drop off, down now to 6698 feet per second.
135:47:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 in ACCEPT? We've got a REFSMMAT for you. Over.
135:47:36|T|CMP|Okay.
135:47:37|T|CC|Thank you.
135:50:07|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
135:50:16|T|CMP|We're there.
135:50:18|T|CC|Roger.
135:50:38|T|CMP|Your Command Module film seems to be working out pretty well, Charlie, the amount we carried. Looks like we carried just about what we needed.
135:50:45|T|CC|Wonderful.
135:50:51|T|CMP|We have one 16 millimeter roll on the ASA 1000 color interior film. We were thinking of shooting that during the entry, out window number 4 on a bracket, and you might get the camera guide sometime in the next couple of days and give us all the good settings for that.
135:51:09|T|CC|Roger.
135:54:46|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if during the TEI burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS. Over.
135:55:06|T|LMP|Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. Over.
135:55:40|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much, Buzz.
135:55:41|T|LMP|Two tenths of a percent, I'm sorry.
135:55:43|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
135:59:37|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You can go to PTC attitude and torque at your - and do the P52 and torque at your convenience. Over.
135:59:50|T|CMP|Hey, we got to take some more pictures, Charlie. Is there any constraint, normally, in staying here for awhile?
135:59:55|T|CC|No, sir.
136:00:00|T|CMP|Thank you.
136:20:37|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
136:20:42|T|CMP|How does that tracking look, or is it too early to tell?
136:20:45|T|CC|Stand by, Mike.
136:21:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. FIDO's are looking at the data. It's too early to tell yet exactly. It's looking real good so far. We'll have you some answers shortly on trajectory. Over.
136:21:27|T|CMP|Okay. What FIDO is that?
136:21:33|T|CC|That's Jay Green.
136:21:40|T|CMP|Howdy, Jay.
136:21:54|T|CC|11, Houston. We have a DAP CSM update for you.
136:22:03|T|CMP|Go ahead.
136:22:04|T|CC|Roger. CSM weight, Mike: 26370. Over.
136:22:12|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
136:22:14|T|CC|Welcome.
136:24:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We've taken your onboard vector and propagated it forward, and it's looking real good. We only got about 24 minutes of tracking now. Really too early to tell on the radar. Over.
136:24:26|T|CMP|Roger. Understand.
136:28:08|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.
136:28:21|T|CMP|Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light Command Module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.
136:29:12|T|CC|Roger. Thank you much. We were looking at the playback, and we saw some things that - right at start up. We'll be back with you later on that.
136:29:22|T|CMP|Okay.
136:42:26|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Have you finished taking pictures? Over.
136:42:36|T|CMP|We're just finishing up, Charlie.
136:42:38|T|CC|Roger.
136:42:45|T|CMP|About to get started on the P52 here pretty soon.
136:42:48|T|CC|Copy.
136:42:50|T|CMP|Another eight or nine of them.
136:44:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 136 hours, 44 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 3,720 nautical miles from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 5,367 feet per second. During the press conference we accumulated about 4 minutes of taped conversation with the crew. The crew reports at this time that they are completing taking pictures and they are getting ready to realign their guidance system platform. We'll pick up the tape conversation and then stand by for any following live communications with the crew. We anticipate that they will be shortly beginning their pre-sleep checklist in preparation for a well deserved rest period.
136:44:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the taped conversation. We'll stand by for any further live communication from the crew before they begin their sleep period. We've gotten some preliminary figures from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transearth injection burn after a review of the telemetry data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal. Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost precisely as predicted or planned in the Flight Plan. That would be at 195 hours and 18 minutes, 40 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. And we would expect that splash down time to change some what during the transearth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for mid-course correction becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles from the Moon
136:44:00|P|PAO|traveling at almost precisely 1 mile per second, 5,283 feet per second and that's just updated 5,280 feet per second.
136:44:00|P|PAO|That exchange was between Donald K, Deke, Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center and astronaut Neil Armstrong.
136:52:26|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can crank up on the PTC at any time. Over.
136:52:33|T|CMP|All right-o.
136:52:45|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
136:52:50|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
136:52:52|T|CC|Roger, 11. This is the regional Capcom. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.
136:53:21|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you, boss. We'll - We're looking forward to a little rest and a restful trip back. And see you when we get there.
136:53:30|T|CC|Roger. You've earned it.
136:54:13|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to turn off O2 tank number 1 heaters. Over.
136:54:27|T|CMP|It's off. Thank you.
136:54:29|T|CC|Roger.
136:54:57|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. For your information, the LGC in Eagle just went belly up at 7 hours. Over.
136:55:10|T|CDR|Okay. Very good, ... death of a real winner, there.
136:55:26|T|CMP|Charlie, we're going to rotate about pitch 270 degrees on the way home vice 1 - or 090 on the way out. Right?
136:55:34|T|CC|Right, sir.
136:55:39|T|CMP|Okay. VERB 49 maneuver to that attitude is in progress.
136:55:43|T|CC|Roger.
136:56:14|T|CDR|Houston, crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019,LMP 09020. No medication.
136:56:29|T|CC|Say again, please, Neil. We - you were breaking up. We missed that. Over.
136:56:37|T|CDR|Okay. This is crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.
136:56:56|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
136:57:00|T|CC|And we didn't get any crew status report from you this morning. Wondered if you could give us an estimate of sleep last night. Over.
136:57:12|T|CDR|Okay ...
136:57:48|T|CDR|Okay. We'll take a guess, Charlie, and try to give an equivalent amount. Oh, it's CDR 3, and LMP 4.
136:58:00|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much.
136:58:25|T|CDR|And, Charlie, you want the fans cycled ... Right?
136:58:30|T|CC|That's affirmative, and we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta. Over.
136:58:38|T|CMP|Okay. Charlie and Delta.
136:59:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient, we'd like to go through your onboard readout. Over.
136:59:21|T|CMP|Of what?
136:59:22|T|CC|Oh, excuse me. It's on the Flight Plan, 3102. We'd like BATTS and RCS. Over.
136:59:33|T|CMP|Stand by.
137:00:38|T|CMP|Ready to copy, Houston?
137:00:40|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
137:00:44|T|CMP|BATT Charlie 370, PYRO BATT A 370, BATT B 370; RCS, 55, 65, 64, and 62. Over.
137:00:59|T|CC|Roger. We copy all that. Thank you much.
137:01:05|T|CMP|Roger.
137:17:01|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of questions for the Moon walkers, if you got a second. Over.
137:17:09|T|CDR|Go ahead.
137:17:11|T|CC|Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over.
137:17:37|T|CDR|No. It's about in the nine or nine thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.
137:17:50|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.
137:18:02|T|CDR|Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.
137:18:21|T|CC|Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.
137:18:35|T|CDR|I don't remember. Just that the Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.
137:18:50|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much.
137:21:09|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you keep me honest on the lithium hydroxide changes? When do you have the next one scheduled for?
137:21:16|T|CC|Stand by.
137:22:09|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, on that canister, we had you due to change one at 133 before TEI, and it's on page 399. The next one we got is at 147. Over.
137:22:30|T|CMP|Okay.
137:24:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control at 137 hours, 27 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of about 4982 feet per second. At about 5900 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 198,900 nautical miles from Earth. A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene on the lunar surface at the time the planned Ascent Stage lifted off. Armstrong reported seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton, which is a plastic-like insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is found on the outside surface of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes, about 40 minutes or so ago that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived of the coolant, a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant. The platform apparently begin to become unuseable after about 4 hours, and the computer itself finally gave up after about 7 hours, 13 minutes. Both items going considerably longer than had previously been predicted. The Lunar Module Ascent Stage still in lunar orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. All other systems appear to be functioning well at this time. The LM orbit we show as currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And, the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and here's a call to the crew.
137:25:31|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to extend our damping period for another 5 minutes; let the rates get way down. Over.
137:25:42|T|CMP|11. Roger.
137:30:12|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
137:30:14|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
137:30:19|T|CMP|Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.
137:31:41|T|CC|Roger. We copy, Mike. Stand by.
137:31:46|T|CMP|Okay.
137:37:21|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Check in A1, Mike, and see what you can find in there. Over.
137:37:34|T|CC|We think you might have some more chlorine up in A1. Over.
137:38:25|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston.
137:38:42|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
137:38:50|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? You're breaking up. Over.
137:38:57|T|CMP|Roger. Read.
137:39:02|T|CC|Roger, 11. You're breaking up. Mike, please look in compartment A1. We think there might be some more chlorine up there. Over.
137:39:21|T|CMP|Eureka!
137:39:26|T|CC|11, Houston. Reading you about one by. Over.
137:41:43|T|CC|11, Houston. We're having a downlink problem. That's the reason we can't read you. We're switching sites. Stand by.
137:42:02|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.
137:42:09|T|CMP|Fine.
137:42:10|T|CC|Roger. You're five by now, too, Mike. Thank you much. Did you copy that about A1 on that chlorine?
137:42:20|T|CMP|Eureka!
137:42:21|T|CC|How about that, sports fans!
137:44:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 137 hours, 52 minutes. Apollo 11 crew has signed off for the night, starting a well deserved rest period. Duration of the rest period is programmed for 10 hours, however, the wake up time is not critical. It's very likely that we'll let them sleep until they wake up of their own accord. At this time Columbia is 7,045 nautical miles away from the Moon, headed toward home at a velocity of 4,868 feet per second.
137:45:26|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're having a little trouble getting the yaw rate damped out to the appropriate value. We'd like you all to be quite like mice for a couple of minutes and let's see if that will help it out. Over.
137:45:45|T|CC|11, Houston. You did great work there. We're ready to spin it up. Over.
137:46:30|T|CC|11, Houston. Did you copy? Over.
137:46:43|T|LMP|Yes. We read you, Charlie. Would you stand by a minute?
137:46:46|T|CC|Roger. No hurry.
137:47:18|T|CC|11, Houston. Shift change time, here. White Team bids you good night; we'll see you tomorrow. Over.
137:47:27|T|CDR|Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
137:47:30|T|LMP|Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
137:47:33|T|CMP|Adios.
137:47:35|T|CC|Adios. Thanks again for a great show, you guys.
137:47:41|T|CMP|Thanks for a great job down there.
138:01:52|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
138:01:59|T|CMP|Good morning, Ron.
138:02:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 02 minutes. Capcom Owen Garriott has just put in a call to the crew and is passing up some antenna information to them. Here's that conversation.
138:02:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Ten minutes ago we logged what we expect to be our last contact with Eagle in lunar orbit. That coming at 137 hours 55 minutes Elapsed Time. At that time the battery power fell below the level where the secondary guidance system could hold the attitude of the vehicle within the sphere of antenna limits. We do not expect to establish contact with Eagle again. We'll continue to stand by here live. There may be a little more conversation before the crew turns in for the night.
138:02:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 11 minutes. We do not intend to contact the crew during this rest period again. We will take this lying down now and come back up if there is further conversation. This is Mission Control, Houston.
138:02:01|T|CC|Howdy there, Mike. We're ready to go ahead and have you switch to your OMNI positions for your sleep period, and we would like the following high-gain switch positions: your high-gain antenna in MANUAL, beam width WIDE, pitch is minus 50, and yaw is a plus 270. And just follow the Flight Plan for remaining COMM configuration. Over.
138:02:37|T|CDR|Roger. Out.
138:02:48|T|CMP|You "Purple" people keep funny hours.
138:02:52|T|CC|Your COMM is pretty weak at this point, Mike. Please say again.
138:02:59|T|CMP|Roger. Disregard.
138:03:39|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
138:03:41|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
138:03:56|T|CMP|It's on the way now.
138:06:20|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like for you to go ahead and put your S band antenna OMNI to OMNI and OMNI B. Over.
138:07:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. How do you read me through Honeysuckle now? Over.
138:08:02|T|CMP|You're loud and clear. Over.
138:08:03|T|CC|Very good. Reading you better now. And did you copy we'd appreciate going S band OMNI and OMNI B at this time? Over.
138:08:14|T|CMP|That's the configuration we're in.
138:08:17|T|CC|Okay. Thank you.
138:08:24|T|CMP|I'll say you "Purple" people keep funny hours.
139:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control at 139 hours. The crew of Apollo 11 is in the rest period. We have not contacted them within the last hour, and have not heard from them. All systems aboard the spacecraft performing well. Apollo 11 is now 10,149 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4659 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 26,510 pounds. This is Mission Control, Houston.
140:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 140 hours. Apollo 11 is now 12,835 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4552 feet per second. All systems still performing well. Dr. Kenneth Biers, the Flight Surgeon, reports his data indicates all three of the crewmen are asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.
141:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 141 hours. Apollo 11 is 15,488 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,480 feet per second. The crew is still asleep. All systems continuing to perform very well. This is Mission Control, Houston.
142:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 03 minutes. Apollo 11 is 18,243 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4426 feet per second. Apollo 11 is in the Passive Thermal Control mode, the performance of all systems nominal, and the crew is asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.
143:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 143 hours. Apollo 11 is 20,704 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 4390 feet per second. The crew is still is the rest period. The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported this morning that weather conditions in the primary landing area are expected to the acceptable, the sky partly cloudy, the winds easterly at 10 knots, and seas of 3 feet are predicted. Tropical storm Claudia is now located 2300 miles east of the landing area and will not affect the weather in the landing area Thursday. This is Mission Control Houston.
144:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 144 hours. Apollo 11 is 23,289 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4,361 feet per second. All systems performing well, and the crew still in their rest period. It does not appear likely that we will perform mid-course correction number 5 scheduled for approximately 150 1/2 hours elapsed time. However, a firm decision on this mid-course will not be made for approximately 3 1/2 hours. This is Mission Control, Houston.
145:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 145 hours. Apollo 11 is 25,857 nautical miles from the Moon. Heading toward home at 4338 feet per second. Apollo 11 will leave the Moon's sphere of influence at an elapse time of 148 hours 7 minutes 23 seconds. This is Mission Control, Houston.
146:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 146 hours. We have heard nothing from the crew. We assume they are still asleep, and that sleep period began at about 137 hours, 47 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is 28,421 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at a speed of 4322 feet per second. The decision on mid-course correction number 5 is still tending toward not doing that mid-course, however the decision hasn't been made final, and there will be some additional tracking prior to firming up that decision. At this point it appears that the mid-course path number 5 opportunity would require about 4 to 5 feet per second. By waiting until the opportunity of mid-course correction 6, about 7 feet per second would be required. We do not plan to awaken the crew, at least immediately. Let them continue sleeping. All spacecraft systems continue to look very good to us from the ground. We've completed the change-of-shift here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth, has relieved Milton Windler, and our capsule communicator is Astronaut Bruce McCandless. At 146 hours, 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
147:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours. The Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that the crew appeared still to be sleeping, however, we have seen some signs of activity aboard the spacecraft. We suspect they may be awakening shortly. At the present time Apollo 11 is 30,980 nautical miles from the Moon and the speed is 4308 feet per second. The Flight Plan for today is relatively quiet and we are continuing to await the crew's own awakening - we don't plan to awaken them from the ground at this time. At 147 hours, 1 minute, this is Mission Control, Houston.
147:30:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 30 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that the Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, appears to be up at this time. Both Armstrong and Collins appear still to be sleeping. At the present time Apollo 11 is 32,253 nautical miles from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 4303 feet per second. Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth has elected to perform the mid-course correction maneuver scheduled at transearth injection plus 15 hours. That would be at about 150 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The exact time of that mid-course correction is not critical and it could move around somewhat. We expect that it would be a velocity change of about 5 feet per second. We expect there will be some conversation with the crew before too much longer. We'll come back up when we hear from the spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 32 minutes.
147:39:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours, 39 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that all 3 crew are now awake. We expect to be hearing a Good Morning from the spacecraft before too much longer so we'll stand by for that. We said Good Night to the crew last night at about 137 hours, and 47 minutes so they have apparently had a good 10-hour rest period and we'll probably be getting a crew status report indicating just how much sleep each of the crewmen got. We'll stand by for any conversation with the spacecraft.
147:47:11|T|CMP|Good afternoon, Houston. Apollo 11. Over.
147:47:24|T|CC|Good morning, 11. This is Houston. Over.
147:47:31|T|CMP|Okay. Crew status report: 88 and 8.5.
147:47:38|T|CC|Roger. 88 and 8.5. When you're ready, we've got a small Flight Plan update for you.
147:48:14|T|LMP|Houston, we're ready to copy.
147:48:16|T|CC|Roger. At about 148 hours, if you've not already done so, a CO2 filter change, and the H2 purge line heater on 20 minutes before the O2 and H2 purge. At 148 hours, we'd like you to initiate a charge on battery Alfa instead of at 151 hours, and leave the charge on until we notify you further. At 150 hours GET, wastewater dump to 10 percent. We do plan to burn mid-course correction 5. It will be an RCS burn about 5 feet per second at about the nominal time in the Flight Plan. Over.
147:49:24|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. We'll be accomplishing the filter change shortly, the purge line heater is on ***, O2 and H2 purge shortly, and at 148 will initiate a charge on battery A until you notify us further. At 150 hours, wastewater dump to 10 percent. And we're looking forward to mid-course correction 5 at about 5 feet per second at the nominal time. Over.
147:49:52|T|CC|Roger. I've got your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.
147:50:02|T|LMP|Copy.
147:50:04|T|CC|Okay. At GET of 147 plus 00, RCS total minus 2.0 percent, which is about minus 14 pounds. Alfa minus 12.0, Bravo plus 10.0, minus 3.0, minus 2.0. Hydrogen total minus 1.5 pounds, O2 total plus 20 pounds. Over.
147:50:50|T|LMP|Roger. I copy, and our onboard readouts: Alfa, *** 2 percent, Bravo 54 percent, Cocoa's 64 percent, Delta 61 percent. Over.
147:51:19|T|CC|Roger, 11. Would you read that quad Alfa again, please, Buzz. You're cutting out. It may be - are you operating on VOX? Over.
147:51:29|T|LMP|Negative. Alfa is 53 percent. Over.
147:51:36|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
147:51:53|T|CC|11, from down here on telemetry, all your systems look to be in good shape.
148:01:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
148:01:57|T|CMP|Go ahead.
148:01:58|T|CC|Roger. Would you ask Buzz to check his biomedical TM sensors for a loose or dried out sensor? We're getting an erratic electrocardiogram reading. That would be one of the three sternal leads. Over.
148:02:18|T|CMP|Okay.
148:02:45|T|CMP|...
148:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 7 minutes. In about 24 seconds from now, the spacecraft will pass the imaginary line into the Earth's sphere of influence.
148:03:58|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Say again your last, please.
148:04:07|T|CMP|Disregard.
148:04:11|T|CC|Roger. Out.
148:07:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by for a Mark leaving the lunar sphere of influence.
148:07:22|T|CC|MARK.
148:07:23|T|CC|You're leaving the lunar sphere of influence. Over.
148:07:31|T|CMP|Roger. Is Bill Shaffer down there?
148:07:34|T|CC|Negative. But we've got a highly qualified team on in his stead.
148:07:42|T|CMP|Roger. I wanted to hear him explain it again to the press conference.
148:07:50|T|CC|Okay.
148:07:54|T|CMP|That's old Apollo 8 junk, but tell him the spacecraft gave a little jump as it went through the ...
148:07:58|T|CC|Okay. I'll pass it on to him. Thanks a lot, and Dave Reed is sort of burying his head in his arms right now.
148:08:10|T|CMP|Roger. Out.
148:08:15|T|CDR|Those guys down there in the press room did a pretty good job this morning.
148:08:20|T|CC|Yes, they have.
148:08:30|T|CDR|We don't want them to give up yet, though.
148:08:34|T|CC|No. They'll hang in there for about another 47 hours or so.
148:08:39|T|CDR|Okay.
148:13:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours, 21 minutes. At the time the spacecraft crossed from the Moon's sphere of influence to the Earth's sphere of influence, that point at which the Earth is computed as having the dominant influence on the spacecraft trajectory, Apollo 11 was about 33,800 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 174,000 nautical miles from Earth. At the present time, the spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 3994 feet per second with respect to the Earth. After awakening this morning, Neil Armstrong reported all 3 crewmen getting at least 8 hours of sleep. The commander received about - got about 8 hours, the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, about 8 hours, and Armstrong reported that Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, got about 8 and a half hours of sleep.
148:22:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you're not busy now, I can read you up the morning news.
148:23:01|T|LMP|Okay. We're all listening.
148:23:05|T|CC|Say again, 11?
148:23:11|T|LMP|Roger. We're all listening. Go ahead.
148:23:13|T|CC|Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific "research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.
148:26:52|T|LMP|Look up the Dow Jones Industrials for us.
148:26:55|T|CC|Roger. Stand by a minute, please.
148:33:45|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We see you in P00. When you can give us ACCEPT, we have a state vector and target load uplink ready for you.
148:34:15|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. I'm going ahead and start the computer.
148:34:18|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
148:38:41|T|CC|Apollo 11, we've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.
148:38:48|T|CMP|Thank you.
148:43:41|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
148:43:47|T|LMP|Go ahead.
148:43:49|T|CC|Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.
148:44:36|T|CMP|Every flight has to have some disadvantages, I guess.
148:44:40|T|CC|Roger. There is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1 1/2 point rise right after opening.
148:44:55|T|CMP|Well, don't blame the 11 point drop on us, anyway.
148:44:59|T|CC|Roger.
148:45:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.
148:46:00|T|CMP|Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.
148:47:44|T|CC|Roger.
148:47:49|T|CDR|And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...
148:48:28|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much. Out.
148:49:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 58 minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the crew a few minutes ago was for the mid-course correction number 5. That is scheduled to occur 150 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds. It will be a Reaction Control System burn using the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters. With a velocity change of 4.8 feet per second, and that will be retrograde. Primary purpose of the maneuver will be to adjust the entry conditions which is - would primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a Ground Elapsed Time of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured from Lunar Orbit Insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that - before the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and the Moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both bodies. And we would define this as the equal potential point. That will occur at 155 hours 30 minutes. And at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth, 52,543 nautical miles from the Moon. We're now 1 hour 28 minutes 26 seconds from ignition for the mid-course correction 5 maneuver.
148:50:48|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. I have your mid-course correction 5 PAD available when you're ready to copy.
148:50:56|T|LMP|Stand by.
148:51:56|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
148:52:02|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Mid-course correction number 5, RCS/G&N: 26025, pitch and yaw trim NA, TIG 150 29 5453, minus 00048, plus all balls, plus 00001 075 159 328; HA is NA; HP plus 00230 00048 011 00048; sextant star 03 0908 382. Boresite star block, none available. Latitude plus 1102, minus 17204 11803 36275 195 03 33, GDC align, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068, no ullage, of course, four quad thrusting. Over. Readback.
148:53:51|T|LMP|Roger. Mid-course number 5, RCS/G&N: 26025, pitch and yaw NA, 150 29 5453, minus 00048, plus all zeros, plus 00001 075 159 328, NA, plus 00230 00048 011 00048 03 0908 382, NA three times, plus 1102, minus 17204 11803 36275 195 03 33, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068, and four quads for the burn. Over.
148:55:17|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
149:03:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
149:03:18|T|CMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
149:03:20|T|CC|Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.
149:03:33|T|CDR|Go ahead.
149:03:36|T|CC|Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?
149:03:44|T|CDR|I think only in my suit.
149:03:48|T|CC|Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?
149:04:17|T|CDR|I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.
149:04:31|T|CC|Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?
149:04:38|T|CDR|I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.
149:04:44|T|CC|Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.
149:04:57|T|CDR|Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the PC02 gage.
149:05:06|T|CC|Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.
149:05:27|T|LMP|I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.
149:05:33|T|CDR|Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.
149:05:37|T|CC|Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -
149:05:40|T|CDR|No.
149:05:41|T|CC|Go ahead.
149:05:44|T|LMP|I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.
149:06:11|T|CC|Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.
149:06:36|T|CMP|No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.
149:06:40|T|CC|Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.
149:06:51|T|LMP|Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in on jettison? Over.
149:07:00|T|CC|Say again, please?
149:07:04|T|LMP|Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.
149:07:10|T|CC|Yes. It was in.
149:07:17|T|LMP|Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the Command Module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.
149:07:34|T|CC|Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.
149:19:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours, 41 minutes. We're now about 49 minutes away from the first mid-course correction of this transearth leg of the Apollo 11 flight. That maneuver will be a 4.8 foot per second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters and is scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 150 hours, 29 minutes, 54 seconds. At this time Apollo 11 is 171,017 nautical miles from the Earth, and the spacecraft velocity is 4,043 feet per second.
149:24:24|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.
149:24:41|T|LMP|Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.
149:24:53|T|CC|Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.
149:44:27|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
149:44:40|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Over.
149:44:45|T|LMP|Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.
149:44:54|T|CC|Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.
149:45:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 4 minutes. Telemetry data at this time shows the spacecraft in the proper attitude for the upcoming mid-course correction maneuver. The crew will soon be verifying their attitude by taking a sighting on a star through the sextant and will be running some tests on the guidance control system and, the Reaction Control System before the maneuver takes place. That burn now scheduled to come a little over 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 170,102 nautical miles from the Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4058 feet per second.
149:45:07|T|LMP|Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.
149:45:17|T|CC|Okay. If you would, at your convience, we'll be watching it down here.
150:10:00|P|PAO|One minute until mid-course correction number 5. It will be a 10.9 second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters giving a change of velocity retrograde of 4.8 feet per second. The primary purpose of this maneuver will be to control the spacecraft flight path angle at entry interface. We're now less that 30 seconds from the initiation of the burn.
150:10:00|P|PAO|They should be burning at this time. And we show the burn off.
150:10:00|P|PAO|That mid-course correction was performed at a distance of about 169,000 nautical miles from the Earth at a spacecraft velocity of 4075.6 feet per second.
150:10:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to try acquisition on the high-gain antenna for us at pitch minus 90, yaw 270. Over.
150:10:33|T|CDR|Roger. That's in work.
150:10:37|T|CC|Roger. Out.
150:12:36|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're showing about 6.8 percent on wastewater on our telemetry now. Over.
150:12:48|T|CMP|Okay. We've got about 9, up here. Over.
150:12:51|T|CC|Roger. Out.
150:28:31|T|CC|11, Houston. We're standing by for your burn. Everything's looking good from down here.
150:28:39|T|LMP|Thank you, Bruce. You've got about a minute and 20 seconds.
150:28:42|T|CC|Roger. We concur.
150:31:16|T|CMP|Houston, do you copy our residuals?
150:31:33|T|CC|Roger. We've got your residual fuel counter reading for us.
150:31:43|T|CMP|DELTA-VC is plus 0.2.
150:31:46|T|CC|Roger. Plus 0.2.
150:31:50|T|CMP|That was actually plus 100.2. Okay?
150:31:54|T|CC|Okay.
150:35:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours, 35 minutes. Our telemetry data here on the ground shows that a mid-course correction maneuver just about nominal, burn duration 10.5 seconds. Prior to the maneuver, we were predicting a splashdown time of 195 hours, 17 minutes, 25 seconds. And we expect there will be some modification to that after we've had a chance to do some tracking following this mid-course correction maneuver. Apollo 11 is now 168,843 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 4078 feet per second and we're continuing to see a very slow buildup in the Velocity.
150:43:34|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
150:43:38|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
150:43:43|T|CMP|Roger. We're in PTC attitude and would you please give us a call when our thruster activity has subsided sufficiently?
150:43:52|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
150:56:41|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're going to hand over from Madrid to Goldstone at 151 hours even. If you should lose lock on the high-gain at this time, you may reaquire at pitch minus 45, yaw 270. Break. We're still watching your rates. Over.
150:57:05|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
151:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 151 hours 11 minutes. The crew is presently setting up the spacecraft for Passive Thermal Control. Once it stabilizes out it will begin a slow roll rate of three revolutions per hour to maintain temperature control. At the present time Apollo 11 is 167,448 nautical miles from the Earth and the velocity is 4,101 feet per second.
151:08:49|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
151:08:56|T|CDR|This is 11, Houston.
151:09:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
151:09:15|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
151:09:17|T|CC|11, we're still seeing rates on your spacecraft above those we would like for the continuation of the PTC mode which we are still monitoring, and we'll advise you when it has settled down. Over.
151:09:34|T|CDR|Okay.
151:11:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 29 minutes. In the process of reestablishing the Passive Thermal Control with the spacecraft in a slow rotation, we have apparently lost high-gain lock on and we expect that the crew will reacquire lock with the antenna once the Passive Thermal Control is reestablished. At the present time Apollo 11 is 164 thousand 320 nautical miles from the Earth and the velocity is up now to 4 thousand 156 feet per second. We'll continue to stand by here for reacquisition of the spacecraft, for reestablishment of high-gain lock on.
151:21:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are go for the spinup on PTC. Over.
151:22:59|T|CDR|Thank you.
151:24:23|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
151:24:27|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
151:24:32|T|CDR|Roger. It didn't like it that time. When I got down to the entry 27303 ENTER, it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of 1 degree per second. Over. I've stopped it now, and we are going to have to go back and do it over again. I'd like to try to find out the reason it did that.
151:24:55|T|CC|Roger. You might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here.
151:25:02|T|CDR|Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?
151:25:07|T|CC|That's affirmative.
151:25:11|T|CDR|Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.
151:25:20|T|CC|Roger.
151:25:50|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.
151:26:06|T|CC|Roger. We'll check it out.
151:33:33|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.
151:33:53|T|CDR|Go ahead.
151:33:57|T|CDR|Go ahead, Bruce.
151:33:59|T|CC|Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts onboard? Over.
151:34:24|T|CDR|Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.
151:34:31|T|CC|Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.
151:35:18|T|CDR|We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.
151:36:22|T|CDR|We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.
151:36:58|T|CC|Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.
151:37:25|T|LMP|It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.
151:38:10|T|CC|Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.
151:38:18|T|LMP|Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.
151:38:58|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. We copy.
151:39:02|T|LMP|And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.
151:39:07|T|CDR|And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.
151:39:15|T|CC|Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.
151:39:56|T|CDR|Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.
151:41:17|T|CC|Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.
151:41:28|T|CDR|Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.
151:42:28|T|CC|Roger. We copy,
151:42:50|T|CC|Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.
151:43:00|T|CDR|Okay.
151:43:50|T|CDR|My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.
151:43:58|T|CC|Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.
151:46:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
151:46:27|T|CMP|Go ahead.
151:46:29|T|CC|11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.
151:47:08|T|CMP|Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?
151:47:17|T|CC|Stand by a minute, Mike.
151:52:17|T|CC|11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.
151:52:25|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
151:52:27|T|CC|Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.
151:53:09|T|CMP|Roger, that. I was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done.
151:53:17|T|CC|Roger. We're still working on computing the rate for you.
151:53:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to select REACQ mode on the high-gain antenna. Looks like we're about to lose you. Over.
151:56:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 9 minutes. At this time, the crew is getting the spacecraft set up to re-initiate the Passive Thermal Control. Apollo 11 currently 165,143 nautical miles from the Earth and traveling at a speed of 4,142 feet per second. The Flight Plan has relatively few activities scheduled for now through the beginning of the crew sleep period tonight. We do have a television transmission scheduled. I believe, the time on that is a little after 8:00 PM Central Daylight Time. And we show the sleep period to begin at about 160 hours Ground Elapsed Time, or a little less than 8 hours from now. We'll continue to stand by for any conversation with the crew. It has been relatively quiet for a good part of today. We'll stand by for a call from the Capcom or from the spacecraft down to the ground.
152:17:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. If you read us, attempt to acquire on OMNI antennas. Attempt to acquire us on OMNI antennas, if you read. This is Houston. Out.

152:43:48|T|CT|... Goldstone.
152:43:54|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
152:46:15|T|CT|...
152:46:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
152:46:51|T|CMP|Loud and clear, Bruce. How me?
152:46:54|T|CC|Roger. What antenna are you using?
152:47:27|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11 is calling you on the high-gain. How do you read? Over.
152:47:31|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear on the high-gain.
152:47:48|T|CMP|So what's new?
152:47:51|T|CC|Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there.
152:47:56|T|CMP|It's all very quiet. We're just sitting here letting the thruster firing damp down. When they get good enough, let us know, and we'll start this PTC.
152:48:06|T|CC|Roger.
152:48:29|T|CMP|Nice to sit here and watch the Earth getting larger and larger and the Moon smaller and smaller.
152:48:37|T|CC|Roger. We'll give you a call when your rates have damped down sufficiently, and we're unable at the present time to predict what rate you should have seen at your last attempt to initiate PTC. We saw about 2 1/2 degrees per second. Over.
152:48:57|T|CMP|Yes. I believe that.
152:49:21|T|CMP|Buzz thinks we should have a PTC program built in the computer. He could very well be right.
152:51:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 153 hours, 7 minutes. At the present time, we are changing shifts here in Mission Control. Flight Director Gene Kranz will be coming on to relieve Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be astronaut Charlie Duke. There will be a change-of-shift briefing in the news center, in the building 1 auditorium in about 10 minutes. At the present time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of 4,185 feet per second. The spacecraft is about 162,700 nautical miles from the Earth. During the change-of-shift briefing, we will take the circuit down. Record any conversation that develops with the spacecraft and play it back following the change-of-shift briefing. At 153 hours, 9 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
153:19:17|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
153:19:21|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
153:19:27|T|CMP|Roger. I was just checking the radios, and how is the thruster activity coming?
153:19:51|T|CC|11, Houston. The radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We've got 0.03 degrees per second in pitch now.
153:20:05|T|CMP|Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up. We've got the Earth steady out window 1. We have the Moon steadily out window 3 and, of course, we are locked up on the high-gain. So as long as the thermal people are happy, we're happy.
153:20:29|T|CC|Roger. We copy.
153:33:27|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
153:33:33|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
153:33:35|T|CC|Okay, 11. We are about ready to start PTC. I would like to give you some high-gain antenna angles, though. We'd like to operate in the REACQ mode, and do you plan on spinning up in the positive or negative direction? Over.
153:33:52|T|CMP|We can do it either way. I had planned the positive.
153:33:55|T|CC|Okay. For positive, the high-gain antenna setting should be pitch plus 30, yaw 270, and in REACQ. Over.
153:34:10|T|CMP|Understand. REACQ, pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Thank you.
153:34:14|T|CC|Roger. And if you would, when you're making your DSKY entries to set up for PTC, go a little slower, and we'll try to follow each entry from down here. Over.
153:34:28|T|CMP|Roger that.
153:39:47|T|CMP|Houston, 11. PTC established.
153:39:50|T|CC|Roger, 11.
153:43:05|T|CC|11, Houston. We observe the PTC to be fairly well established here, and we'll keep you posted on how it's going, and your friendly White Team commentator is taking over now.
153:43:23|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks to all you Black Team.
153:43:26|T|CC|That was the Green Team.
153:43:28|T|CMP|Correction, all you Green Team - correction, Green Team. Excuse me.
153:43:32|T|CC|Roger. Out.
153:43:48|T|CMP|How could I forget. I used to be a "Green" one.
153:45:42|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Your White Team is now on. We're standing by for an exciting evening of TV and a presleep report. Over.
153:45:42|T||(Unidentifiable Noise)
153:49:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 153 hours 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11, homeward bound, is now 161,015 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now 4,216 feet per second. Some 3 1/2 minutes of recorded air to ground transmissions have accumulated during the recent change-of-shift Press Conference here in Apollo News Center. Let's play that tape back now.
153:53:12|T|SC|(Laughter)
153:53:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You sure you don't have anybody else in there with you?
153:53:38|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Say again, please.
153:53:41|T|CC|We had some strange noises coming down on the downlink, and it sounded like you had some friends up there.
153:53:55|T|CDR|Where - where do the White Team go during their off hours anyway?
153:53:59|T|CC|Say again.
153:53:59|T||(Unidentifiable Noise)
153:53:59|T||(Unindentifiable Noise)
153:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still no explanation, the weird noises emanating from Apollo 11, if indeed it is from Apollo 11 and it's reported from network that it's being received on the downlink at two different stations in the Manned Space Flight Network. Perhaps it will all shake out later in the mission as to what these strange noises are. We'll come back up again as conversation is resumed with Apollo 11 now 160,410 nautical miles out from Earth traveling at 4228 feet per second. At 154 hours, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
154:40:58|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
154:41:05|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
154:41:07|T|CC|Roger. Would you ver - We've lost COMM with you for about the last 10 minutes. Would you verify that the S band track switch is in REACQ? Over.
154:41:17|T|LMP|Negative. It's not. The last time we broke lock, we went to AUTO, and I left it there. Sorry.
154:41:22|T|CC|Roger. We'd like to have you to put it in REACQ, and monitor. In about 2 minutes, we'll be coming up on the high-gain. Would you monitor the REACQ? If it doesn't take, acquire manually. Over.
154:41:39|T|LMP|Okay. Say again the angles you'd like.
154:41:42|T|CC|We'll - we'll try to switch it ourselves. Stand by on the angles.
154:41:52|T|CC|Buzz, it's pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Over.
154:41:58|T|LMP|Roger. I've got them.
154:42:01|T|CC|Thank you.
154:46:11|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you please terminate battery charge now? Over.
154:46:19|T|LMP|Roger. Terminating battery charge.
154:46:22|T|CC|Roger.
154:50:51|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Any special attitude you'd like us to look at for the TV? Over.
154:51:09|T|CDR|I don't guess we have a requirement there, Charlie.
154:51:14|T|CC|Roger. We have an attitude that we can get the Earth out of a window or the Moon. We're trying to look at - find one that we can get both, if that's what you'd like. Over.
154:51:33|T|CMP|A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Joe.
154:51:37|T|CC|Roger.
154:51:49|T|LMP|That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.
154:52:03|T|CC|Roger. Well, we'll just stop on the 50 roll, then, and we'll give you the word when to do that. Over.
154:52:09|T|CMP|Okay.
154:53:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 154 hours, 53 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 40 hours, 9 minutes to entry. Apollo 11 homeward bound 158,378 nautical miles out from Earth velocity now 4267 feet per second. We have some 3 minutes of tape accumulated over the past half hour of minor conversations with the crew of Apollo 11. We'll roll these tapes now.
154:53:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That completes, the accumulation of air to ground communications by means of tape recordings on the last half hour or so. It's quiet right now. No conversation going on between Spacecraft Communicator Charlie Duke and the crew of Apollo 11. And at 154 hours, 57 minutes ground lapsed time this is Apollo Control.
155:23:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have high-gain coverage about 155 30. At that time, you can turn on the TV if you desire, and continue your roll around until you get 50 degrees roll. Over.
155:23:26|T|CDR|Okay.
155:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 155 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up now about 3 minutes away from tonight's television pass. It'll be through the 85-foot antenna at the Goldstone tracking station. The 210 foot dish out there is tied up tracking one of the Mars fly-by missions. We have some 20 seconds of tape accumulated. We'll play that back and rejoin the conversation line.
155:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control still standing by for the incoming television signal from Columbia. Still nothing but the color bar test pattern as of now. Continuing to stand by on air to ground and television links.
155:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. While we're waiting for the television pictures to come in, we have in the Control Room here a vase full of long-stemmed red roses, the card saying, "To one and all concerned. Job superbly done. From a Moonstruck Canadian." Continuing to stand by as we wait for the pictures to come from Columbia. Here they come.
155:28:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We were going to give you the All Star game tonight, but it was rained out. Over.
155:28:35|T|SC|...
155:30:05|T|CC|11, Houston. We're on the high-gain. You can warm up the SM now if you like. Over.
155:32:45|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see you coming up on 50 roll. How does that attitude look? Over.
155:34:52|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for the TV; we're all configured. At your convenience. Over.
155:36:45|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
155:36:46|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.
155:36:50|T|CDR|Are you picking up our TV signals?
155:36:52|T|CC|That's affirmative. We have it up on the Eidephor now. The focus is a little bit out. We see the Earth in the center of the screen. Still have a little white dot in the bottom of the camera, apparently. And see some landmasses in the center, at least I guess that's what it is. It's very hazy at this time on our Eidephor. Over.
155:37:16|T|CC|Let me change - -
155:37:17|T|CMP|I believe that's where we just came from.
155:37:20|T|CC|It is, huh? Well, I'm really looking at the bad - at a bad screen here. Stand by one. Hey, you're right.
155:37:44|T|CMP|It's not bad enough not finding the right landing spot - -
155:37:45|T|CC|... screen now.
155:37:51|T|CMP|It's not bad enough not finding the right landing spot when you haven't even got the right planet!
155:37:56|T|CC|I'll never live that one down.
155:38:05|T|CMP|We're making it get smaller and smaller here to make sure that it really is the one we're leaving.
155:38:12|T|CC|All right. That's enough you guys.
155:38:19|T|CDR|Okay. That's enough of the Moon, Charlie. We're getting set up now for some inside pictures.
155:38:24|T|CC|11, that was a good picture there.
155:38:26|T|CDR|Okay. That's enough of the Moon.
155:38:32|T|CC|Roger.
155:40:42|T|CDR|We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the Command Module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship, I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.
155:42:17|T|CC|Roger, Neil. Thank you much for that description. We've got a pretty dark picture down here. Could you check your f stop? We'd like to have it - See if you can open it up a little bit. Over.
155:42:20|T|LMP|Okay. Our monitor showed that to be very bright.
155:42:22|T|CC|Roger.
155:42:23|T|CDR|... We're down around between, well around f:4, which we thought would be plenty light. Well, we'll lighten it up some more.
155:42:31|T|CC|Well, we'd appreciate it. It's pretty dark on all our monitors here.
155:42:39|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
155:42:43|T|CC|It's looking a lot better now, Neil.
155:42:49|T|CC|There's Buzz.
155:43:14|T|CC|11, Houston. We have an excellent picture now. Over.
155:43:19|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read me, Charlie?
155:43:21|T|CC|Five by now, Buzz. Over.
155:43:24|T|LMP|Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that we've left the Moon, I'd like to trace through them a little bit for you *** developments that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already *** type of a drink container. A little later, Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially, this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with water, and the drink then dissolves in the water, and this end of the *** outfeeding. Likewise, we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can probably see this shrimp cocktail meal. *** this afternoon while the two of us had salmon salad. *** another early development was the use of bite size food ***
155:44:37|T|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you're breaking up badly. Will you check your VOX? Over.
155:44:47|T|LMP|Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?
155:44:49|T|CC|Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.
155:44:57|T|LMP|Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.
155:46:17|T|LMP|I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to *** you're all very familiar with.
155:46:44|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high-gain shortly. Over.
155:47:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still up live with the air to ground circuit to Apollo 11 homeward bound. Now in the Passive Thermal Control mode, or barbecue mode, Charlie Duke is going to make another call to the crew. Let's listen in, in a moment. He's discussing with Flight Director Deke Frank, who tonight is spelling Gene Kranz on this shift, although Gene is here. They're discussing some adjustments to the Passive Thermal Control mode. Apollo 11 has left the Moon some 53,666 miles behind it. And relative to the Moon, Apollo 11 is traveling now at 4306 feet per second. Continue to monitor air to ground here till the crew settles down. They're not scheduled to go into their rest period until about another 4 hours from now.
155:47:03|T|LMP|You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.
155:47:53|T|LMP|See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.
155:48:12|T|CMP|Too close, I think.
155:48:32|T|CC|11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.
155:48:46|T|CMP|Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?
155:49:07|T|CC|That's affirmative, 11.
155:49:12|T|CMP|Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?
155:49:27|T|CC|Okay.
155:49:35|T|CMP|And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.
155:50:04|T|CMP|That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.
155:50:15|T|CMP|Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.
155:50:58|T|CMP|It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.
155:51:14|T|CC|Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.
155:51:23|T|CMP|Roger. Stand by one, and we'll get you that Earth one.
155:51:29|T|CC|Looks like you need a wine skin up there, Mike.
155:51:35|T|CMP|That'd be nice.
155:52:50|T|CMP|Okay.
155:52:54|T|CC|11, Houston - -
155:52:55|T|CMP|You have a picture now, Houston?
155:52:56|T|CC|That's affirmative. I refuse to bite on this one, though. You tell us.
155:53:02|T|CDR|Okay. This should be getting larger, and if it is, it's the place we're coming home to.
155:53:12|T|CC|Roger.
155:53:40|T|CDR|No matter where you travel, it's always nice to get home.
155:53:46|T|CC|We concur, 11. We'll be happy to have you back.
155:53:53|T|CDR|This is Apollo 11. Signing off.
155:53:56|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much, 11. That was a good demonstration and a good show. We appreciate it very much.
155:57:00|P|PAO|This is Delta Launch Control. We have postponed the launch of the Delta vehicle tonight. The launch of INTELSAT 3, 24 hours. The reason for this postponement is to examine the second stage propellant ground equipment. There is a slight chance that the acid used in the second stage for an oxidizer inhibited red fuming nitric acid, could have contained an excessive level of contaminants. This possibility is the most that there is a desire to make the examination. During fueling today, it was noticed that the transfer of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid took longer than expected, or longer than normal. In examining the ground equipment, it was found that a filter element had dislodged and had traveled approximately 2 feet into the line. There is need now to insure, that in fact, the displacement of this filter was what caused the slowdown and also a need now to analyze the IRFNA, or inhibited red fuming nitric acid to insure that no contamination is evident. The launch has been rescheduled for 24 hours from now, or 24 hours from 10:00 PM tonight. This has been cleared with the range. We have the same launch window tomorrow night. 10:00 PM to 11:10 PM. This is Delta Launch Control.
155:57:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apparently, there will be little conversation in the next half hour or so. Apollo 11 now 155,000 as you were - Yes, 155,906 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 4,316 feet per second. And at 156 hours 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
155:57:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw on 10. Over.
155:57:39|T|CMP|It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.
155:57:58|T|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.
155:58:07|T|CMP|No, we haven't, as a matter of fact. It's been dry in that area since we got rid of that last time.
155:58:14|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
155:58:47|T|CMP|Apollo 11 is back in PTC attitude. Standing by for thruster quieting.
155:58:53|T|CC|Roger. We see that. Thank you much, Mike.
156:07:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you get a little summary of the evening news for us?
156:07:26|T|CC|Yes, sir. We'll have it for you momentarily. Also, a little Flight Plan update, Mike. If you - On page 31-13, you can delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.
156:07:38|T|CMP|Will do.
156:07:45|T|CC|There is a flurry of activity in the PAO site for the evening news.
156:07:52|T|CMP|Bully.
156:08:03|T|CMP|How's the weather down there? You got any rain?
156:08:05|T|CC|Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, and it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.
156:08:26|T|CMP|Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.
156:08:41|T|CC|Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have cleared up outside now, according to some of the people coming in. This constant overcast in the MOCR here is a little hard to see outside.
156:08:58|T|LMP|Yes. We also noticed it was a little overcast down over - in the Antarctic ice cap, too.
156:09:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. After first saying that there would be very little conversation, it seems there's quite a flurry of conversation between the ground and Apollo 11. Let's play back tapes and catch up and go live.
156:09:05|T|CC|Roger. It's apparently raining pretty hard up - -
156:09:08|T|CMP|How's that for one-upsmanship?
156:09:10|T|CC|Yes. (Laughter).
156:09:16|T|CDR|He may know that, but he doesn't even know whether his grass is wet or dry.
156:09:25|T|CC|It's apparently raining fairly hard up in Washington where the All Star game was to be played tonight. They started out, I understand, and then it was rained out and they called it off.
156:09:36|T|CMP|They need a roof on their stadium so they can catch all those flys.
156:09:39|T|CC|Roger.
156:09:41|T|CMP|In the rain.
156:09:43|T|CC|Touche.
156:10:01|T|LMP|Hey, Charlie, what's the preliminary outlook for the weather in our recovery area?
156:10:05|T|CC|Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - FLIGHT just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast. are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.
156:11:35|T|CC|Navy called up those special calm seas for you guys from up there on the Hudson.
156:11:43|T|LMP|Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess, though. We'll probably be giving it a pretty close eye.
156:11:49|T|CC|Roger.
156:14:03|T|CC|11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non nominal stowage that we have onboard. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.
156:14:22|T|CMP|Roger. We'll do some work on that and let you know, Charlie.
156:14:27|T|CC|Thank you, sir.
156:14:44|T|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please place O2 tank 1 heater to AUTO? Over.
156:14:55|T|CMP|AUTO it is.
156:17:02|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11.
156:17:04|T|CC|Go ahead.
156:17:10|T|CDR|What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the Command Module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.
156:18:07|T|CC|Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Out.
156:18:12|T|CDR|Roger.
156:22:12|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got the rates looking copacetic. You can go ahead and initiate PTC. Over.
156:22:22|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
156:22:24|T|CC|And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.
156:22:55|T|LMP|Roger. How many did you want me to change?
156:22:57|T|CC|Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into
156:23:24|T|LMP|Okay. There's three of them, is that right?
156:23:26|T|CC|That's affirmative.
156:23:30|T|LMP|And you want me to change all three.
156:23:32|T|CC|That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.
156:23:46|T|LMP|Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?
156:23:52|T|CC|No. We do not.
156:24:02|T|LMP|Well, I can show you my heart's still working.
156:24:06|T|CC|We believe it.
156:24:23|T|CDR|Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?
156:24:38|T|CC|Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.
156:26:23|T|LMP|Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDR at this point.
156:26:32|T|CC|Roger. Stand by.
156:26:42|T|CC|11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.
156:26:56|T|LMP|Okay.
156:26:58|T|CC|Thank you.
156:38:12|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
156:38:14|T|CC|Go ahead, sir.
156:38:18|T|LMP|Roger. I think the problem was that the center lead had dried out. ... put the new one on, and I'll see how that works. Over.
156:38:32|T|CC|Roger.
156:38:36|T|LMP|I can't tell you how good it feels to get it off.
156:38:38|T|CC|Yes. I can imagine.
156:48:41|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Houston, Apollo 11.
156:48:42|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
156:48:45|T|LMP|Roger. How do you read my EKG now?
156:48:48|T|CC|Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high-gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.
156:49:04|T|LMP|Okay. I got my high-gain antenna coming out.
156:49:11|T|CC|Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.
156:52:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.
156:52:47|T|LMP|Okay. They're welcome.
156:55:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Things are beginning to quieten down aboard Apollo 11 as they get nearer their sleep period. There probably won't be too many more exchanges between spacecraft communicator Charlie Duke here in Mission Control and the crew aboard Columbia. Entry countdown clock now showing 37 hours 53 minutes this may be refined a
156:55:00|P|PAO|few times between now and splash time, or entry. Apollo 11 now is 153 thousand and 80 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 4 thousand 3 hundred 73 feet per second. And at 157 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
157:03:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our tracking since the mid-course, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor and everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination.
157:05:50|T|CC|And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V. And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.
157:06:37|T|CMP|I take it all back.
157:06:40|T|CC|You need more practice.
157:53:37|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Buzz, you brought the surgeon right out of his chair. We see you exercising. Over.
157:53:49|T|CDR|Say again.
157:53:50|T|CC|We see you exercising. Is that correct, Buzz?
157:53:54|T|CDR|Yes, that's right. Buzz is.
157:53:57|T|CC|Roger. We've got his heartbeat way up.
157:54:03|T|CDR|Right. He's sort of out of shape.
157:54:06|T|CC|Yes. That's what we thought.
157:56:32|T|CMP|White Team's really got a busy one tonight, huh, Charlie?
157:56:36|T|CC|Say again, Mike. Over.
157:56:41|T|CMP|Say the old White Team's really got a busy one tonight, huh?
157:56:43|T|CC|Oh, boy. We're really booming along here with all this activity. Can barely believe it.
157:56:51|T|CMP|What are you doing? Sitting around with your feet up on the console drinking coffee?
157:56:55|T|CC|(Laughter) You must have your X ray eyes up. You sure can see a long way.
157:57:05|T|CMP|Yes. We're watching you as well, you know.
157:57:07|T|CC|All right.
157:57:27|T|CMP|Two people in the viewing room and that's more than is in the trench.
157:57:42|T|CC|We've got eight in the viewing room, and let's see, about six in the trench right now. And this is the highlight of the day; Buzz's exercise for the surgeon.
157:58:10|T|CC|11, you copy? Over.
157:58:15|T|CDR|Roger. 11.
157:58:17|T|CC|Roger. Neil has the highest heartbeat ever seen on a manned space flight, and we just went low bit rate. The surgeon is about to die. (Laughter)
157:58:35|T|CDR|I measured it up here. It came out to be 247.
157:58:45|T|CC|Boy, that's super.
157:59:01|T|CMP|The unit's on that furlong per fortnight.
157:59:04|T|CC|Roger. We copy that. EECOMM says if you keep that up, you're going to have to change your CO2 canister.
157:59:15|T|CMP|You were going to make me do that in another 45 minutes anyway.
157:59:19|T|CC|That's true.
157:59:26|T|CMP|That's the highlight of my day. I'm really looking forward to that.
157:59:26|T||(Music: "Music Out of the Moon")
158:01:00|T|CC|Thank you, 11. We appreciate you turning that off. (Laughter)
158:01:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 158 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time. There's been a certain amount of conversation between Charlie Duke here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. We'll play back the accumulated tape at this time and then rejoin the conversation when it does resume on a live basis. Let's roll the tape now.
158:03:24|T|CDR|Charlie, could you copy our music down there?
158:03:28|T|CC|Did we copy what, Neil?
158:03:32|T|CDR|Did you copy our music down there?
158:03:33|T|CC|Roger. We sure did. We're wondering who selected - made your selections?
158:03:41|T|CDR|That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."
158:03:49|T|CC|Roger. It sounded a little scratchy to us, Neil. Either that or your tape was a little slow.
158:04:01|T|CDR|It's supposed to sound that way.
158:04:03|T|CC|That's one of those - -
158:04:04|T|CMP|- - it sounds a little scratchy to us too, but the czar likes it.
158:04:09|T|CC|That's what we figured. He and his 40,000 votes.
158:04:24|T|CC|For your info, we got you - It looks like about 150,000 out now.
158:04:31|T|MS|...
158:04:33|T|CMP|It's getting appreciably larger now. It's looking more like the world.
158:04:38|T|CC|Roger. I'm looking at the right side of the screen this time.
158:04:42|T|CMP|How's everything going on the - Say again, Charlie?
158:04:45|T|CC|Oh, just - I - I'll never hear the last of that one about that Earth/Moon business during the TV there, and I was just saying that I was looking at the right side of the board here, so you are going towards the Earth. What are - What were you going to say, Mike?
158:05:01|T|CMP|You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?
158:05:05|T|CC|It's 2:30. Everybody will be asleep. I going to sneak off through the back way.
158:05:13|T|CMP|Okay. I was just wondering how everything is going at the home front. All the wives and kids in one piece?
158:05:19|T|CC|Roger. Sure are. Everything's doing fine. All the gals are having a little party tonight, as far as I know.
158:05:27|T|CMP|Oh, good. Glad to hear it.
158:20:40|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.
158:21:06|T|CMP|Yes. I'm all ears.
158:21:08|T|CC|Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.
158:21:21|T|CMP|Okay. I got it.
158:21:22|T|CC|Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDUs; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDUs, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.
158:22:48|T|CMP|Okay. I got you.
158:22:50|T|CC|Roger.
158:22:51|T|CMP|Man.
158:23:24|T|LMP|Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?
158:23:34|T|CC|I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDUs. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.
158:24:03|T|LMP|Roger.
158:24:05|T|CC|- - We're very scratchy.
158:24:08|T|LMP|Okay.
158:24:43|T|CC|11, Houston. We got you back now on the high-gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.
158:24:51|T|LMP|Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?
158:25:17|T|CC|Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.
158:25:30|T|LMP|Okay.
158:25:42|T|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.
158:25:55|T|LMP|Yes. I got that. Thank you.
158:25:57|T|CC|You're welcome.
158:33:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got a recommendation for you on your stowage of the EVVA's. Over.
158:33:39|T|LMP|Go ahead.
158:33:41|T|CC|Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.
158:34:01|T|CDR|I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.
158:34:20|T|CC|Roger.
158:34:22|T|CDR|Yes. I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay sealed up.
158:34:26|T|CC|Okay. We - -
158:34:27|T|CMP|It won't hack B1, Charlie, with the cover. I tried it already.
158:34:31|T|CC|Okay. Fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd - You check it out. Sounds like you've already done that, so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.
158:34:44|T|LMP|Okay. There's no problem. We'll let you know where they end up.
158:34:47|T|CC|Roger.
158:36:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had no communications with Apollo 11 in the last several minutes. So, at this time, 158 hours 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, we will take down the circuit and come back up when and if conversation resumes prior to the time the crew starts their rest period, which tonight is scheduled for 10 hours. 158 hours 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
159:49:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 159 hours 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew is giving their final report prior to their starting their 10 hour rest period. We've got a little accumulation of tape, then we'll join live. Let's roll the tape now.
159:49:04|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
159:49:06|T|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.
159:49:10|T|CDR|Okay. Crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11020, CMP 10022, LMP 09024. No medication.
159:49:28|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
159:49:35|T|CC|And, Neil, we got - we'd like your onboard readouts of batteries and RCS. Over.
159:49:43|T|CDR|Okay.
159:50:54|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Ready to copy?
159:50:56|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.
159:50:59|T|CDR|Okay. BATT C, PYRO BATT A, and PYRO BATT B are 37.0. RCS A, 51; B, 63; C, 63; D, 59. Go.
159:51:00|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy. Over.
159:51:02|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. It's an entry PAD, MPL, starting with roll 05, 35 - correction - 359 152 001. GET 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203, 068, NOUN 60, 36194 656 11894 36275 195 03 03 0027, NOUN 69, all four lines are NA. Picking up with D zero: 400 02 09. RET of blackout, 00 17 03 38 08 20. Sextant star, 02 0945 149. Boresight star is Scorpii theta, that's Scorpii theta. Up 315, right 35, lift vector up. And the comments: This entry PAD assumes no mid-course 6. And for your information, looking at it right now, based on all the tracking we got, that maneuver would only be a tenth of a foot per second. So, we'll probably skip it. We'll let you know more about that later. Okay. Your horizon check at EI minus 30 minutes, GET of 194 33 03, gives you a pitch angle of 298. Okay. The GDC, your backup align - Your set stars for the entry REFSMMAT are Deneb and Vega, 079 234 340. Standing by for your readback. Over.
159:51:14|T|CC|Roger. Copy all that, Neil. And we got an entry PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
159:55:27|T|LMP|Roger. Lunar entry, MPL: 359 152 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 068 36194 656 11894 36275; 195 03 03 0027, four NA, 400 02 09 00 17 03 38 08 20 02 0945 149, Scorpii theta.

159:56:04|T|CC|Roger. Very good readback, Buzz, and for your communication setup for tonight's sleep, we'd like OMNI to OMNI. Stand by.
159:57:50|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If you didn't copy that, Buzz, it was a good readback on the PAD. We've got a clock update for you that we'll have to you as soon as we can get it out to the site. We're in the process of handing over to Honeysuckle, and it will be a couple of minutes. Over.
159:58:10|T|LMP|Okay. You want the computer to BLOCK?
159:58:14|T|CC|We'll call you. You can stay BLOCK right now. We'll give you a call.
159:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Crew of Columbia at this time should be getting ready to start their 10-hour rest period after having been tucked in by spacecraft communicator Charlie Duke here in Mission Control. At 160 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
159:59:54|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you please give us P00 and ACCEPT? We've got a clock update for you.
160:00:12|T|CMP|Go ahead, Charlie. We're P00 and ACCEPT.
160:00:20|T|CC|Roger.
160:02:17|T|CC|11, HOUSTON. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
160:02:24|T|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
160:02:31|T|CC|And 11, Houston. One final thing. We'd like you to select your OMNI to OMNI, OMNI A to Bravo, high-gain track to MANUAL, and beam WIDE. Your angles are 270 in yaw, pitch minus 50. Over.
160:02:55|T|LMP|Roger. Fifty and minus 70.
160:03:03|T|CC|The angles, Buzz, were yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.
160:03:12|T|LMP|Okay. Yaw 270, pitch minus 50.
160:03:18|T|CC|That's Roger.
160:03:27|T|CC|And Apollo 11, it's good night from a sleepy White Team. Over.
160:03:37|T|LMP|Roger. Thank you very much. We're not as sleepy tonight as we were last night.
160:03:45|T|CC|Yes. I guess you guys were pretty tired last night after that busy day.
160:03:53|T|CMP|That's affirmative. I couldn't even find the chlorine.
160:03:56|T|CC|(Laughing) Yes.
160:25:45|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Sorry to bother you, but we'd like to have you do a VERB 34 to get the NOUN 65 off of there. Over.
161:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 161 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Columbia is now in a 10 hour sleep period. The official time they went to sleep according to the surgeon, Dr. Cannon Biers is 160 hours, 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, almost an hour ago. The Columbia now is 141,369 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 1,628 feet per second. Entry clock now showing 33 hours, 34 minutes to entry or 400,000 feet altitude. Here at Mission Control the Black Team of Flight Controllers headed up by Glen Lunnie is moving in to take over for the next eight hours or so. Spacecraft communicator, Charlie Duke will be replaced by Ron Evans, who just entered the room. And at 161 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
162:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control at 162 hours, 28 minutes. The Apollo 11 spacecraft Columbia is 138,674 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 4692 feet per second. Spacecraft weight, 26,000 pounds. Flight director Glen Lunney has just completed a status check with all of the Flight Controllers here, has gotten very good reports from all of them. The retrofire office here reports that on the present trajectory, Columbia's entry angle is minus 6.56 degrees. The nominal entry angle is minus 6.51 degrees. Retro expects entry velocity to be 36,194 feet per second. He calls these entry conditions excellent. The flight dynamics officer says that tracking is looking very good. Guidance navigation control officer reports the Passive Thermal Control stable, operating very well. Reaction Control System looking very good. ECOMM, the electrical environmental communications office reports cryogenics well balanced. The environmental control system looking good. All of the antennas and the power status in good shape. And, the Flight Surgeon reports the crew sleeping soundly. His data indicates all three crewmen were asleep by 160 hours, 42 minutes, and he reports they have taken no medication. In recovery reports, the weather looks very good in recovery area, and all conditions there are ready for a successful recovery. This is Mission Control at Houston.
163:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 163 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 135,920 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,758 feet per second. The crew's been asleep almost three hours now. All systems still performing welt. This is Mission Control Houston.
164:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 164 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 133,131 nautical miles from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4827 feet per second. Crew is asleep. Performance of all systems continues to be normal. We're 30 hours 34 minutes 37 seconds away from entry of Apollo 11 into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.
165:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 165 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 130,306 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 4,900 feet per second. Crew is still asleep and all systems are still performing well. This is Mission Control, Houston.

The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported today that weather conditions for the landing of Apollo 11 tomorrow expected to be acceptable. Some showers have been reported near the landing area, but these are expected to move westward, leaving the recovery area with partly cloudy skies, east-north easterly winds 10 to 15 knots and 4-foot seas. Although tropical storms will not affect weather in the landing area, the Apollo 11 crew should get a good view of the tropical storm Viola, located in the western North Pacific, and also the remains of the tropical storm Claudia, located southeast of Hawaii. This is Mission Control, Houston.
167:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 167 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 124,520 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 5055 feet per second. All still going well aboard Apollo 11 maintaining a stable Passive Thermal Control mode, nose pointed toward the Earth, rotating 3 revolutions per hour. This is Mission Control, Houston.
168:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 168 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 121,505 nautical miles, velocity 5138 feet per second. All systems are performing well. The crew is still asleep. Clock here in the Control Center shows 26 hours, 34 minutes, 37 seconds until entry into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.
169:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 169 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 118,542 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 5225 feet per second. The crew is still asleep, the performance of all systems continues to be normal. Mid-course correction number 6, which was scheduled for an elapsed time of 172 hours, has been canceled. The trajectory is such that it will not be required. From the Manned Space Flight Network we have a contribution to the Apollo 11 mission from a 10 year old boy in Guam. The Guam tracking station is receiving telemetry from this mission and had a problem with one if its antennas - a bearing. The bearing was replaced with the assistance of a 10 year old boy named Greg Force who had an arm small enough that he could work through a 2 and a half inch diameter hole to pack the new bearing. We're now showing entry interface with the Earth's atmosphere 25 hours 33 minutes 30 seconds from now, and the Green Team of Flight Controllers, led by Cliff Charlesworth, is now taking over from Glynn Lunney and his Black Team of Flight Controllers. This is Mission Control Houston.
170:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours 28 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that all three crew members probably are still sleeping. And there are no immediate plans to awaken them at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 115,470 nautical miles from the Earth and the speed is up to 5,317 feet per second. In about 4 hours 174 hours 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, Apollo 11 will be in terms of distance half way home. At that point it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Moon, and 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth. All systems on the spacecraft continue to function normally at this time. The spacecraft weight is almost an even 26,000 pounds. At 170 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
170:54:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours and 54 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reported a few minutes ago that telemetry data now indicates all three crewmen are awake after about 10 hours of rest. We expect we will be hearing from them shortly. Apollo 11 at this time is 114,146 nautical miles from here and the spacecraft velocity is 5359 feet per second. A press conference with the principal investigators for lunar samples is scheduled to begin in about 4 or 5 minutes and during that press conference we will tape record any conversation with the crew and play them back following. And 170 hours, 55 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
170:59:56|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Are you up and at them yet? Qver.
171:00:04|T|CDR|Well, we're up, at least, Owen.
171:00:09|T|CMP|Eyeballing my Magellanic clouds. Over.
171:00:12|T|CC|11, Houston. Got your signals loud and clear, here. How are things this morning? Over.
171:00:24|T|CDR|Do you read us, Owen?
171:00:27|T|CC|Roger. Loud and clear, 11.
171:00:31|T|CDR|Okay. Everything ... to be all right here. So far, we haven't been looking in the cockpit yet. We've been spending our time looking outside the cockpit. ...
171:00:42|T|CC|Roger, 11. You're breaking up just a little bit there, Neil. Your signals are loud but are breaking up occasionally. Your spacecraft all looks good here from the ground. We noticed you stirring around the cockpit and thought we'd give you a call. Over.
171:00:59|T|CDR|Good morning.
171:01:07|T|CC|11, Houston. We do have a few items for you here, entry PAD's, consumables, and so forth. After you've had a chance to get organized, whenever you're ready to start on a few of these items, why, we'll read them up to you. Over.
171:01:22|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
171:01:50|T|LMP|Go ahead, Owen. I've got the book now. I'm ready to copy.
171:01:52|T|CC|Okay, Buzz. On your Flight Plan items, a few updates first of all. We've cancelled mid-course number 6. Just remain - remain in PTC. I'll give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the Flight Plan is we're ready for a BATT B charge anytime you want to put it on the line; and third item, we'd like a wastewater dump a little differently this time. We'd like to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes. And on our mark, we would like to have a wastewater dunp down to about 40 percent. I'll give you a more accurate level for the water dump a little later. Over.
171:02:53|T|LMP|Roger. You must have stayed up all night figuring this one out.
171:03:00|T|CC|11, Houston. Stand by just a moment here until we get out of the NO position on the antenna.
171:04:14|T|CC|11, Houston. We're over on OMNI Delta now. I think we can read you better. Did you get all those first three items on your Flight Plan update? Over.
171:04:25|T|LMP|I got mid-course correction canceled; battery B charge and water dump on your call. Over.
171:04:35|T|CC|That's right, Buzz; and the last item here, we do request that we do a P52, even though we're not doing mid-course correction; and we suggest you get to that after the wastewater dump has been complete. We also have a state vector update for you, if you can give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
171:05:09|T|LMP|Okay. You have the DSKY now.
171:05:12|T|CC|Roger. We'll be sending that up, and I'll give you your consumables update now. It's - for a time of 170 hours, your RCS total is minus 3.5 percent, Alfa is minus 14.5, Bravo plus 7, Charlie minus 4.5, Delta minus 3; hydrogen total is minus 1, and your oxygen total is plus 24. Over.
171:05:50|T|CMP|Roger. Copy those. And onboard readouts, D is 69, C is 73, D is - Let me start over again. Okay. A is 51 and B is 62; C is 63 and D is 59. Over.
171:06:47|T|CC|Roger, 11. Copy those, and we've checked them here on the ground, also. One correction to my last transmission. We would like that P52 prior to the wastewater dump, which is coming up in about 30 minutes from now. Will that be possible? Over.
171:07:04|T|CMP|Oh, yes. We'll take care of that.
171:07:07|T|CC|Roger. And if you're ready for an entry PAD, I'll read that up to you now, also, 11.
171:07:16|T|CMP|Ready to copy.
171:07:19|T|CC|Okay. Entry PAD is area MIDPAC: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 00 28; DL and VL, all four are not applicable; DO, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380; boresight star is Scorpio Theta, up 314, right 34, lift vector up. Comments: Entry data assumes no mid-course maneuvers. Your Earth entry: minus 30 minutes; horizon check, 194 plus 33 plus 03. Your pitch is 297. This assumes an entry REFSMMAT. Your GDC align stars are Deneb and Vega. Roll, pitch, yaw, 078, 233, 340. Read back. Over.
171:09:57|T|CMP|Roger. MIDPAC entry PAD: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 0028, DL and VL NA, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380, Scorpii Delta - Scorpii Theta, up 314, right 34, up. No mid-course correction, horizon, TI minus 30, 194 33 03, pitch 297, Deneb and Vega, 078, 233, 340. Over.
171:11:17|T|CC|11, Houston. That's Roger. Copy. 11, it's also your computer. You can go back to BLOCK.
171:11:28|T|CMP|Roger.
171:18:51|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The crew status report is 8 1/2, 7, and 8.
171:19:00|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger, Neil. 8 1/2, 7, and 8 for your crew status.
171:19:08|T|CDR|Right.
171:19:13|T|CC|11, Houston. Your P52 looks good here on the ground, and we are now estimating that water dump will occur along about 171 plus 40; and we'd like for you to dump to 45 percent. This should let you arrive at Earth interface with just about a full load of wastewater. Over.
171:19:37|T|CDR|Understand 171 40, approximately, 40 percent.
171:22:14|T|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump to about 171 plus 30 just after we reacquire on the next OMNI, and - as I mentioned, it'll be down to 45 percent - is the new quantity. Also, we're standing by for your CM RCS ejector temperature readout. Over.
171:25:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNI's. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.
171:26:00|T|CMP|Okay, Owen. We're standing by for your mark, and stand by for the readout.
171:26:03|T|CC|Roger.
171:26:40|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy injector temperatures? I'll read them in volts.
171:26:46|T|CC|That's affirmative. Go ahead, Mike.
171:26:49|T|CMP|Okay. 2-4 is reading 4.7 volts, 2-5 is reading 4.8 volts, 1-2 is reading 4.8 volts, 1-4 is reading 4.8, 1-6, 4.5, and 2-1 4.8. Over.
171:27:21|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Those - I got them all.
171:29:46|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for you to start your wastewater dump at this time. Over.
171:33:00|T|CMP|Roger. Dumping.
171:33:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We show you - -
171:33:32|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've dumped to 45 percent, and we're stopping now. Do you concur?
171:33:36|T|CC|Roger, 11. We concur.
171:53:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.
171:53:45|T|LMP|Go ahead.
171:53:47|T|CC|11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.
171:55:40|T|CMP|That sounds pretty good ...
172:17:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
172:17:22|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
172:17:24|T|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to try operation with the high-gain array here. If you would select reacquire and your S band antenna to high-gain, your positions are pitch plus 40 and yaw 270, and then monitor for acquisition. Over.
172:17:48|T|CMP|Okay. It's in work.
172:20:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 20 minutes. During the press conference we established contact with the crew. Capsule Communicator Owen Gary had put in a call at 171 hours about 10 minutes after the surgeon reported biomedical data showed all three crewmen awake. Neil Armstrong responded and we have received a status report from the crew and we also passed up the information, preliminary information, that they will use in the reentry tomorrow and gave them a weather report for the prime recovery area in the Pacific, the landing zone. We will play back about 12 minutes of taped conversation that we have accumulated to date and then stand by for any further live comments from the spacecraft.
172:21:25|T|CC|11, Houston. We're just now ready to switch from OMNI Delta over to your high-gain antenna. Can you confirm that you have gone to REACQ? Over.
172:21:35|T|CMP|Confirmed.
172:23:04|T|CC|That looks real good, Mike. Looks like we picked up about 30 dB on the signal strength.
172:23:11|T|CMP|Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.
172:23:22|T|CC|Roger. About 240 and 0.
172:30:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 38 minutes. Apollo 11 now 108,669 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 5534 feet per second.
173:01:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours, 18 minutes. There are virtually no Flight Plan activities scheduled at this time. The spacecraft systems all continue to perform normally, and at the present time, Apollo 11 is 106,482 nautical miles from the Earth, and velocity is 5607 feet per second. At 174 hours, 24 minutes the spacecraft will be approximately half way between the Earth and the Moon in terms of distance, and it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth and the same distance from the Moon. The spacecraft weight at this time is 26,000 pounds.
173:20:00|P|PAO|Owen Garriott is the capsule communicator here in Mission Control at this time.
173:35:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
173:35:28|T|CDR|Go ahead.
173:35:29|T|CC|Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.
173:35:42|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
173:35:44|T|CC|Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.
173:36:14|T|CC|House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.
173:36:42|T|CC|Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Romania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.
173:37:28|T|CC|The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.
173:37:38|T|CDR|Good show.
173:37:39|T|CC|A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.
173:38:29|T|SC|(Laughter) ...
173:38:31|T|CC|Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, as you can tell.
173:38:54|T|CC|And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.
173:39:19|T|CDR|Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.
173:39:23|T|CC|That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can appreciate the rain we're getting right now.
173:39:34|T|LMP|That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.
173:39:39|T|CMP|That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.
173:39:51|T|LMP|Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.
173:39:53|T|CC|Roger.
173:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours 43 minutes. Apollo 11 now 115,165 nautical miles from Earth, the velocity continuing to increase gradually at 5652 feet per second. The cabin temperature in the spacecraft has been running around 62 degrees and coming up within the next hour Apollo 11 will be crossing the midway point in distance, that to occur at 174 hours 24 minutes and 7 seconds. There will be a briefing at 3:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time in the Building 1 Auditorium on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.
173:40:04|T|CMP|Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're doing?
173:40:07|T|CC|Well, I'm not sure about yours. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.
173:47:45|T|CC|11, Houston. Over.
173:47:50|T|LMP|Go ahead.
173:47:51|T|CC|Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.
173:48:08|T|LMP|Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.
173:48:13|T|CC|Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.
173:48:21|T|CMP|Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.
173:48:26|T|CC|Concur on that.
173:48:47|T|CMP|Which is about what we're doing up here.
173:48:52|T|CC|We concur on that, too.
173:49:18|T|CMP|Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.
173:49:27|T|CC|That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.
173:49:50|T|CMP|Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?
173:50:00|T|CC|I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.
173:51:00|P|PAO|That last comment came from Mike Collins referring Al Bean who is the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 12.
173:52:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little Flight Planning for Apollo 12 up here.
173:52:54|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
173:52:57|T|CMP|We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get onboard for Al Bean.
173:53:05|T|CC|I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?
173:53:12|T|CMP|It'll be close.
173:55:52|T|CC|11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.
173:56:11|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. That's in work.
173:59:15|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?
173:59:25|T|CC|Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.
173:59:35|T|CMP|Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.
173:59:43|T|CC|Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.
173:59:50|T|CMP|Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.
173:59:52|T|CC|Roger.
174:00:05|T|CMP|And how'd you like the Command Module RCS temperatures?
174:00:17|T|CC|11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.
174:00:27|T|CMP|We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.
174:00:38|T|CC|We think that's correct.
174:00:50|T|CMP|We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.
174:00:53|T|CC|Roger.
174:01:34|T|CMP|Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.
174:02:07|T|CC|Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.
174:02:16|T|LMP|Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.
174:02:20|T|CMP|I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.
174:02:52|T|CC|Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.
174:02:59|T|CMP|I usually do.
174:03:07|T|CMP|The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.
174:03:37|T|CC|Understand, Mike.
174:05:07|T|CC|11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.
174:05:25|T|CMP|Okay.
174:05:29|T|CDR|Is that a LM off phenomenon?
174:05:59|T|CC|11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.
174:06:12|T|CDR|Okay.
174:06:15|T|CMP|Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.
174:06:23|T|CC|Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.
174:06:31|T|CMP|Okay.
174:11:00|P|PAO|Astronaut Bruce McCandless has just relieved Owen Garriott as Capsule Communicator. At 174 hours 14 minutes Apollo 11 is 103,440 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 5713 feet per second.
174:13:09|T|CC|11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green Capcom at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.
174:13:25|T|CDR|Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.
174:13:35|T|CC|Thank you, sir.
174:13:41|T|LMP|Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.
174:13:45|T|CMP|Great job, you guys.
174:13:50|T|CC|Roger, out.
174:26:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
174:26:34|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
174:26:37|T|CC|11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.
174:27:27|T|CDR|Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.
174:27:45|T|CC|Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.
174:28:04|T|CMP|There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.
174:28:35|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.
174:31:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 35 minutes. Apollo 11 now 102,286 nautical miles from Earth and we have crossed the halfway point in terms of distance at 174 hours and 24 minutes and 7 seconds. The briefing on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory is scheduled to begin at MSC in Building 1. We'll tape record any conversations with the spacecraft and play those back immediately following the press conference. This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 36 minutes.
174:42:07|T|CMP|How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?
174:42:14|T|CC|Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.
174:42:25|T|CMP|Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?
174:42:32|T|CC|No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.
174:42:40|T|CMP|Oh, oh.
174:42:45|T|CC|Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?
174:42:51|T|CMP|He's right. He's absolutely right.
174:44:05|T|CMP|How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?
174:44:15|T|CC|Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.
174:44:21|T|CMP|Oh, he must be mellowing.
174:44:23|T|CC|We've only got two of them back here right now.
174:44:30|T|CMP|He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.
174:44:41|T|CC|Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.
174:44:50|T|CMP|Touche.
174:51:08|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the Command Module; and both cameras - or all the 70mm cameras worked just fine.
174:51:26|T|CC|Okay. Very good. Thank you.
175:07:14|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
175:07:19|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
175:07:21|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Do you all have "Change Lima" for your entry operations checklist dated July 23? Over.
175:07:34|T|LMP|Dated when?
175:07:35|T|CC|July 23.
175:07:38|T|LMP|I'm not sure that we hung around long enough to pick that one up.
175:07:44|T|CC|Okay. If you've got the entry operations checklist handy, then I'll pass it up to you. Over.
175:07:53|T|LMP|How can you make changes after lift off?
175:08:04|T|LMP|You sure you don't mean June?
175:08:06|T|CC|Negative. It just came up today. Over.
175:08:12|T|LMP|So, you're the first to get to us. Go ahead.
175:08:18|T|CC|Okay. On page 6-1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and wastewater tanks during descent. Over.
175:08:56|T|LMP|Okay. We've got 6-1 out. Go ahead.
175:09:00|T|CC|Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O2 valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN." Do you copy?
175:09:49|T|LMP|Okay. Down at the bottom, after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH; SURGE TANK O2, OFF; and REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, OFF, DIRECT O2, ON" Over.
175:10:04|T|CC|Roger. And then down at the very bottom of page 6-2 where you see "DIRECT O2, OFF VERIFY", delete that step completely. Over.
175:10:20|T|LMP|Roger.
175:10:22|T|CC|And for record purposes, this will be "Change Lima." Over.
175:10:30|T|CMP|Okay. We've got it. How far open do you want this the DIRECT O2 valve to be opened at this point? I guess you want it - just leave it open from that point on?
175:10:46|T|CC|Roger. It should go all the way open, and you can just leave it on from that point on. The intent is to completely depressurize the oxygen manifold. Over.
175:10:59|T|CMP|Roger. Copy.
175:15:34|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information the All Star game has just ended with the National League winning 9 to 3 over American. Over.
175:15:48|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
175:15:52|T|CC|And I have a message here for Mike that says "All the chinch bugs are gone." Over.
175:16:05|T|CMP|Having done their job I guess.
175:16:10|T|CC|Well, along with one tree, it turns out.
175:16:15|T|CMP|Yes. I heard about that. That was right before the flight.
175:16:19|T|CC|Right. That big storm.
175:22:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 176 hours 44 minutes. Apollo 11 now 94,961 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity has just gone over the 6,000 foot per second mark. We're 6,029 feet per second. The next item scheduled on the Flight Plan is a television transmission. That's scheduled to occur at Ground Elapsed Time of 177 hours 30 minutes, which would be 6:02 PM Central Daylight Time. Among the clocks counting down or up to and from significant events here in Mission Control. We have one counting down to entry. That clock now shows 18 hours 18 minutes and 12 seconds until entry. Reentry is scheduled to begin based on no further mid-course corrections at 195 hours 3 minutes 5 seconds. At this time, it appears that mid-course correction 7, if it were done, would only require 0.2 of a foot per second, and based on current tracking, we wouldn't expect to have to mid-course correction 7, although the tracking will be continued and a decision on mid-course correction 7 will not be made - until closer to the time of the maneuver.
175:42:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 175 hours, 42 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 98,512 nautical miles from the Earth. The velocity, 5892 feet per second. During the preceding press conference, we accumulated about 7 minutes of taped conversation which we'll play back for you now.
175:42:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the tape recorded conversation. We'll continue to stand by for any further communications with the spacecraft. During the previous conversations you heard Mike Collins toss a couple of good-natured bobs at Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth. Collins was Capsule Communicator on Charlesworth's shift during the Apollo 8 mission. At 175 hours, 51 minutes Apollo 11 is 98,034 nautical miles from the Earth.
176:23:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you still up there? Over.
176:24:07|T|CDR|Yes, we are. But not quite so far as we were a while ago.
176:24:12|T|CC|Roger. We concur. We just wanted to make sure that we had good COMM with you.
176:24:18|T|CDR|Okay.
176:26:26|T|CC|For general information, 11, you are now 95,970 miles out from the Earth. Over.
176:26:39|T|CDR|Right in our own back yard.
176:26:41|T|CC|Say again.
176:26:46|T|CDR|Right in our own back yard.
176:26:54|T|CC|Roger that.
176:27:03|T|LMP|Trying to come down hill a little bit now. What's our velocity?
176:27:12|T|CC|Your velocity is 5991 feet per second.
176:27:20|T|LMP|Thank you.
176:27:21|T|CC|And you are indeed coming down hill.
177:07:00|P|PAO|And this is Apollo Control at 177 hours 11 minutes. Our network controller advises that we're starting to get some semblance of TV signal from the spacecraft. We suspect that we may be getting some checkout. We'll continue to stand by and be prepared to take whatever's happening.
177:07:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The network controller now reports that the TV signal is down. Apparently having been turned off and we suspect that what we have is a test of the system by the crew. The television transmission from the spacecraft is scheduled to begin at 177 hours 30 minutes or about 2 minutes past 6, Central Daylight Time. At the present time Apollo 11 is 93 thousand 2 hundred 18 nautical miles from the Earth.
177:08:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
177:08:42|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
177:08:45|T|CC|Roger, 11. I've got a Flight Plan update for you to give you an optimum attitude for the Earth in the number 1 window and the Moon in number 5 window. Over.
177:09:00|T|CMP|Ready to copy.
177:09:03|T|CC|Roger. Your attitude will be roll 12 degrees, pitch 270 degrees, yaw 0 degrees. high-gain antenna angles, pitch plus 14, yaw 263. Over.
177:09:25|T|CMP|Roger. I copy. Roll 012, pitch 270, yaw 0. high-gain antenna, pitch plus 14 and yaw 263.
177:09:35|T|CC|Roger. And when coming out of PTC, you might be advised that your deadband has been collapsed, so follow the checklist items. Over.
177:09:46|T|CMP|Roger that.
177:12:23|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're receiving a black signal from you right now, but we are getting TV. Over.
177:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 30 minutes. We're standing by at this time to receive television pictures from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. A short while ago we received the test transmission and apparently everything is functioning normally. We were receiving television signal from Goldstone relayed on through to Houston. We'll continue to stand by for the TV.
177:24:10|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
177:24:14|T|CMP|Go ahead.
177:24:16|T|CC|From signal strength indications, it appears that we may be locked up on a side lobe with a high-gain antenna. We'd like you to go into wide bandwidth for about 15 seconds and then back to narrow. Over.
177:24:29|T|CMP|All right.
177:31:16|T|CDR|You have good S band signal strength now, Houston?
177:31:22|T|CC|That's affirmative, 11.
177:31:29|T|CDR|You all set for TV?
177:31:35|T|CC|Roger. We're all set whenever you're ready to send.
177:31:39|T|CDR|Okay.
177:31:52|T|CC|Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.
177:32:00|P|PAO|We have black and white signals. We should have the conversion up shortly.
177:32:24|T|CDR|Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.
177:33:35|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.
177:33:39|T|CDR|We'll be right back with you.
177:33:40|T|CC|Roger.
177:33:51|T|CC|In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.
177:34:05|T|CDR|We're glad to hear that.
177:34:38|T|CC|Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.
177:34:44|T|CMP|Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the Command Module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our Service Module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factories. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.
177:37:52|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?
177:38:13|T|CC|That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.
177:38:20|T|LMP|Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here onboard our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."
177:41:42|T|CDR|The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built those spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.
177:42:00|P|PAO|That brief view of the Earth came from 91 thousand 3 hundred 71 nautical miles out in space. After a brief and sincere and moving transmission from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 177 hours 45 minutes.
177:43:52|T|CC|11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.
177:44:24|T|CDR|Apollo 11, signing off.
177:47:48|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?
177:47:57|T|CC|You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.
177:48:10|T|CMP|Thank you.
177:53:27|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
177:53:33|T|CDR|Go ahead.
177:53:36|T|CC|Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one Flight Plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.
177:53:49|T|CDR|Go ahead.
177:53:51|T|CC|Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.
177:54:02|T|CDR|Okay.
177:54:03|T|CC|And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.
177:55:22|T|CMP|Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.
177:55:32|T|CC|Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.
177:55:42|T|CDR|Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.
177:56:23|T|CC|This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.
177:56:28|T|CDR|Okay.
177:56:30|T|CC|And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to the nominal. The RETRO's down here are anxious to get an accurate c.g. computed for you, and in particular, where the LEVVA's are being stowed. Over.
177:56:53|T|CDR|Okay. We think we are going to put the LEVVA's and helmets in the hatch bag, and we'll let you know any other nonstandard stowage locations that we complete this evening.
177:57:08|T|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.
178:06:57|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11.
178:07:01|T|CC|Go ahead, 11.
178:07:03|T|CDR|Roger. The magazine we'll be using for entry tomorrow is magazine M. Over.
178:07:10|T|CC|Roger. Understand. Magazine M as in Mike.
178:07:14|T|CDR|That's right.
178:07:19|T|CC|Thank you. Out.
178:17:38|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Your friendly Green Team going off for the night, and going off for the last time. We wish to bid you a good night and Godspeed.
178:17:51|T|CDR|Thank you. We appreciate all that fine work done by the Green Team, and we'll be thanking you in person when we get back.
178:18:00|T|CC|Roger. We'll see you on the ground.
178:18:03|T|LMP|Really enjoyed working with all of you. Thanks very much. Over.
178:18:08|T|CC|Roger.
178:18:09|T|CMP|As usual, all you Greenies.
178:18:11|T|CC|They're all smiles down here, even the trench.
178:22:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in the Mission's Control room of Mission Control Center the white team of Flight Controllers under Flight Director Gene Kranz settling in for the 10 hour shift ahead until 5:00 A.M. Green Team Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth is now enroute to the Houston Apollo News Center and shortly will be there for his change-of-shift Press Conference estimating about 10 minutes for his arrival. We'll continue to monitor the Apollo 11 air to ground circuit should the communications resume. Standing by 178 hours, 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
178:22:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11 now 88,442 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at a velocity of 6299 feet per second. change-of-shift Press Conference with Green Team Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth due to begin any moment now in the NASA Apollo News Center Auditorium. And at 178 hours, 34 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
178:40:30|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
178:40:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
178:40:40|T|CMP|Roger. How's our thruster firing activity? We're about ready to crank up PTC if you are.
178:40:46|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
178:40:49|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
178:56:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
178:56:55|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
178:56:57|T|CC|11, we'd like you to shift to an OMNI antenna configuration at the present time. We're requesting the S band antenna OMNI switch to Bravo and the S band antenna OMNI switch to OMNI. The high-gain antenna track in MANUAL. Pitch minus 50, yaw 270. Over.
178:57:25|T|LMP|Roger. I'll do that right now.
178:57:30|T|CC|Roger. And if Mike has a minute, we'd like to do a little bit of troubleshooting. It seems he's either flat chested or something because we've lost respiration rate on the BIOMED telemetry. That is, the ZPN trace down here is flat.
178:57:56|T|LMP|He was shaving a little bit ago. He might have just let it slip. Hold on a moment.
178:58:06|T|CMP|All the blasted wires are all connected, is all I know.
178:58:11|T|CC|Okay, Mike. We had a request that you disconnect the yellow connector from the signal conditioner and verify that it looks okay, reconnect it and then, if you would, check the two electrodes that are placed one on each side of your lower rib cage. Over.
178:58:36|T|CMP|I bet you there's a smile on Charlesworth's face.
178:58:41|T|CC|Cliff is not on right now. Gene Kranz just relieved him a few minutes ago.
178:58:50|T|CMP|Roger that.
178:59:56|T|CMP|All those wires and things look normal up here.
179:00:00|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We could see variations on our traces. You've connected and disconnected, but the medics still don't have a signal.
179:00:16|T|CC|Looks like you're sending us a message of some sort.
179:00:29|T|CMP|Well, I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.
179:03:23|T|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. Request OMNI Bravo. Request OMNI Bravo. Over.
179:09:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 179 hours, 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. During the past half hour there have been some exchanges between the spacecraft communicator Bruce McCandless here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. One item they're trying to sort out and troubleshoot some difficulties with the biomedical sensors attached to the chest of Command Module Pilot Mike Collins. Let's play back the accumulated tape and hopefully by the time it's ended, we will have picked up communications again and we'll rejoin the conversation live. Roll tape please.
179:10:45|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Communication reestablished.
179:10:51|T|SC|...
179:11:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Will you confirm you're in OMNI Bravo? Over.
179:12:08|T|LMP|Okay. That ought to give it to you.
179:12:12|T|CC|Roger. Out.
179:14:51|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Mike, we're still getting a flat trace on you for the impedance pneumograph. Before you turn in this evening, you might try putting some fresh paste in the sensors, and if that doesn't work, the medics have agreed to forget about it. Over.
179:15:17|T|CDR|Mike's off the loop right now. I'll convey that message.
179:15:20|T|CC|Okay. Thank you.
179:15:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Say again.
179:15:50|T|CC|Roger, Mike. The trace on your respiration rate is still flat. If you have time this evening before turning in, we would suggest that you try putting some fresh paste in the two electrodes that go on the side of your lower rib cage; and if that doesn't work, just give up on it.
179:16:13|T|CMP|...
179:19:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia now 85,198 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching Earth at a velocity of 6443 feet per second. Still standing by for resumption of air to ground communications which may be difficult in as much as Capcom is leaving the room. We'll continue to monitor air to ground as the crew prepares for they're pre-sleep checklists, sets up the Passive Thermal Control mode and sacks out for about a 10-hour rest period in preparation for tomorrow's entry and subsequent recovery in the mid-Pacific aboard the carrier Hornet now hove-to on the aiming point or near the aiming point. Standing by at 179 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
179:44:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia now 82,972 nautical miles out from Earth traveling inbound at 6,546 feet per second. There has been no further communications with the crew of Apollo 11 in the last half hour or so. At this time they should be going through their pre-sleep check list or possibly their evening meal before beginning a 7 hour rest period. We'll take down the circuit at this time and come back when and if the conversation resumes prior to - the time the crew begins their rest period. At 180 hours 03 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
180:07:45|T|SC|(Sound of Train)
180:08:17|T|CC|Hey, 11, this is Houston. You might tell Buzz not to exercise quite so strenuously. Over.
180:08:30|T|LMP|What's the problem?
180:08:32|T|CC|Say again.
180:08:36|T|LMP|What's the problem?
180:08:42|T|CC|Okay. That's one - that's one on us. (Laughter)
180:09:19|T|CC|11, Houston. Seriously, that comment was just aimed at your musical selection.
180:09:26|T|LMP|Okay.
180:09:39|T|SC|(Sound of train)
180:09:59|T|CMP|Come on Neil, not so fast.
180:10:02|T|SC|(Sound of train)
180:10:19|T|CMP|You have an ergometer up here.
180:10:30|T|CC|What was that? Real time exercise?
180:10:35|T|CMP|Just trying to be your ergometer.
180:10:37|T|CC|Roger.
180:21:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
180:21:28|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
180:21:30|T|CC|We'd like to know what your plans are as far as turning in this evening. Our - in the Flight Plan we show you commencing a rest period at about 182 hours, and what are you planning to do on that? We're going to be watching the weather here, and we expect to have an update on the weather, I guess, in about half hour or 45 minutes to pass to you. Over.
180:21:57|T|CDR|We're going to probably stick with the Flight Plan pretty much. We are going to - if - check the lights in the northwest corner of the U.S. and southwest corner of Canada. If we can see up that high into the northern hemisphere. Other than that, we'll be on the Flight Plan.
180:22:21|T|CC|Roger. For your information, the laser from McDonald Observatory in West Texas will be up from about 181 hours and 30 minutes, on for 1 hour. You should be able to spot the Earth out of the number 1 window every time you pass roll 357 degrees and they, of course, are in West Texas. Over.
180:22:47|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
180:23:07|T|CMP|How about the number 5 window?
180:23:16|T|CC|Stand by a minute.
180:23:24|T|CC|Roger. For the number 5 window. That'll be - every time you pass 230 degrees in roll. Over.
180:23:32|T|CMP|Beautiful. Thank you.
180:23:36|T|CMP|You guys are on your toes down there.
180:23:39|T|CC|Roger. - -
180:23:40|T|CDR|You have a new, new star chart. You must have a new, new star chart. Huh?
180:23:45|T|CC|Oh, we got a fresh, fresh FAO here.
180:25:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 180 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We have some 4 minutes accumulated tape in recent transmission between Columbia and the ground. We'll roll these tapes at this time.
180:36:56|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. How much longer do you want us to keep charging battery B?
180:37:17|T|CC|11, this is Houston. Nominally we're looking for about another hour and a half, but what we'd like to do is continue charging until shortly before you turn in for the night. Over.
180:37:30|T|CDR|That'll be fine. Are you going to want to charge A again at all?
180:37:36|T|CC|Negative, 11.
180:37:40|T|CDR|Okay.
180:40:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The weird noise has been reported by network controllers as not being on the down link from the spacecraft. Now it's stopped. Lets leave the circuit open here in the period prior to the time the crew goes to sleep and monitor the air ground circuit.
180:42:18|T|CC|11, this is Houston. At about 180:45, we'll be handing over from Goldstone to Honeysuckle, and I'm handing over to Charlie. See you when you get back. Over.
180:42:32|T|CDR|Okay, Bruce. Good night. Thank you.
180:42:35|T|CC|Roger. Good night.
180:42:36|T|LMP|Thank you very much, Bruce. It's been a pleasure working with you.
180:42:38|T|CC|Have a nice trip down.
181:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've been standing by now for quite some time for resumption of communications but apparently no one is saying anything tonight. Apollo 11 now 78,134 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching at 6785 feet per second. And at 181 hours, 17 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
181:26:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
181:26:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead.
181:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had one brief communication from Apollo 11. Spacecraft Communicator Bruce McCandless is out of the room, the Assistant Flight Director Chuck Lewis went down to the console to talk. Let's play that tape back and rejoin live when the conversation picks up again.
181:27:00|P|PAO|I stand corrected. That's Charlie Duke on the Capcom slot. Bruce McCandless on the last half hour has been relieved. Charlie is likely to respond. Now he's putting on his headset. We'll listen in.
181:27:02|T|CMP|Roger, Houston. For RETRO, I have the anticipated location of all the entry stowage, and I suggest you pull out the entry checklist, and we'll go through those maps in the front of it.
181:27:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you stand by just a few minutes? Charlie and Flight are out getting a weather briefing. They'll be back shortly.
181:27:33|T|CMP|Is this Ken?
181:27:35|T|CC|Say again?
181:27:40|T|CMP|Is this Owen?
181:27:42|T|CC|No, this is Chuck Lewis. Charlie Duke is out with Flight getting a weather briefing right now.
181:27:50|T|CMP|Okay. They're out drinking coffee. I know.
181:27:52|T|CC|(Laughter) They'll be back momentarily.
181:35:55|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
181:36:00|T|CMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Did you get the word on the entry checklist?
181:36:05|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready to talk about it, if you are. Over.
181:36:13|T|CMP|I think the quickest thing is to go through page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me?
181:36:25|T|CC|Roger. With you.
181:36:28|T|CMP|Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown; there is about half the food remaining in L3.
181:36:35|T|CC|Roger.
181:36:36|T|CMP|Where it says - where it says "And note," the CMP PGA is located in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's. The LM shield was jettisoned with the - Correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM, and his helmet and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags.
181:37:06|T|CC|Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's, and your helmet and gloves are in the L shaped bag instead of the sleep restraint.
181:37:21|T|CMP|The helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in.
181:37:30|T|CC|Roger. I thought I - That's what I copied. Okay. Go ahead.
181:37:37|T|CMP|Okay. The next page is identical except a nitpicking point: out R1 we got the entry checklist. Other than that it is identical, and the third page has got some changes.
181:37:49|T|CC|Go ahead.
181:37:50|T|CMP|In A1 - Are you with me? I'm over there in compartment A1, now.
181:37:56|T|CC|Go ahead, Mike. Over.
181:38:04|T|CMP|In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.
181:38:57|T|CC|Copy.
181:39:04|T|CMP|And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?
181:39:07|T|CC|Roger. Go ahead, Mike.
181:39:12|T|CMP|On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.
181:39:42|T|CC|Roger. How about the LEVVA's, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.
181:39:53|T|CMP|They're in the hatch bag.
181:39:56|T|CC|Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.
181:40:16|T|CMP|Okay.
181:41:16|T|CC|11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.
181:42:03|T|CMP|Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.
181:42:06|T|CC|Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton. Over.
181:43:21|T|CMP|Roger.
181:47:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. To recap briefly, the conversation a few moments ago between Charlie Duke and the crew of Columbia. Because of forecast thunderstorms in the prime recovery area in the mid-pacific for tomorrow the Apollo Spacecrafts lifting capabilities will be used to stretch the entry path some 215 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a new landing point, aiming point with the very rough preliminary coordinates of 13 degrees 19 minutes north by 169 degrees 10 minutes west. These numbers will be refined through the night as retrofire officer exercises the computer and comes up with more definitive numbers. These will be passed on as they are available. Apollo 11 now 75 thousand 9 hundred 51 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6 thousand 8 hundred 99 feet per second. At 181 hours 50 minutes and standing by on the air ground circuit this is Apollo Control.
181:51:59|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.
181:52:19|T|CMP|Roger. Infinity.
181:57:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. All good nights having been said, the crew of Apollo 11 is now preparing to get their 10 hours rest and their last night in space. Here in the Control Center one of the 10 by 10 Eidophor television projectors - a drawing has been projected on the screen ribbing Capcom Charlie Duke for his slight error yesterday on the television pass where he mistook the Moon for Earth. It has the spacecraft midway between the Moon and Earth and it says, "Neil, I just spotted a continent on the Moon. Charlie, the camera's on Earth now." Apollo 11 now 74,906 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6954 feet per second. And at 182 hours, 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
181:57:42|T|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're ready to put you to bed and say good night, if you give us your crew status report and verify that you changed out the CO2 canister a moment ago. Over.
181:57:55|T|CDR|Stand by.
182:00:43|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Crew status report follows: CDR 11023, CMP 10025, LMP 09027. Canister change complete.
182:01:01|T|CC|Roger. Thank you very much there.
182:01:02|T|CDR|All men okay.
182:01:03|T|CC|Roger. Thank you. Could you give us an onboard readout, please, sir?
182:01:08|T|CDR|Stand by. Okay. BAT C 37, PYRO BAT A 37, BAT B 37, RCS A 51, B 63, C 62, D 58.
182:01:26|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Thank you much.
182:03:47|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. It's good night from the White Team for the last time. We'll be off when you wake up in the morning. It's been a pleasure working with you guys. It was a beautiful show from all three of you. We appreciate it very much, and we'll see you when you get out of the LRL. Over.
182:04:04|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Thanks to you and all the White Team for a great job down there all the way through. Thank you.
182:04:11|T|CMP|Outstanding.
182:04:13|T|LMP|... very much, Charlie. Thanks.
182:04:16|T|CC|Thanks to you guys, too.
182:04:36|T|CC|And, 11, Houston. Mike, you get your chance at landing tomorrow. No go-arounds.
182:04:44|T|CMP|Roger. You're going to let me land closer to Hawaii, too, aren't you?
182:04:47|T|CC|That's right, sir.
182:07:59|T|CC|11, Houston. We got some word just a moment ago that the McDonald Observatory is - said they had picked up the spacecraft in their telescope. Over.
182:08:09|T|CDR|Outstanding. We have been looking for their laser but haven't had much luck yet.
182:08:16|T|CC|Roger. We'll pass it on to them, Neil. Thank you.
182:10:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 182 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We thought that was all the air-to-ground for tonight prior to the crew going to sleep, but just a few moments ago, there was a brief exchange reporting to Apollo 11 crew that the McDonald Observation or West Texas had the spacecraft in their telescope field of view. Let's roll that tape now and then shut it down again.
183:25:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 183 hours, 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Columbia spacecraft, now - 69,520 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at 7,262 feet per second. Crew now in their rest period. Started their sleep period a little over an hour ago. To reiterate the change in landing point, this is a weather avoidance situation where thunder storms are forecast for the landing point - the original landing point in the Pacific, therefore, after the normal entry interface the lifting characteristics of the Apollo Command Module will be used to extend entry range some 250 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a preliminary aiming point, that is the aiming point may shift around between now and entry which is some 11 hours, 36 minutes from now. But at any rate the aiming point as calculated now is some 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, by 169 degrees 10 minutes west longitude. The preliminary time of drogue decline is 195 hours, 12 minutes. As you were - yes 195 hours, I2 minutes, 4 seconds. And the net extension of - over the earlier splash time is something like 40 seconds. At 183 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
185:29:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 185 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 9 hours 33 minutes until entry. Crew is still asleep at this time, scheduled to wake up at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time, some 3 and one half hours from now. We've had no word from the crew since the scheduled sleep period began. Apollo 11 now 61,034 nautical miles out from the Earth, and velocity of 7815 feet per second. At 185 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
186:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 186 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 8 hours 35 minutes to entry. Crew of Columbia still asleep at this time. Some 2 and a half hours away from wakeup time at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Because of weather avoidance in the prime recovery zone in the mid-Pacific, southwest of Hawaii, it has been decided some time ago to shift the landing point - aiming point - some 215 nautical miles downrange from the pre-mission aiming point. And all the numbers concerned with entry and post-entry events have been generated, and we shall forward them at this time. Pencils ready? Command Module-Service Module separation, 194:48:07 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:20:08 Central Daylight Time; entry interface, that's 400,000 feet above the Earth's surface, Ground Elapsed Time 195:03:07, 11:35:08 Central Daylight Time; begin blackout, 195:03:25 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:35:26 Central Daylight Time; 05G, 195:03:35 GET, 11:35:36 CDT; end of blackout, 195:06:56 GET, 11:38:57 CDT; drogue parachutes deploy, 195:12:04 GET, 11:44:05 CDT; main parachutes deploy, 195:12:52, 11:44:53 CDT; touchdown, 195:17:49 GET, 11:49:50 CDT. Maximum G-1oading to be pulled during the entry phase will be 6.12G's. Entry velocity, that's at entry interface of 400,000 feet, will be 36,194 feet per second. Flight path angle, minus 6.5 degrees. Aiming point location, 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, 169 degrees 09 minutes west longitude. At 186 hours 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
187:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control 187 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 7 hours, 34 minutes to entry. Flight surgeon Ken Beers reports that all three crew members are sleeping soundly at this time. Their sleep period will end probably at 189 hours although they may sleep an additional hour to 190 hours. Spacecraft being tracked now through the Guam station. A line projected out from Earth to what is called a sub-satellite point or a point directly under the spacecraft would put it over dead center of Australia. At 187 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.
188:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 188 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now 46,254 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity continuing to increase, now 9,081 feet per second. There will be a dramatic increase in velocity as the spacecraft gets closer in. Here in Mission Control Center the entry team headed up by Flight Director Milt Windler is beginning to come aboard. Hand over in progress from Gene Kranz white team. The crew is still asleep at this time. They're some 6 hours, 34 minutes from entry interface. And at 188 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
188:43:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 43 minutes. Mid course correction number 7 has been canceled, and we will add one hour of rest time to the Flight Plan. Crew will be awakened at 190 hours elapsed time. To repeat, we have canceled mid-course correction number 7 and we will allow the crew to sleep until 190 hours elapsed time. This is Mission Control Houston.
189:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 189 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 40,961 nautical miles from the Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 9,671 feet per second. Mid course correction number 7 has been canceled and as a result we will let the crew sleep until an elapsed time of 190 hours. Weather in the recovery area. Well we're getting a call from Apollo 11, now. Let's listen to that.
189:28:00|P|PAO|The crew gave us a call at 189 hours, 29 minutes. We advised them of the cancellation of the mid-course correction. Weather in the recovery area - skies will be partly cloudy. Cloud base is at 2,000 feet scattered. Wind, east north east at 18 knots. 6 foot sea. Temperature 80 degrees. This landing area is 215 miles to the northeast from the original landing area, moved because of thunder showers in the original area. This new location should allow the recovery ship USS Hornet to arrive in Hawaii 4 to 5 hours earlier than originally planned. We expect that it may be possible for the carrier to arrive at Pearl Harbor somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock, on July 26, that's Saturday.
189:28:00|P|PAO|The crew is probably preparing breakfast now and it's not likely that we'll hear a lot from them right away, but we'll continue to stay up alive for any conversation.
189:28:00|P|PAO|Visibility in the recovery area is 10 miles.
189:28:00|P|PAO|Clock shows we are 5 1/2 hours away from entry interface the point at which Apollo 11 will enter the Earth's atmosphere. That's scheduled to occur at an elapsed time of 195 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds. We expect landing at 195 hours, 17 minutes, 49 seconds.
189:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11 is now 38,793 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 9,947 feet per second.
189:28:35|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
189:28:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
189:28:43|T|CDR|Roger. Good morning. What's the status on mid-course 7?
189:28:47|T|CC|Roger. We were going to let you sleep in until about 190 hours. Mid-course 7 is not required.
189:28:54|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
189:52:00|P|PAO|- - headed up by Flight Director Milt Windler is beginning to come aboard, handover and progress from Gene Kranz, white team. Crew still asleep at this time. Some 6 hours, 34 minutes from entry interface. And, at 188 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo control.
189:52:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo control at 190 hours, 10 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth, 36,956 nautical miles. Velocity, 10,195 feet per second.
190:19:07|T|CC|Apollo 11. Good morning from Houston. Over.
190:19:12|T|CDR|Good morning, 11.
190:19:15|T|CC|Roger. We saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating your breakfast there. Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190:50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work.
190:19:34|T|CDR|Okay.
190:19:37|T|CC|And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.
190:19:45|T|CDR|Glad to hear it.
190:19:48|T|CC|Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11:49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.
190:20:25|T|CDR|Hang on a minute.
190:20:30|T|CC|Roger. Standing by.
190:22:28|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.
190:22:36|T|CC|Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.
190:24:51|T|CDR|Thank you very much, Ron.
190:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo. Control at 190 hours, 34 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth 34,622 nautical miles, velocity 10,534 feet per second.
190:31:42|T|CDR|Houston, crew status report: 5.5 7 5.5.
190:31:52|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We copy. And I have your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.
190:32:00|T|CDR|Go ahead.
190:32:01|T|CC|Roger. GET 189 plus 00: RCS total minus 1 percent; Alfa minus 11; Bravo plus 10; Charlie minus 1; Delta minus 1; H2 total minus 0.76 pounds; oxygen total plus 17.6 pounds. Over.
190:32:41|T|CDR|Okay. It doesn't look like we're going to be able to get quite back on the Flight Plan.
190:32:46|T|CC|Not quite; just about though.
190:45:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send your REFSMMAT, state vector, and entry target load. Over.
190:45:23|T|CDR|You have it.
190:45:29|T|CC|Roger. It'll be coming up.
190:47:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 190 hours 56 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth 32,447 nautical miles; velocity 10,876 feet per second.
190:48:04|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Can you tell us where the visor assemblies ended up, there?
190:48:12|T|CDR|We're going to follow your suggestion and stow them under right hand couch.
190:48:17|T|CC|Roger. Mighty fine. Break. The weather forecast in the landing area right now is 2000 scattered, high scattered, 10 miles. The wind about 080 at 18 knots. You'll have about 3- to 6 foot waves. Your Delta H is plus 10 feet. And it looks like you'll be landing about 10 minutes before sunrise. Over.
190:48:49|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
190:48:52|T|CC|Roger.
190:50:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. All three loads are in. The computer is yours. Over.
190:50:38|T|CDR|Roger.
190:50:40|T|CC|And Mike, if you're on loop there, to extend the range and the constant g reentry, here, I've got a little procedure, if you would like to listen to it.
190:50:56|T|CMP|Stand by one.
190:50:57|T|CC|Roger.
190:51:01|T|CMP|I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. Be with you in about 5 minutes.
190:51:04|T|CC|Sure, no problem, standing by.
190:52:24|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Hey, Ron, I wonder if you could give us a good Navy explanation for this Delta H time. Over.
190:52:35|T|CC|Roger. Let me think about it, and I'll come back.
190:52:38|T|LMP|You too, huh?
190:52:41|T|CC|(Laughter) Right.
190:52:48|T|LMP|Collins has got one, but I'm not sure I buy it.
190:58:16|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
190:58:21|T|LMP|Go ahead.
190:58:22|T|CC|Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the ailtimeter reading 10 feet. Over.
190:58:41|T|CMP|All right.
190:58:43|T|LMP|Ah, Collins was wrong.
191:07:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours, 15 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 30,469 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 11,221 feet per second.
191:27:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours 38 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now 27,979 nautical miles, velocity 11,689 feet per second.
191:43:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I have your entry PAD. Over.
191:43:42|T|LMP|Stand by.
191:43:46|T|CC|Roger. Standing by.
191:43:54|T|LMP|Okay, I'm ready to copy.
191:43:57|T|CC|Roger. Entry PAD: area is the mid Pacific, roll 000, 152, 001, GET 194 46 06, 267, latitude plus 1332, minus 16917, 064, 36194, 649, range to go 14045, 36275, 195 03 06, 00 28, DL max 154, 084, 22400, 18000, D0 400, 02 13, 00 17, 03 51, 09 02, sextant star 45 0189, 277, boresight star, none available, lift vector up. Comments: GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223, yaw 340. Additional comments: Use nonexit EMS pattern, EI minus 30, horizon check GET 194 33 06. Pitch 298. You'll get P65, but no P66. Additional note: Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift. Apollo 11, Houston. Read back.
191:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 2 minutes. This will be first time in Apollo that crews have flown lift vector UP during reentry. Normally, lift vector is down. However, we want to extend the range by 215 miles so for a short period about a minute and 25 seconds during the blackout period the spacecraft will be flown with lift vector up. The computer program for that is number 65, up control. Apollo 11 is now 25,301 nautical miles from Earth, velocity has increased to 12,263 feet per second.
191:48:46|T|LMP|Okay, Ron, For MIDPAC: 000, 152, 001, 194, 46 06, 267, plus 1332, minus 16917, 064, 36194, 649, 14045, 36275, 195 03 06, 0028, 154, 084, 2240, 180, 400, 02 13, 00 17, 03 51, 09 02, 45, 0189, 277, none available, lift vector up, GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223, yaw 340. Use nonexit EMS. EI minus 30, horizon check 194 33 06, pitch 298. Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift, and we will get P65 but no P66.
191:50:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. On your GDC align pitch, it should be 233, 233 in the pitch. Over.
191:50:41|T|LMP|Okay. I've got a 233.
191:50:47|T|CC|Also your DL and MAX and MIN, I'm sure. are 22 400 and 18 000. Over.
191:50:56|T|LMP|Yes. That's right.
191:50:58|T|CC|Okay. If you'll dig out your entry checklist there on page E6 1, I'll update your RETRO times there for the various altitudes. Over.
191:51:10|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
191:51:14|T|CC|Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. 0wer.
191:52:06|T|LMP|Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.
191:52:48|T|CC|11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.
191:52:58|T|LMP|I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?
191:53:04|T|CC|That's affirmative.
191:53:06|T|LMP|Okay.
191:58:05|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.
191:58:13|T|CC|Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.
191:59:44|T|CMP|Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.
192:00:07|T|CC|Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.
192:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 30 minutes. Apollo 11 now 22,130 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 13,053 feet per second. We're 2 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds away from entry interface.
192:33:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 48 minutes. Apollo 11 is 19,914 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 13,695 feet per second. We're 2 hours, 14 minutes, 16 seconds away from entry into the atmosphere, the U.S. Air Force C-135 crew will attempt to photograph this re-entry of the Command Module. Aircraft designated A-1ots for airborne light-weight optical tracker system will attempt to record the entry on 70-millimeter still film. Pilot of that aircraft is the ARIA Squadron Commander. Three of his ARIA Aircraft will be in the entry area to provide communications during re-entry of the Command Module. Crew of ALOTS includes the Commander, Colonel Robert W. Hoffman of Wichita Falls, Texas. The pilot who is the ARIA Squadron Commander Colonel Oakley W. Baron of Kankakee, Illinois, Co-Pilot Lt. Col. Wallace L. Emory, San Angelo, Texas. Navigators are Lt. Col. Ervin O. Stewart, Jr., Greensboro, North Carolina, and Major Charles W. Hinton, Mt. Auburn, Illinois. The photographic Specialist Master Sergeant Paul T. Swieczkowski whose home town is not listed. Col. Baron's nickname is the Red Baron who is a veteran of more than 10,000 flying hours, and has flown more than 80 different types of aircraft.
192:33:00|P|PAO|Normally the mission Control Center here in Houston will not attempt to contact Apollo 11 after drogue chute deployment. We will stay off the air and let the recovery forces attempt to establish voice contact. If for some reason, Capcom does want to communicate with the crew, he will request clearance from the recovery forces before putting in a call.
192:53:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 55 minutes. A few of the entry event times have changed from a second to 4 seconds. Others remain the same. Here's the updated times: entry, 195 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds; begin blackout, 195:03:25, 05g 195:03:36; end blackout, 195:07:00; drogue shoot deployment, 195:12:08; main shoot deployment, 195:12:56; landing 195:17:53. Maximum G load expected during the entry, 6.20.
193:01:57|T|CMP|This entry time line is my kind of time line. Nice and slow.
193:02:03|T|CC|Okay, 11. Houston. Roger. It sure is. EECOMM is anxiously awaiting his big moment here for the logic sequence check whenever you're ready.
193:02:14|T|CDR|Okay. We'll be ready for that in just a flash.
193:02:17|T|CC|Roger.
193:02:28|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
193:02:31|T|CMP|Go ahead, Ron.
193:02:32|T|CC|This is Jim, Mike. Backup crew is still standing by. I just want to remind you that the most difficult part of your mission is going to be after recovery.
193:02:42|T|CMP|Well, we're looking forward to all parts of it.
193:02:45|T|CC|Please don't sneeze.
193:02:53|T|CMP|Keep the mice healthy.
193:03:00|P|PAO|And the Apollo 11 backup crew there has joined Capcom Ron Evans at his console, Jim Lovell , Bill Anders and Fred Haise. Also Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations, is at that console.
193:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 193 hours, 10 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 17,158 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 14,633 feet per second.
193:03:03|T|CMP|The Earth is really getting bigger up here and, of course, we see a crescent.
193:03:08|T|CC|Yes.
193:03:12|T|CMP|We've been taking pictures and we have four exposures to go, and we'll take those and then pack the camera.
193:05:18|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're ready for the logic check whenever you are. We're standing by to arm the logic. We've got ELS logic on, ELS AUTO, and all the circuit breakers in.
193:05:30|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You can press on with the SECS logic.
193:05:35|T|CMP|Okay. Logic 1 coming on.
193:05:37|T|CMP|MARK it.
193:05:39|T|CMP|Logic 2 coming on.
193:05:40|T|CMP|MARK it.
193:05:50|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Logic checks good. You're GO for PYRO ARM.
193:05:56|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
193:07:09|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11 has got VHF A Simplex on whenever you want to make a COMM check.
193:07:20|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You faded out a little bit there, Buzz. I understand you have the VHF Simplex A on now. Is that correct? Over.
193:07:29|T|LMP|That affirmative. VHF Simplex A and we're TR on VHF.
193:07:35|T|CC|Roger. Mighty fine. We'll watch it as you are coming on in and let you know when the intelligibility is up. We'll make a voice check with you at that time.
193:07:50|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. I've been holding here in SCS control MINIMUM DEADBAND RATE LOW with the limit cycle on, just as a matter of curiosity, if you guys wanted some fuel numbers from that.
193:08:07|T|CC|11, Houston. Roger. We copy and we've been figuring it out.
193:08:13|T|CDR|Okay.
193:08:18|T|CMP|It's a pleasure to be able to waste gas.
193:08:23|T|CC|Roger. That's affirmative.
193:16:11|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston with a little recovery force information. Over.
193:16:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
193:16:18|T|CC|Roger. The Hornet is on station just far enough off the target point to keep from getting hit. Recovery 1, or the chopper, is there; they're on station. And Hawaii Rescue 1 and 2, the C 130's, are within 40 minutes of your target point. Over.
193:16:50|T|CMP|Sounds good. Thank you.
193:18:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 193 hours 20 minutes. Apollo 11 is 15,854 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 15,154 feet per second. We're just - we're 1 hour 43 minutes away from entry and here are the altitudes at which the entry events are expected to occur. Entry at 75 statute miles, beginning blackout at 62 statute miles, 05 g 57 statute miles, end blackout 41 statute miles, drogue chute deployment 23,300 feet, and main chute deployment 10,500 feet
193:25:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
193:25:11|T|CDR|Go ahead.
193:25:13|T|CC|Roger. Just to get a little downlink here to check out our VHF: I show us about an hour and 37 minutes, approximately, from entry interface. Over.
193:25:26|T|LMP|Okay. That's about right.
193:25:28|T|CC|Okay. Looks like we're together on that, and I guess we're standing by for you to whip into the entry attitude.
193:25:37|T|LMP|Okay. We've just been taking a couple of last minute pictures. We've finished the EMS entry check, primary water EVAP activation.
193:25:46|T|CC|Roger. Mighty fine.
193:28:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 193 hours 30 minutes. Apollo 11 now 14,374 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 15,788. We expect entry velocity at 36,194 feet per second.
193:28:00|P|PAO|Capcom that time was Fred Haise, the backup Lunar Module Pilot.
193:28:00|P|PAO|At 193 hours 40 minutes, Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 13,044 nautical miles; velocity 16,439 feet per second.
193:31:22|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
193:31:26|T|CMP|Go ahead.
193:31:28|T|CC|Roger, Mike. We recommend the left VHF antenna for VHF.
193:31:33|T|CC|And this is your friendly backup CMP. Have a good trip, and may - remember to come in BEF.
193:31:42|T|CMP|You better believe. Thank you kindly.
193:31:48|T|CMP|We can see the Moon passing by the window and it looks what I considered to be a correct size.
193:33:26|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Like to switch to S band OMNI C. I just did a minute ago, and noticed a loss of signal strength, over.
193:33:34|T|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead and try it again now that you're in attitude.
193:33:42|T|LMP|Roger. Going OMNI C.
193:37:10|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
193:37:31|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Recommend antenna Bravo. Over.
193:41:08|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Recomend antenna Bravo, or at least a better one. Over.
193:47:35|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
193:47:39|T|CDR|Go ahead, Ron.
193:47:40|T|CC|Roger. Faces are red here. We lost data with you there for a while. Did you do the P52? Over.
193:47:47|T|CDR|That's affirmative, we completed the P52. We'll give you the data from it in just a second. We passed our sextant star check at entry attitude, and right now we're maneuvering to our first horizon cheek pitch attitude of 298 degrees.
193:48:00|P|PAO|Apollo Control at 193 hours, 50 minutes. Apollo 11's distance now 11,463 nautical miles approaching at a velocity of 17,322 feet per second. We're just under an hour away from scheduled Command Module-Service Module separation and about an hour and 12 minutes away from entry.
193:48:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 194 hours. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now 10,066 nautical miles. Velocity 18,227 feet per second.
193:48:00|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins.
193:48:00|P|PAO|Apollo 11 is 1 hour away now from entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
193:48:05|T|CC|Roger. Copy that, 11.
193:58:53|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. About 4 minutes to 1 hour, and I'll give you a mark at 1 hour. Was a Command Module preheat necessary? Over.
193:59:03|T|CMP|Negative that.
193:59:06|T|CC|Roger. Copy. Negative Command Module preheat.
194:02:06|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
194:02:09|T|CMP|Go ahead.
194:02:11|T|CC|Roger. We don't want to jettison the hydrogen tank that stratified, so could you cycle the fans in tank 2 please? Hydrogen tank 2.
194:02:26|T|CMP|You better believe, that old Service Module has taken good care of us. We want to take good care of it.
194:02:30|T|CC|It sure has, hasn't it.
194:02:33|T|CMP|It's been a champ.
194:03:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 194 hours, 10 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 8 5 -
194:03:00|P|PAO|Spacecraft distance is 8,393 nautical miles. Velocity 19,512 feet per second. Rescue and ARIA aircraft are reported on station, and the Hornet's helicopters containing the swimmers are recorded airborne. Swim 1 is helicopter number 53. Three swimmers from that helo are expected to place the collar on the spacecraft, flotation collar. Crew of swim 1 consists of Lieutenant Commander Donald G. Pitchmand, pilot.
194:04:48|T|CC|11, Houston. I'll give you a time hack at 58 minutes to go. It's about 15 seconds yet.
194:04:57|T|CMP|Thank you.
194:05:04|T|CC|Stand by.
194:05:07|T|CC|MARK.
194:05:08|T|CC|58 minutes.
194:05:13|T|LMP|Roger.
194:10:13|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
194:10:16|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
194:10:17|T|CC|Roger. We have our update at the state vector out there for you. Request P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
194:10:28|T|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
194:10:32|T|CC|Okay. Here it comes.
194:11:55|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.
194:11:58|T|LMP|Go ahead.
194:12:00|T|CC|Roger. The computer is yours now. Looks like you're in VHF range, here. So we'll try a VHF check for you. We'll just send VHF up to you. Stand by.
194:12:11|T|LMP|Okay.
194:12:25|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. VHF check on Simplex Alfa. Over.
194:12:32|T|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, VHF Simplex Alfa, loud and clear. How me? Over.
194:12:38|T|CC|Roger, 11. Houston. You're loud. The standard VHF noise, though, makes you realize that S band is good.
194:12:48|T|LMP|Roger. Understand. Thank you.
194:13:00|P|PAO|Swim One's pilot Commander Richmond is from Orlando, Florida. Copilot Lt. William W. Strawn of Plymouth, Michigan, Crewman James R. Johnson, Raleigh, North Carolina. The swimmers aboard Swim One are Lt JG John McLachlan of Spokane, Washington, PH2 Terry A. Muehlenbach, Chatsworth, California, and ADJ3 Mitchell L. Bucklew, Sanford, Florida. These 3 swimmers are scheduled to attach the flotation collar and then move away from the Command Module while helicopter number 66, designated Recovery One, moves into the area and deploys 1 swimmer, Lt. Clancey Hatelberg.
194:13:00|P|PAO|Lt. Clancey Hatelberg, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, will deploy from Recovery One wearing a biological isolation garment and he will hand to the crew through the hatch their biological isolation garments. At 194 hours 16 minutes Apollo 11 is 7512 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 20,304 feet per second.

194:13:19|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Backup S band now, and we're standing by for Command Module RCS aetivation.
194:13:27|T|LMP|Okay. We're just about there.
194:15:15|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston, you're GO for PYRO ARM.
194:15:19|T|CMP|Thank you, Houston.
194:16:36|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Your Command Module pressurization looks mighty fine to us.
194:16:41|T|LMP|Looks good here, Ron.
194:16:46|T|CC|And 11, Houston, I've got an update for about four items on your entry PAD.
194:16:55|T|LMP|Ready to copy.
194:16:57|T|CC|Roger. Your MAX g, 063; your NOUN 60, your Gamma, at 400K, 648; your range to go on the EMS, 14033; and your RETRO time for V circular, 02 14. Over.
194:17:40|T|LMP|Roger. Copy MAX g 6.3; R2 at NOUN 60, 6.48; range to go, EMS, 14033; RET V circular, 02 14. Over.
194:17:58|T|CC|Roger. Readback is correct there.
194:24:37|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
194:24:39|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. GO.
194:24:43|T|LMP|Roger. The first horizon check 194 23 06 at a pitch angle of 298 does not quite fall on the 31 7 line. It's just a little high. It's within 5 degrees tolerance.
194:24:57|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The horizon check there was supposed to be at 33. Over.
194:25:05|T|LMP|Okay. That's fine, sir. Thank you.
194:25:07|T|CC|Roger.
194:28:00|P|PAO|Apollo 11's distance now 5411 nautical miles; velocity 22,642 feet per second.
194:28:00|P|PAO|Distance 3896 nautical miles; velocity 24,915 feet per second.
194:28:00|P|PAO|And we're about 10 minutes away from the scheduled separation time now.
194:28:00|P|PAO|Apollo 11's distance now is 3000 nautical miles; velocity 26,685 feet per second. In the next 20 minutes Apollo 11 will add almost 10,000 feet per second to that figure.
194:29:00|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Command module RCS looks fine to us.
194:29:05|T|CDR|Same here, Ron. Looks very good. Doesn't make as much noise as we thought. Some of them are barely audible.
194:29:11|T|CC|Roger.
194:29:16|T|CC|And 11, Houston. Weather still holding real fine in the recovery area.
194:29:21|T|CDR|Roger.
194:29:22|T|CC|Looks like it's about 1500 scattered, high scattered. And it's still 3  to 6 foot waves.
194:29:29|T|CDR|Hey, that part of it sounds good.
194:29:33|T|CC|Roger.
194:30:00|T|CC|11, Houston, I'll give you another Mark at 33 minutes. Stand by.
194:30:07|T|CC|MARK.
194:30:10|T|CMP|Roger that.
194:32:37|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you have any recommended settings to catch the sunset. Over.
194:32:48|T|CC|Roger. Well, the time is 36 41. And stand by for some settings.
194:32:59|T|LMP|Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some it at one. So I could be changing settings as it goes through.
194:33:09|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
194:33:19|T|CMP|And the horizon check passes; it's right on the money.
194:33:24|T|CC|Hey, mighty fine. Sounds good.
194:35:07|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. On the shooting at the Sun, f:16th at 1 over 250.
194:35:18|T|LMP|Understand f:16 at 1 over 250.
194:35:22|T|CC|Roger.
194:37:05|T|CMP|And the Sun is going down on schedule. It's getting real dark in here.
194:37:11|T|CC|Apollo 11. Houston. Copy.
194:43:00|P|PAO|Technical difficulties have interrupted the radio-TV news pool feed from the carrier USS HORNET and also the news-writers copy feed from that ship.
194:43:00|P|PAO|Guidance Officer reports the Command Module computer looks good and the guidance and navigation system is GO aboard the spacecraft.
194:43:00|P|PAO|We are awaiting confirmation of separation. We confirm separation now from on the ground readings from telemetry. We confirm separation.
194:43:00|P|PAO|Altitude 1288 nautical miles, velocity 31,232 feet per second.
194:48:54|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see you getting ready for SEP. Everything looks mighty fine down here.
194:48:59|T|CMP|Same here, Ron. Thank you.
194:50:42|T|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine from here. You're cleared for landing.
194:50:47|T|CDR|We appreciate that, Ron. Thank you.
194:50:49|T|CMP|Roger. Gears down and locked.
194:50:52|T|CC|Roger.
194:50:54|T|CMP|Thank you.
194:53:00|P|PAO|Flight Director, Milt Windler, has just informed recovery "We're on the final for the carrier."
194:53:00|P|PAO|800 nautical miles high. Velocity 33,000 feet per second. Guidance reports Apollo 11 right down the middle of the corridor. 7 minutes away from entry.
194:53:00|P|PAO|Velocity 34,630 feet per second.
194:53:00|P|PAO|Velocity coming up on 35,000 feet per second now. 3 minutes to entry. Apollo 11 in the proper attitude and -
194:53:00|P|PAO|Apollo 11 lined up right down the middle of the entry corridor. Velocity's now 35,578 feet per second. We're a minute and 45 seconds from entry. Black out will begin 18 seconds after entry.
194:54:40|T|LMP|Houston, we got the Service Module going by. A little high and a little bit to the right.
194:54:49|T|CC|Roger. Thank you.
194:54:53|T|CMP|And it's rotating just like it should be. Thrusters are firing.
194:55:05|T|CC|Good. It's got a lot of gas there to burn out, too.
194:55:07|T|LMP|It's coming across now from right to left.
194:55:13|T|CC|Houston. Roger.
194:57:07|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You going to turn on the tape recorder shortly?
194:57:19|T|CC|11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.
194:57:24|T|LMP|Okay. I'll have to go to command reset to do that.
194:57:34|T|CC|11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.
194:57:44|T|LMP|I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM, ANTILOG RECORD, FORWARD; high bit rate, and barber pole.
194:58:03|T|CC|11, Houston. We'll send the ON command from down here, see if it works.
194:58:07|T|LMP|Okay.
194:58:56|T|LMP|Got our friend the Moon whipping by the field of view right now.
194:59:01|T|CC|Roger. Copy.
195:00:32|T|CC|11, Houston. We'll have you for about 3 or 4 minutes through Redstone and then pick you up after blackout through ARIA.
195:00:41|T|LMP|Roger.
195:01:00|P|PAO|36,000 feet per second.
195:01:00|P|PAO|We're at entry time. Blackout very shortly. Range to go to splash 1533 nautical miles. There's blackout. This blackout period should last for about 3 minutes 45 seconds. At blackout we were showing velocity 36,237 feet per second. Range to go to splash 1510 nautical miles. The elapse time for end of blackout 195 hours 7 minutes even. Drogue shoot deployment time is 195 hours 12 minutes 8 seconds. And the Control Center will not attempt to communicate with Apollo 11 after drogue deploy time. It will leave the air ways clear for the recovery forces.
195:01:00|P|PAO|ARIA 3 reported a visual contact.
195:01:00|P|PAO|We're at 3 minutes 20 seconds since entry, and the blackout should end about 3 minutes 53 seconds after entry. We're about 11 minutes away from landing. ARIA 3 would - is the up range ARIA aircraft.
195:01:00|P|PAO|The Hornet reports Air-Boss 1 has visual contact.
195:01:00|P|PAO|The Hornet now reports a visual contact. Visual contact from the recovery ship.
195:01:00|P|PAO|Hornet reports momentary visual contact has now disappeared behind clouds.
195:01:48|T|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I'm going to go to COMMAND RESET and turn the tape on.

195:02:00|T|CC|11, Houston. Recommend negative on that. That will put us in low bit rate.
195:02:12|T|LMP|Okay. I already put it to COMMAND RESET, but I still have barber pole on the tape. And now my switch is high bit rate.
195:02:22|T|CC|Okay. That will be fine. On 225, there, if you can reach it, Buzz, the last two circuit breakers in the second row from the bottom, punch those in.
195:02:42|T|CC|And 11, Houston, don't mess around with that 225 there.
195:02:48|T|LMP|Okay.
195:03:01|T|CC|And 11, Houston. You're going over the hill there shortly. You're looking mighty fine to us.

196:13:00|P|PAO|No cigars being lit up here yet. We're waiting until the crew is on the carrier. A few are being wetted in anticipation of a match, but we don't see any lit yet.
196:23:00|P|PAO|The elevator will take recovery 1 down to the hangar deck and where the crew will enter the mobile quarantine facility. And the flags are waving and the cigars are being lit up. And clear across the big board in front is President John F. Kennedy's message to Congress of May, 1961: I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. That has been accomplished.
