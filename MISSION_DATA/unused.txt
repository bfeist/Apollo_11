036:37:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view that we have at the present time appears to be out the window of the Command Module looking at the Lunar Module docking target.
036:37:00|P|PAO|And we seem to have a fairly good view here of the interior of the Command Module. This would look to be the panel, display panel with some of the fuel quantity dials on the right side of the cockpit.
036:37:00|P|PAO|At the time these television pictures were transmitted from the spacecraft, Apollo 11 was about 121 thousand nautical miles from Earth. Where we do have signal lock on we got amazingly good quality on those little omni antennas. As we had mentioned before, normally the high gain antenna would be used for television transmission of this sort.
036:37:00|P|PAO|And we could almost make out a face in that one, and somebody's hand down at the instrument panel.
036:37:00|P|PAO|That last view just before we lost picture lock up appeared to be the right center portion of the main display console, main display panel in the Command Module.
036:47:00|P|PAO|For a brief moment there we had a picture of a somewhat placid Neil Armstrong closing his eyes momentarily. Another crewman to his left, I'm not sure at this point, that I can make out who it was, it did appear it might have been Mike Collins.
036:47:00|P|PAO|That was Mike Collins commenting that he was doing some running in place exercises, and we may get a brief view of that a little later on in this transmission if this picture stabilizes and holds still for us.
037:07:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That concludes the replay of the test transmission from Apollo 11. That transmission occurred about 2 hours prior to the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening. The crew, apparently, testing out the onboard system, and we received about 52 minutes of intermittent television using the spacecraft OMNI directional antennas. And as you could see, as particularly near the end, this is just - appears to be just about the limit television reception from the OMNI antennas. At the time of the transmission, Apollo 11 was about 121,000 nautical miles from Earth. During the replay of that television transmission, we accumulated a very short amount of tape, one or two brief comments from the crew who are in their sleep period at this time. We'll play back that tape conversation for you now.
