|S69-38930|This pre-flight photo shows Buzz's suit in its lunar surface configuration. Note that the sewn-on cuff checklist can be seen on the wrist cover of Buzz's left glove, the one closest to the right suit leg. Note, also, that Buzz is not going to wear a strap-on pocket. See, also, AS11-40-<a href="#5903" target="new">5903</a>. Ken Glover believes that the grey square at the upper right, just below the bubble helmet, is a photographer's grey card; it is certainly not an EMU component. The pattern of Velcro strips and snaps surrounding the connector cluster provided for installation of what seems to have been called an "umbilical cover". There is considerable evidence that the Apollo 11-14 LM crew members' suits all had a similar pattern of Velcro and snaps but, as of June 2007, we have been unable to locate any indication - in photos, checklists, and EMU handbooks - of an umbilical cover having been flown. Karl Dodenhoff has provided a <a href="../EMUconnectcover.jpg" title="image" target="new">photograph</a>, but doesn't remember where he found it. Scan by Eric Jones.

|S69-38889|This pre-flight photo shows Neil's suit in its lunar surface configuration, which includes the Liquid Cooled Garment at the left and the EVA (Extra-vehicular) gloves and moon boots at the right. Mike Gentry at NASA Johnson gives a date for the photo of 9 July 1969, but this may represent the date when the photo was released to the public and that the date it was taken was earlier. Research by Frederic Artner. The suit is shown with a strap-on pocket attached to the left thigh, as was the case during the EVA. In a detail from S69-38889 ( <a href="a11pckt388809.jpg" title="image" target="new">166k</a> ), we see some horizontal strips of Velcro hooks on the outside of the top flap which, on later missions, mated with horizontal strips of Velcro pile on the suit to hold the flap open. In the detail, we see that a loop of Velcro has been added been attached to the flap and a corresponding strip of Velcro has been attached over the front of the left hip. Further details of a typical strap-on pocket can be found in an <a href="../a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">Apollo 16 discussion</a>. The suit shown in that discussion is Charlie Duke's training suit, which had horizontal strips of Velcro pile just above the knee, because Charlie wore his strap-on pockets on his shins. Ulli Lotzmann notes that the card placed between the boots that reads &quot;PGA 076&quot; is wrong. The actual serial number of Neil's PGA is 056. The mistake is undoubtedly due to the fact that the <a href="a11NAA_PGA_LinerAssemblyLabel.jpg" title="image" target="new">serial number of Neil's suit 'liner assembly' is 076</a>. The person who created the card probably saw the serial number of the liner and thought that was the number for the entire PGA as well. Bill Ayrey (ILC) has provided &quot;<a href="Armstrong056ILC_FitCheck.pdf" target="new">the fit-check record</a> from the day that Neil was initially fitted into his 056 suit. It was on December 5, 1968 at 5 PM (which was on a Thursday). Mel Case was the ILC engineer performing the fit check. Neil came back to ILC on Saturday, May 3, 1969 for his final fit-check in the 056 suit.&quot; Journal Contributor Roland Suhr notes that there isn't a mission patch on the suit. Photos <a href="#S6938489" target="new">S69-38489</a> to 38517, taken during an EMU Crew and Cabin Fit-and-Function (CCFF) session on <a href="A11CrewTrainingSummaries.pdf" target="new">25 June 1969</a>, also show the flight suits without mission patches. Clearly, the patches were put on the suits no earlier than 25 June. On 27 January 2014, ILC Historian Bill Ayrey wrote: &quot;ILC was responsible for preparing the suits which included sewing the patches on. NASA was responsible for providing the patches which as I recall, they bought from a company named Lion Brothers. (Bill is correct. See Gene Dorr's patch <a href="http://genedorr.com/patches/Intro.html" target="new">webpage</a>.) Ron Woods was one of our ILC suit technicians at the time and actually suited Buzz up for his Apollo 11 mission. &quot; On 28 January 2014, Ron Woods told Ayrey &quot;We were very late on sewing on the Beta (cloth) Flight Patches. Maybe two weeks prior to launch. And, of course, they were top stitched with the sewing machine and then carefully hand sewn through the top layer of the TMG (Thermal-Micrometeoroid Garment).&quot;
|S69-CDR Gloves|This pre-flight photo shows Neil's EVA (extra-vehicular) gloves. The sewn-on cuff checklist is clearly visible on the wrist cover on the left (upper) glove. Note that there is also a sewn-on decal in the inside of the wrist cover on the right (lower) glove.

|S69-CDR Gloves|This pre-flight photo shows Neil's IV (Intravehicular) gloves, which were worn for suited operations in the spacecraft and lacked the various thermal layers present on the EVA gloves. Lacking the thermal layers, the IV gloves were far more flexible than the EVA gloves.
|Pre-flight X-ray of Neil's Boots|This x-ray was taken on July 7, 1969 by Jack R Weakland who worked in the NASA x-ray lab from 1968 to 1979 and told Ulli Lotzmann in 2002 that " he x-rayed everything from pipe welds to the astronaut moon boots, PGA suits etc. One purpose of this x-ray was to determine and verify that there were no sharp, foreign objects imbedded in the cloth - that is, needle points, pins etc. - that could puncture the pressure suit."

|S64-23846|This group portrait was taken at Philmont Scout Ranch in northeastern New Mexico during a 3-6 June 1964 geology field trip. From left to right, they are: Pete Conrad, Buzz Aldrin, Dick Gordon, Ted Freeman, Charlie Bassett, Walt Cunningham, Neil Armstrong, Donn Eisele, Rusty Schweikhart (behind Eisele), Jim Lovell, Mike Collins (partly hidden behind Lovell), Elliot See, Gene Cernan (behind See), Ed White, Roger Chaffee, Gordon Cooper, C.C. Williams (behind Cooper), Bill Anders, Dave Scott, Al Bean. Journal Contributor Jim Scotti writes "It's a bit sad looking at this image to note that six of the twenty gentlemen in it didn't even live to see the first moon landing; and six of the twenty left footprints on the Moon. They had an equal chance of dying before the first landing or walking on the Moon. Amazingly, we've only lost two of the fourteen who survived until July 1969; and I hope at least a few of them are still around when the next footprints are left on the Moon." Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence adds "One thing I find interesting with photos such as this is who is missing from the photo. Twenty out of the thirty astronauts who had been selected by June 3, 1964 took part in the Philmont Ranch trip. Those missing were, from the first (Mercury) group were Glenn ('retired' a few months earlier), Carpenter (recently returned to the USN), Shepard &amp; Slayton (both grounded), and Grissom &amp; Schirra (assigned to Gemini 3). Also missing, from the second group, were Young and Stafford (also assigned to GT-3) plus McDivitt and Borman (commander and backup commander of GT-4)." Scan by Colin Burgess.

Both have geology hammers stowed in tool belts. Haise also has what looks like a tape recorder attached to the front of his belt. The leather pouch on Lovell's left hip may also hold a tape recorder. The recorders would capture any descriptions they made of the samples which, after the end of the session, could be discussed with the trainers. 24 February 1969. Research by Ed Hengeveld.
|S69-25200|Jim Lovell (left) and Fred Haise appear to be standing on the back gate of a 4-wheel-drive vehicle.

Scan courtesy NASA Johnson.
|S69-25201|Buzz (left) appears to be taking a handheld "before" photograph of a sample, undoubtedly one of the rocks near the head of the <a href="../tools/judy49.jpg" title="image" target="new">tongs</a> Neil has in his right hand. Neil has a tape recorder on his belt and a <a href="../tools/judy40.jpg" title="image" target="new">large box scoop</a> in his left hand. Note that the extension handle attached to the top of the scoop shaft is not symmetric. Note, also, that neither the scoop shaft nor the extension handle shaft have knurled sections for better gripping, as was the case of the flown items. The fact that Buzz is taking a handheld photo may be an indication that the idea of using a bracket on the <a href="../alsj-RCU.html" target="new">RCU</a> had not yet emerged. The camera handle appears to be attached to a lanyard, which also suggests that the RCU camera bracket is still in the future. Buzz has a hammer holder on his belt over his right hip and has a <a href="../tools/judy101.jpg" title="image" target="new">weigh bag</a> hooked to his right, front pocket. Inside the weigh bags, we see the telltale shape of at least one closure tab on an individual sample bag. As can be seen in photo S69-25202, Buzz has a pack of individual sample bags attached to weigh bag. The pack of sample bags is badly out-of-focus but, in S69-25903, an identical pack is clearly visible attached to Jack Swigert's weigh bag. 24 February 1969. Scan courtesy NASA Johnson.
|S69-25202|Buzz (left) takes a handheld documentation photo while Neil appears to be using the tongs to collect a sample. He may be leaning on the scoop for support or may intend to put the sample in it. This photo clearly shows the lanyard attached to the camera handle that Buzz has around his neck.

|S69-31161|Neil has the trigger lanyard. When used, the trigger will release the strap warpped around the middle of the umbrella, allowing it to spring open. 15 or 18 April 1969 Scan courtesy NASA Johnson.
|S69-31162|Neil has pulled the release cord. Note that Neil is holding one of the legs with his left hand, undoubtedly to keep the antenna from jumping and, possibly, tipping over, in reaction to the umbrella springing open. As Pete Conrad told the press during a post-Apollo 12 news conferenced, "I know many of you've seen it deployed in practice. It said on the instructions (that) when you deploy it, it unfolds and springs out. But it (also) said (to) hold on to the leg; and I really didn't hold on to the leg too well; and, when I deployed it, it jumped about 4 feet in the air."

One of the pins, not yet installed, can be seen on the near righthand edge of the camera platform. Scan by Kipp Teague. Paul Coan, Manned Spaceflight Center Television Subsystem Manager who was responsible for the equipment used on the Apollo spacecraft, writes, "The camera was mounted on the MESA upside down because the top plate was the 'hard' part of the structure. It was placed at an angle so that the bottom of the ladder could be viewed when the MESA was fully deployed. (There was some concern about whether the MESA would deploy fully &acirc;&#8364;&#8220; but that was not a problem.) The top was painted with a special white paint to minimize solar absorption and to maximize radiation. In contrast, the bottom was highly reflective to minimize absorption of heat reflected from the lunar surface. The handle/camera interface was designed with two trunnions and two 'hooks' and a latching mechanism so that, as you rotated the handle to its operating position, the handle was latched to the camera. It also provided the suited astronaut the capability of unlatching the camera."
|S69-31574|Locking pin that was seen uninstalled in S69-31573 has been inserted in the proper hole. The lanyard is a safety precaution against loss of the pin . Scan by Kipp Teague.
|S69-31575|Front view of the TV camera as mounted on the MESA. The lens on the camera is the wide-angle lens used to show the ladder. Note that the camera is mounted upside down. Scan by Kipp Teague. Paul Coan writes, "The handle of the TV was 'substantial'. It was designed with a sufficient diameter so that the spacesuit gloved astronaut could easily attach it to the camera, and so that it could carry the weight of the camera. The cable that ran through the handle carried both video and power.".

|S69-32232|Buzz (left) watches Neil use the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC) to move a box between the cabin and the surface. During the mission, Buzz was in the cabin during LEC operations. It seems likely that the 'CDR' sign on the back of Neil's PLSS was added for Mueller's benefit. In a photo of Neil, <a href="#S6931108" target="new">S69-31108</a>, taken a week earlier on 15 April, he does not have a 'CDR' sign on the back of his PLSS. 22 April 1969. Scan courtesy NASA Johnson.

|LLRF Rear View|Photo from behind of the LLRF vehicle approaching touchdown. Note that the 'craters' are painted on the flat tarmac. This frame comes from a set of clips provided by Mark Gray on his Apollo 11 DVD set and is used with permission. One clip indicates a date of 28 June 1969. Other clips show either Neil or Buzz walking out to the vehicle. After checking his log book for the time, Neil reported in 2003 "I flew from Patrick AFB (Cape) to Langley AFB in a T-38 on June 30, 1969 and returned on July 1. My log suggests that I was alone." The evidence, therefore, suggests that Neil and Buzz used the LLRF on different days. Late June 1969. Frame capture by Ken Glover.

|69-H-1057|Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins (left to right) in the transfer van returning from the pad with suit tech Joe Schmidt after a Countdown Demonstration Test. Note that, although the astronauts have removed their helmets, they are still using their Portable Oxygen Ventilators to provide air circulation and cooling. Note that the units attached to the suits have white hoses while the unit on the left has black hoses. Perhaps because each unit could only provide oxygen for a limited amount of time, at least two sets of units were used sequentially from the time that the crew started breathing pure oxygen in the suiting room until they were hooked up to spacecraft oxygen. Journal Contributor James Hill calls attention to the fact that, as can be seen in launch-day photo <a href="#69H1121" target="new">69-H-1121</a>, units with white hoses were in use as they boarded the transfer van for the trip to the pad and, as can be seen in launch-day photo <a href="#KSC69PC399" target="new">KSC-69PC-399</a>, by the time they were on the swing arm, they were using black-hose units. In a May 2007 exchange of e-mail, Apollo suit tech Troy Stewart indicated that the black hoses were probably the same as the white hoses except that the outer, thermal insulation had been removed. We do not currently know if there was a thermal reason for using two different units or if the units could provide oxygen for less than the hour that the crews typically used the POVs and the difference in the hoses was a means of keeping track of the units.

Because the F-1 nozzles are underexpanded for that altitude, a very small bit of the escaping burn mass actually goes forward from the lip of the nozzle. Because there are neighbor nozzles doing the same thing there is even more pinging 'upwards.' Couple that with a suction behind the detached part of the supersonic shock wave forming on the side of the S1-C stage and you get that dirty fire creeping up the rocket. It was expected and protected against. You can see the same phenomenon on shuttle launches just before the solids kick off - it looks like the bottom of the External Tank is on fire!" 16 July 1969.

I was stationed at console BE-17 with call sign C2HU. This was the SII LH Propellant Tanking Computer System, the controller that kept the LH level at the correct Flight Mass specified for the mission. It simply monitored the level through a capacitance probe and added LH as the LH evaporated following the filling by the Propellants section and through pressurization, after which there was no boil off. Our section was an Elec section working alongside the Mechs who managed the tank farms and overall propellant handling.

Neil floats in the tunnel connecting the LM And CM, using the TV to document Buzz doing a LM inspection. This photo was, of course, taken by Mike Collins. With regard to the TV camera, Journal Contributor Markus Mehring writes, "What you're seeing here is an extra TV monitor attached to the cam with the ever-present gray tape. Early crews had no such monitor or other means of image control and complained about their inability to easily/properly point the camera inside the cramped quarters of their spacecraft, so this was what they were granted. The camera is the Westinghouse color model, essentially the same model that suffered the burnout on A12, only that this one is IVA-black while the A12 camera was EVA-white. Also note that the camera is actually held upside-down (that is, we're seeing its top side), to capture the CM interior in proper alignment for the TV audience."

Hypatia Rille (U.S. Highway Number One) is at upper left, with the crater Moltke just to the right (north) of it. Sidewinder Rille and Diamondback Rille extend from left to right across the center of the picture. Maskelyne and Maskelyne B have a diameter of almost 24 and 9 km respectively, and the distance from the crater center of Maskelyne to the Apollo 11 landing site is about 210 km. While Moltke is a relatively small crater, with a diameter of merely 6.5 km, its very light ejecta blanket makes it easy to find for Earth-based observers with moderately sized telescopes, making it a popular landmark for locating Station Tranquillitatis. Research by Danny Caes. Compare with a Starry Night view ( <a href="A11-03d22h50m.jpg" title="image" target="new">0.2Mb</a> ) of the area at the same time 5437 was taken. When I wrote a version of this caption sometime between 2 October 2008 and 27 April 2009, I thought this image was taken at about 94:50:00, when Buzz told Houston, &quot:Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out most all of the features we've identified previously.&quot:. I didn't start using JPL Horizons until September 2009 and, until July 2012, hadn't checked the solar elevation at Tranquility Base at 94:50:00. It was 6.6 degrees, much too high to have put the terminator in its 5437 location. During my re-evaluation of this sequence of photos, I looked through the on-board transcripts recently added to the <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/13day4-eagle-checkout.htm" target="new">Apollo 11 Flight Journal</a> for Day 4, including time Neil and Buzz spent in Eagle. At 82:56:25, Buzz tells Neil and Mike, &quot;I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.&quot; At this time, the solar elevation at Tranquility is only 0.6 degrees, which would put the terminator about 0.6 degrees of longitude west of the landing site. In the <a href="A11LBL5437.jpg" title="image" target="new">labeled version of 5437</a>we see that the terminator is at about the location of Crater Sabine C which is, indeed, 0.6 degrees west of Tranquility Base.

Markus recommends <a href="AS11-37-5438rot60right.jpg" title="image" target="new">rotating the image about 60 degrees right</a> to put north at the top for comparison with such maps as Plate 35 in R&uuml;kl's <i>Atlas of the Moon</i>.

In two minutes, they moved westward by about 6 degrees of longitude.

The first of the two photos was taken at about 21hr 32m on 20 July 1969 UTC/GMT; and the second at about 5hr 43m on 21 July. The solar elevations were 10.9 and 15.1 degrees at the two times, respectively. The LM, from the bottom of the footpads the the top edge of the rendezvous radar, is 7.04 meters tall, so the shadow lengths on level ground would have been 37 meters and 26 meters at the two times, respectively.

The first of the two photos was taken at about 21hr 32m on 20 July 1969 UTC/GMT; and the second at about 5hr 43m on 21 July. The solar elevations were 10.9 and 15.1 degrees at the two times, respectively. The LM, from the bottom of the footpads the the top edge of the rendezvous radar, is 7.04 meters tall, so the shadow lengths on level ground would have been 37 meters and 26 meters at the two times, respectively. For reference, the western member of the crater doublet has a diameter of about 12 meters. Animated GIF by Yuri Krasilnikov.

109:36:07|AS11-37-5505|The black shadow of the LM is silhouetted against the Moon's surface in this photograph taken out Neil's window. Impressions in the lunar soil made by the lunar boots of the two astronauts are clearly visible. Journal Contributor AwE130 has provided an <a href="a11det5505AwE130.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced detail</a> which shows the Contingency Sample Collector (CSC) ring, which had been previously identified in EVA photo AS11-40-<a href="#5864" target="new">5864</a> by the Eric Jones. In the 5505 detail, we see a light-colored "&quot;stem&quot; on the outside of the ring which, as is suggested by the comparison with pre-flight photo <a href="../tools/tools09.jpg" title="image" target="new">S68-54939</a>, fit in the Sampler handle to secure the ring in place. Journal Contributor Karl Dodenhoff has provided a photo of a CSC on display at the Kennedy Space Center. The base of the stem is marked. See also, procedures for <a href="a11flspCSC_Procedures.jpg" title="image" target="new">CSC use</a> from the Apollo 11 Final Lunar Surface Procedures <a href="a11flsp.pdf" target="new">volume</a>, in which we learn that the &quot;ring&quot; was part of the &quot;lip/bag assembly&quot;. AwE130 notes that the ring can also be seen in post-EVA photos AS11-39-<a href="#5798" target="new">5798-5800</a> and in EVA photo AS11-40-<a href="#5871" target="new">5871</a>. Note that, because this image was taken out Neil's window, we now realize that that the ring flew a few meters from the spot near the MESA, on the other side of the spacecraft, where we see Neil tossing the ring in 16-mm film shot out Buzz's window.

|AS11-37-5545|The US flag, deployed on the surface of the Moon, dominates this photograph taken from inside the LM. In the far background is the deployed black and white lunar surface television camera which televised the lunar surface extravehicular activity. The footprints are clearly visible around the flag and the camera. The shadow on the right of the flag just below the thruster comes from the SWC staff (solar wind collector).
|AS11-37-5546|Same as AS11-37-5545 with lunar horizon. Slightly stronger exposure settings than with similar shots before.
|AS11-37-5547|Same as AS11-37-5546, a little on the left.
|AS11-37-5548|The camera is once more back at Neil, who documents the surface experiments south of the LM. Two components of the EASEP are seen deployed. In the far background is the Passive Seismic Experiment Package(PSEP); and to the right and closer to the camera is the Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector (LR-3). A LM thruster appears on the foreground
111:00:01|AS11-37-5549|Same as AS11-37-5548. In a <a href="a11lbl5549_alscc.jpg" target="new">labeled detail</a>, Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski has identified a boulder Neil examined at about <a href="a11.clsout.html#1110001" target="new">111:00:01</a> and then left the Gold Camera upright on it while he deployed the LRRR and took documentation photos. See <a href="#5952" target="new">AS11-40-5952</a>, which shows the ALSCC upright on this boulder. Neil grabbed the ASLCC at the start of his run to Little West Crater and took it with him.
|AS11-37-5550|Same as AS11-37-5548.
|AS11-37-5551|Similar to 5548 but aimed a bit lower.

|AS11-39-5822|Left of AS11-39-5821, with the right edge of the LM shadow. By now, several hours after the landing, the sun has risen a bit and the LM shadow has shortened significantly, thus exposing a few rocks at its very top that previously sat in darkness. Note, though, that while the longer shadow is as apparent as the darkened rocks in comparable <a href="images11.html#5771" target="new">photos from before the EVA</a>, the effect is deceiving, since these were taken with different cameras and different lenses. We have a good close-up view on these rocks in the photos Buzz took during his +Z pan (see AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5882" target="new">5882</a> and 5883).

|AS11-40-5846|View of Mare Fecunditatis from Armstrong's window. The two craters close together in the middle distance are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_(crater)" target="new" </a>Messier and Messier A</a>, with light-colored rays extending westward from Messier A, the more distant of the two. Apollo 11 photo <a href="AS11-42-6304HR.jpg" title="image" target="new">AS11-42-6304</a> shows the pair from overhead. Taruntius P is partially hidden behind the RCS thruster. Taruntius K is the slightly smaller crater further north. Taruntius H is the prominent crater west of K. These crater look relatively fresh. Taruntius K has a diameter of about 6 kilometers and has a raised rim. Section 4.1.1 in the Lunar Source Book indicates that a fresh crater of this size will have a depth (iincluding the rim) of about 1.2 km. The average inner slope is, then, about 22 degrees. The crater is undoubtedly bowl shaped, so the slope immediately inside the rim is considerably steeper than 22 degrees. During the Rev 4 pass over the foreground craters, the Sun's elevation was about 29 degrees, low enough to have produced a significant shadow inside the eastern rim but not reaching the center of the crater. The only other time prior to the landing when the crew would have had time to take this picture was on the Rev 5 pass. The Sun was a degree higher on that pass, still low enough to produce the inner shadow.

There are some taped instructions on the outside of the hatch. The hose at the right side of Buzz's PLSS which passes under his right arm would deliver emergency oxygen from the Oxygen Purge System (OPS) should he need it. We can also see the OPS actuator cable coming over his right shoulder. We can see some detail on the boot straps. There are <a href="../alsj-PLSSVelcro.html" target="new">horizontal strips of Velcro on the back of the PLSS</a>, which were apparently installed to give the astronauts, while in zero-gravity, a place to anchor their feet on the side bulkhead behind Neil's station. Near the bottom of the back of the PLSS, we can see a sewn-on set of instructions for PLSS recharge operations (not performed on Apollo 11) just above the semi-circular flap. Note that craters and rocks can be seen in the reflection of the lunar surface in Neil's window.

As he said at the moment Neil took this picture, "Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up." The thermal shroud protecting the U.S. flag that Neil and Buzz deploy during the EVA can be seen on the underside of the lefthand ladder rail.

Note the word 'Shade' printed on the bottom of the back side. The word 'Sun' is printed on the sunward side. At the end of the EVA, after leaving the SWC exposed to the Sun for about 1 hour and 17 minutes, Buzz will roll up the foil and pack it in a bag for analysis back on Earth. Note the considerable clearance between the bottom of the Descent Engine bell and the surface beneath it. Little West Crater is near the horizon on the lefthand side of the image. Note the pattern of scratch marks running from the MESA toward the lower left that were created by the TV cable as Neil took the camera away from the LM on the tripod. Neil's footprints are generally to the right of the cable scratches as he moved sideways out from the LM. Several potentially foot-grabbing loops remain in the cable. The rendezvous radar and various antennas on the top of the ascent stage are labeled in a detail ( <a href="a11det5872.jpg" title="image" target="new">223k</a> ). Each of the boot prints is about 33 cm long and has a greatest width of 15 cm.
|AS11-40-5873|Neil took this picture of Buzz at about <a href="a11.step.html#1100324" target="new">110:03:24.</a> Buzz has just deployed the Solar Wind Collector (SWC). Neil took the photo toward the southeast. Buzz is standing flat-footed next to the SWC, facing Neil, who is at about the 2 o'clock position out from the LM. In the lower right corner, notice the scratch marks that the TV cable made as Neil pulled it out. The multiple tracks were made by the individual cable loops scraping along the ground. We can see underneath the engine bell. Most of the surface in this image has not been disturbed as yet, and in the places where Neil and Buzz have walked, the disturbed surface is darker. Good illustration of this very common phenomenon. Jack Schmitt speculates that the Descent Engine plume swept away the smallest particles, leaving a higher than normal percentage of larger particles. The more jagged surface is a better reflector of sunlight than the normal surface and, therefore, appears brighter. Certainly, from orbit, the areas around the landed LM's are brighter than the normal surface. As they walk around, the astronauts disturb this modified surface and, in effect, restore it's normal condition. We see the MESA, in shadow, to the right of Buzz. On the front of Buzz's suit, we have the RCU, the camera bracket, and just above his crotch, the "Red Apple" activator for the purge valve. He has some dirt on his knees. A <a href="a11det5873.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> shows a snap hook fitted to the end of his neckring tiedown.

In <a href="AS11-40-5874.jpg" title="image" target="new">5874</a> Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned his body slightly - and his head a great deal more - to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim. Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case "his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it. But in this case we're lucky." Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created a <a href="as11-40-5874-75.mov" target="new">two-frame movie</a> consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet.

Note the bright 'halo' around the shadow of Buzz's helmet due to some combination of diffraction around the helmet and/or the coincidence of maximum zero-phase backscatter with that part of Buzz's shadow. Markus Mehring notes that the horizon feature beyond Buzz's shadow is a portion of the rim of a cluster of overlapping craters west of the landing site, as indicated in a <a href="a11det5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="new">comparison</a> between details from 5882 and 82a and pre-landing overhead AS11-37-5447.

A question from Journal Contributor Paolo Attivissimo led to a <a href="a11comp5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="new">side-by-side comparison between 5882 and 5882a</a>. By matching features in the overlap region, we see that, when Buzz turned to his right between the frames, he also moved to his right and forward. The fact that the separation of the images of a single rock is farther apart near the horizon than in the foreground is an indication that he moved to his right, and the greater tilt of the lines in the foreground is an indication of his motion forward. Journal Contributor Tom McKeever notes that 5882a includes the shadow of the rendezvous radar antenna, which is also shown in a <a href="../rendradar.jpg" title="image" target="new">LM-9</a> photo by Randy Attwood. Note the large rock just to the right of the LM shadow. A comparison with AS11-39-<a href="images11.html#5822" target="new">5822</a>, a picture Buzz took out his window after the EVA, shows how much the early-morning shadow changes in a few hours.

Neil is facing to the right and slightly toward the camera. Because of that stance and the fact that he has the lower part of his right leg bent back slightly, the right toe is in the deep shadow. Journal Contribributor Robert Hartfield, recalling Kipp Teague's enhancement of Apollo 15 photo AS15-88-<a href="../a15/images15.html#11882" target="new">11882</a> that revealed details of the damage to the descent engine bell during landing, wondered if enhancement of photos of the shadowed area around the Apollo 11 ladder footpad would show any footprints. He suggested Neil's photos 5859, 60, 61, 69 and Buzz's photo 5896. Kipp was unable to bring out any surface details from the suggested Armstrong photos, but had <a href="AS11-40-5896-enhanced.jpg" title="image" target="new">success with 5896</a>, probably because of different camera settings.

Karl Dodenhoff writes that the strap hanging down from behind Buzz's RCU is "the neck ring pull-down strap.

110:42:14|AS11-40-5903|<a href="a11.mobility.html#1104214" target="new">110:42:14</a> Neil has moved to the MESA. Ulli Lotzmann has captured a <a href="a11ArmstrongTakes5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">frame</a> from the 16mm film showing Neil as he takes 5903. No other Apollo photograph has been reproduced as often as this portrait of Buzz. Neil is, of course, visible in reflection on Buzz's visor. Buzz has his left arm raised and is probably reading the checklist sewn on the wrist cover of his glove, which is shown in a <a href="a11det5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a>. He is moving his right foot forward, as can be seen by the mound of dirt building up in front of the toe of that boot. Note the dirt adhering to Buzz's boots and knees. Otherwise, he is remarkably clean. The "Red Apple", which he would grab and pull to open his purge valve in the event of a suit leak or a PLSS failure, is located roughly over his navel. From our perspective, the purge valve is installed in the connector to the left of the "Red Apple". Many readers will note that the scan from original film looks different from the presentation of 5903 that the world has been seeing since the image was released soon after Neil, Mike, and Buzz returned from the Moon. See a history of the image linked <a href="a11-5903history.html" target="new">here</a>. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring has produced a rectified <a href="a11.neil-mirror.jpg" title="image" target="new">close-up</a> of Neil's reflection in Buzz's visor. "I scanned the best and largest print I had available, removed the roughly 5 degree tilt that the original has in relation to the horizon, mirrored it, adjusted color in order to somewhat get rid of the golden tint of the visor, and re-projected it flat in order to kill as much spherical appearance as tolerable - hence the smear on the edges, which is impossible to avoid." In March 2005, Journal Contributor Eric Nelson digitally removed the gold color of Buzz's visor ( <a href="a11nogold5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">321k</a> ) and revealed an unmistakably blue reflection of Earth. Nelson writes, " I eliminated most all of the gold visor tint, leaving a spot that wasn't white and so suggested itself as a film artifact rather than a piece of dust. On scanned slide film, dust would be black anyway, unless it might be some small translucent particle. I get the feeling the AS-11 master film scanning was done with some attention to cleanliness though, which should exclude any foreign objects of that size on the image. It is possible to verify whether any wanted or unwanted tint remains in neutrals in an image by temporarily saturating them heavily; I did that to the Spot toward 100% increase, and it turned Earth-Blue. I similarly saturated the gold-subtracted lunar surface reflections, and the open sunlit surface remained neutral while the surface in the influence of reflection from the LM turned gold: this suggests the gold subtraction was accurate and revealed a valid neutral image. This suggests the gold-subtracted spot did have a blue component...and I hope I don't take too much artistic license in exaggerating it to produce a psycho-visual link!" Kipp Teague writes "I returned to the original June 2004 JSC scan of AS11-40-5903, cropped to Aldrin's visor, flipped and slightly rotated the image and took a stab at adjusting color to offset the gold in the visor. The linked image ( <a href="a11-5903aldrin-view.jpg" title="image" target="new">109k</a> ) represents the original scanning resolution. I don't see a BRIGHT blue object in the sky, but indeed, whatever is there is bluish in color, and more importantly, it is NOT single-pixel scanner noise as I can see elsewhere in the scan. Even better, when you enlarge this, you can see that the object generally matches in shape the Earth as viewed over the LM in AS11-40-<a href="#5924" target="new">5924</a>." In addition to investigations of the intrinsic characteristics of the Spot, it is necessary to verify that geometric factors are all correct. A check of <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons" target="new">JPL Horizons</a> shows that, at 0414 UT on 21 July 1969, Earth was 59.07 degrees above the western Tranquility horizon at an azimuth of 273.11. The Sun was 14.74 degrees above eastern horizon at an azimuth of about 88.84 degrees. The fact that the azimuth difference between the Earth and the Sun was close to 180 degrees, an image of Earth, if any, would be near the line of Buzz's shadow. Further, because the Earth was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, its reflection would appear at a place on the visor where a line perpendicular to the visor surface is 30 degrees (half the Earth's elevation) above horizontal. A labeled detail from AS11-40-5875 ( <a href="a11earth-reflect.jpg" title="image" target="new">74k</a> ) shows that this condition is met near the top of the visor. Sharp-eyed readers will have noticed that the analysis is not yet complete. With Earth slightly north of west and the Sun lightly north of east, the reflected image of Earth should be on the opposite side of the reflected image of Buzz's shadow from the reflected LM. Nelson has produced a rectified detail ( <a href="a11det5903rectifd.jpg" title="image" target="new">192k</a> ) in which "I re-projected the visor image to flatten the horizon (effectively killing barrel distortion), rotated the horizon to level, and then horizontally skewed the image to parallel and square-to-vertical the LM descent stage sides. Finally I mirrored it to produce a normal view to the west. Some distortions remain, which suggests the visor isn't spherical, so that could explain sundry slight geometric inconsistencies in the rough analysis.". The rectified image shows the tentative Earth 'image' tantalizingly close to the line of Buzz's shadow, but on the wrong side. It is tempting to think that consideration of the actual figure of the gold visor will move the 'image' to the other side of the line of Buzz's shadow, but the necessary analysis is yet to be done.

We can see the back of his suit and his legs but, unfortunately, there is no sign of the Gold camera in the image. The Solar Wind Collector is right of center. Journal Contributor Rob South calls attention to the lighter-colored surface in the center foreground. As we know from orbital photos, the area around the LM is scoured by the descent engine and that the scoured area has a higher albedo and, hence a lighter color. Once the astronauts get outside, they knock the soil around with their feet and restore the immediate area to something like its normal brightness. This can be seen quite dramatically in any number of post-EVA taken out the LM windows on A11 and the other missions and even in high-res details from Pan camera frames. When the astronauts work well away from the LM, they are on surfaces undisturbed by the descent engine and the soil they disturb does not have a noticeably different albedo from undisturbed soil. The patch of lighter-colored soil in 5916 has been scoured by Eagle's descent engine but has not yet been disturbed by the crew.

In the lunar gravity field, therefore, each of the four footpads is bearing a weight of about 670 pounds or 300 kilograms. There is a buildup of soil on the south side, indicating that the spacecraft was moving in that direction at touchdown. Otherwise, the footpad did not make much of an impression.

Buzz is preparing to remove the passive seismometer from the lefthand compartment in the SEQ bay. The LRRR is in the righthand compartment. The bay is between the east and south struts and has two doors: a vertically-hinged door at Buzz's left and a horizontally-hinged door which can be seen above the right side of the bay. Buzz pulled on a pulley-mounted tape to raise the latter door. The tape is visible to his right, draped over the support for the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Z</a> (east) strut. Diagrams on <a href="../SEQdoors.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 58</a> of Scott Sullivan's <i>Virtual LM</i> illustrate the way the main door is hinged. Additonal details can be found on pages 38 to 47. To the right of Buzz, and underneath the Descent Stage is a shield to protect the landing radar from the heat of the Descent Engine. Note the object next to the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Z (east) strut</a>. As noted by Journal Contributor Markus Mehring, at the end of Buzz's transmission at <a href="a11.mobility.html#1105220" target="new">110:52:20</a> when he says "gradual sideways hops", we see him working at the SEQ Bay and discarding the object to his right. As noted above, the object ends up next to the minus-Z east strut. Contributor Paul Fjeld writes that the discarded object is ":a small sheet of 5-mil, aluminized Kapton with two little handles that covered the door-deployment tapes."] "There was a similar 5-mil sheet that covered the S-band deployable antenna on Quad 1. The new scans of mag S (from original film in 2004) show the detail of the Quad 1 installation really well. You can see a single handle on the left-bottom part of the quad near the downlock latch shield (little white rectangle) and I can even convince myself that I can make out the little 'fingers' that held the blanket on (with tape to hold them). The astronaut yanked the handle(s) revealing deployment lanyards velcroed inside which pulled out the two 'Antenna Release Pins', the label of which we can now read thanks to Kipp's good work. I re-did the LM-13 blanket at the Cradle Museum after I saw those shots (thanks Kipp!).". </i>

Note, also, how washed out the scene is along the line of his shadow. This effect is due to the fact that, in this direction, all of the shadows - excepting only those cast by objects in the immediate foreground - are hidden by the objects that cast them. The double crater below Neil's LM window is in the middle distance.

As indicated in Figure 3-15 ( <a href="a11psrf3-15.jpg" target="new">280k</a> ), Neil took the minus-Z pan from a location about 20 meters roughly southeast of the LM. The exact location has been added to the inset at the upper right, which shows that Neil was about 55 meters due west of the south rim of Little West Crater. From the <a href="a11GEO-LM.jpg" title="map detail" target="new">site map detail</a> we see that, from the south rim of Little West Crater, the north rim of West Crater is about 460 meters away on an azimuth of about 92.7 degrees. With the help of a little trigonometry, this information gives an azimuth of the north rim of West Crater from Neil's location of 92.4 degrees, with the south rim azimuth being about 112.4 degrees. During the Apollo 11 EVA, the solar azimuth was 88.1 degrees, which allows us to plot the relevant azimuths on a <a href="a11det5936.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail from 5936</a>. The plotted azimuth for the south rim is very close to the lefthand edge of the horizon feature that is obviously a partly shadowed portion of the rim while the plotted north rim azimuth is close to the righthand edge of what is probably a sunlit, rock-strewn portion of the rim.

From 5948, we know that Buzz will put the LRRR down northwest of this boulder and the seismometer southeast of it. This means that at some point after 5944, Buzz will move about 10 meters (30 feet) to his right.

Note the footprints at the lower right. The astronaut who made them seems to have been moving from right to left. The rightmost footprint made with his left boot has a very deep toe imprint while the rightmost imprint made by his right boot is relatively flat and uniform. While bringing his left foot forward for the next step, he seems to have been dragging his heel, a clear indication that he was walking flat-foot, rather then hopping or running. The next left-boot toe print is deep while above it, we see that he was also scuffing his right heel along the surface.

View to the northwest showing the TV camera and the SWC pole. Andrew Vignaux suggests that the fuzzy area at the lower left is part of Neil's suit - probably Neil's left arm - which, because it is so close to the camera, is out of focus.

|AS11-44-6549|View of the Earth from the Command Module Columbia. at AOS. The sequence of images indicate that 6549 has to have been taken before separation from the LM, which happened on Rev 12. Journal Contributor Scott Cruickshank notes that, using Celestia, the position of Australia indicates that 6549 was taken soon after AOS on Rev 6, which occurred at about 04:03 UTC on 20 July 1969. A <a href="a11EarthFromMoon0403UTC690720.jpg" title="image" target="new">Celestia view</a> of Earth from the Moon at that time provides confirmation . As seen from the Moon, the angular diameter of Earth is about 1.9 degrees. Between the times that 6547 and 6549 are taken, the Earth rises about 0.37 diameters or about 0.7 degrees and, with an orbital period of two hours, the interval between 6547 and 6549 can be estimated as 14 seconds. 20 July 1969.

|S69-45002|This is the second rock box Neil filled on the lunar surface. It is the Documented Sample Apollo Lunar Sample Retrun Container and contains approximately 20 grab samples weighing a total of 5.5 kilograms. Neil collected these in about 3 1/2 minutes before starting closeout activities. As he used the tongs to collect a representative sampling of rocks, he put them in a 'weigh bag' made of teflon film. Once he was done, he put the entire weigh bag in the rockbox. In the photo, we see that the weigh bag has been torn open to reveal the rocks. Neil also packed the two core tubes in this box and these can be seen at the upper left. The gloved right hand of the vacuum-chamber operator is at the lower right. 26 July 1969.
