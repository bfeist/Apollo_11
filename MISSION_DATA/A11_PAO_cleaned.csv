-002:40:44|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 40 minutes, 40 seconds and counting. At this time, the prime crew for Apollo 11 has boarded the high-speed elevator from inside the A-level in the mobile launcher, which is the second level inside the launcher. This is a high-speed elevator, 600 feet-per-minute, which will carry them to the 320 foot level, the spacecraft level. Shortly, we'll expect astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to come across swing-arm 9, the Apollo access arm, and proceed to the white room and standby to board the spacecraft. The third member of the crew, astronaut Edwin Aldrin, will be the last one to board the spacecraft, will standby in the elevator seated in a chair, while his two comrades first board the spacecraft. Once Armstrong, who sits in the left-hand seat, and Collins who will sit in the right-hand seat during liftoff are aboard, then Aldrin will be called and he will take his seat--the middle seat in the spacecraft. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong and the Command Module Pilot, Michael Collins now proceeding across the swing-arm into the small white room that attaches at the spacecraft level. In the mean time, about 100 feet below, we have a technician--a team of technicians working on a leaking valve which is a part of the ground support equipment, a part of the system that's used to replenish the fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. He is proceeding to tighten a series of bolts around this valve in the hope that this will correct the leak. Once the technicians do depart, the hydrogen will again be flowed through the system to assure that the leak has been corrected. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, and CMP--the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins now standing by in the white room. T-minus 2 hours 38 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Launch Control.
-002:34:47|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 34 minutes, 44 seconds and counting. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong now aboard the spacecraft at the 320 foot level, at the pad. We had it logged, having the commander going over the sill, into the cabin at 6:54am, Eastern Daylight. Since that time, the commander has now been tied into the system and has checked in over the communication lines. He was wished a good morning by the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, and Armstrong in return said "it looks like a good morning". In the mean time, 120 feet below him, the technicians continuing to work to tighten bolts around a leaking valve associated with the system that replenishes hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage. To repeat once again, this is not a problem with the launch vehicle itself, but on the ground support equipment associated with it. T-minus 2 hours 33 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:30:58|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. Right on the hour, the Command Module Pilot, astronaut Michael Collins, who will be sitting on the right-hand side of the spacecraft during liftoff, boarded the spacecraft. We have it logged at 7:00am, Eastern Daylight Time. The 3rd member of the crew, Buzz Aldrin, standing by in the elevator around the corner along the swing-arm from the white room and the spacecraft at the 320 foot level. 120 feet below, technicians still working on some bolts that surround a leaking value that is associated with a system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. Our countdown proceeding at this time coming up to the 2 minute - 30 second - the 2 hour, and 30 minute mark in the count. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:23:51|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 23 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. The 3rd member of the Apollo 11 prime crew, now aboard the spacecraft. We had it logged at 7:07am Eastern Daylight Time when astronaut Buzz Aldrin boarded the spacecraft. He will sit in the middle seat during liftoff. As Lunar Module Pilot, his normal position would be on the right-hand side. However, due to crew preference we have the Command, of course, Neil Armstrong sitting on the left-hand side, the Lunar Module Pilot for the overall flight, Buzz Aldrin, sitting in the middle seat, and the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, sitting in the right-hand seat at liftoff. Down below at the 200-foot level, are technicians still hard at work at tightening bolts around a valve associated with the system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This is ground support equipment located on the tower at the pad at the 200-foot level. He continues to work at the 200-foot level as the crew in the white room does the same with the three astronauts aboard. We actually have a 4th astronaut still aboard the spacecraft at this time, astronaut Fred Haise who is the backup Command Module Pilot. He is in the lower equipment bay of the spacecraft giving a helping hand to the three prime crewmen as they start to perform some of their preliminary checks here as we head down over the final 2 hours - 2 1/2 hours of the countdown. We're at T-minus 2 hours, 22 minutes, 11 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 2 hours, 21 minute mark in our coutdown, and we are proceeding at this time. At the 320-foot level, all three astronauts now aboard the spacecraft. Just a few minutes ago, astronaut Buzz Aldrin came in and took the center seat to join Neil Armstrong on the left, and Mike Collins on the right. These are the positions they will fly at liftoff. During the process of getting the astronauts checked in to the spacecraft, communication cables must be attached to their suits. They also have to hook into the suit circuit system of the spacecraft that brings oxygen into their suits. They are helped by a fourth astronaut onboard, the backup Command Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Haise, is in the lower equipment bay, and one of the suit technicians who's located behind them, to give a hand as they check in. We've heard from Neil Armstrong and now we've also heard from Mike Collins on comm checks, and we're standing by for further reports as checkout continues. 120 feet down, the work continues on a leaky valve on the 200-foot level. This is ground support equipment - the technicians still hard at work tightening bolts around that valve at this time. 2 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:10:38|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 10 minutes, 35 seconds and counting. At the 320-foot level, the 4th astronaut aboard the spacecraft regretfully leaves at this time. Astronaut, Fred Haise, is about to come out after giving the three prime crewmen a hand in their preliminary checkouts aboard. Haise will be coming out shortly. In the mean time, 120 feet below, where we had that problem with the leaky valve, the technicians have completed their work and they are in the process now of departing from the launch pad. In a short while we'll start flowing hydrogen again, back through the general replenishing system to continue to off up the supply of the hydrogen fuel in the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong, has completed a series of checks called Abort Advisory System checks. This is where certain key crewmen on the ground, members of the launch team, can send signals to the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft - light cues that would indicate difficulty during the flight in which he could take abort action if he determined that such action was necessary. These checks have been completed and Neil Armstrong confirm that the lights came on in the console in front of him - the panel in front of him as these lights were operated from the ground here in the Launch Control Center. All still going well with our count, we will standby as we again, bring hydrogen back to the 3rd stage, we will see how that operates, we're now at 2 hours, 9 minutes, 4 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:07:03|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 7 minutes and counting. At this time, we're just in the process of closing the hatch on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Several of the closeout crew shook hands with the astronauts, and then proceeded to close the hatch on direction from the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin. We had it logged as the hatch being closed and tightened - still being tightened right at this time which is 25 minutes past the hour. Once the hatch is closed, we will start a cabin to condition the cabin inside. The three astronauts, of course, are on pure oxygen in their spacesuits on the suit circuit. We will produce a cabin atmosphere in the spacecraft of a 60/40 combination, 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. This is the atmosphere used for liftoff. Once that is accomplished, the closeout crew will be ready to put the boost protective cover on the hatch and continue with their closeout. The hatch being close at this time, we are proceeding. We'll standby to see how our hydrogen condition is as far as replenishing the hydrogen fuel supply with the 3rd stage to the Saturn V. 2 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002:00:58|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control, we're at T-minus 2 hours, 55 seconds and counting. We're approaching the 2-hour mark in our countdown, and we appear to be proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The crew aboard the spacecraft, the 320-foot level - the hatch is closed and we're beginning to purge the cabin to bring it to the proper atmosphere for launch with is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen. 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen atmosphere. Of course, the astronauts themselves are breathing pure oxygen through their spacesuits. Coming up shortly will be another key test in which both the launch crew for both the launch vehicle crew and the spacecraft team combine together with the command, Neil Armstrong, to make a thorough check of the Emergency Detection System. This is the system that will signal the astronauts in the cabin if anything goes wrong below them. We use the ground-based computer to accomplish this test. As rather lengthy as these tests go using a computer, it will take some 30 minutes. Neil Armstrong will be doing most of the work in the spacecraft, responding as different cue lights signifying different difficulties are presented to him. The abort panel, of course, is across from the commander on the left-hand side, the left front, of the spacecraft. Our countdown continuing, T-minus 1 hour, 59 minutes, 34 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:50:59|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 50 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. We're proceeding with the countdown of the Apollo 11 mission at this time, and it's going satisfactorily. At this point, the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong in the process of working the Emergency Detection System test. This is a test of the Emergency Detection System working with the launch crew here in the firing room, and also the spacecraft team and control rooms back at the Manned Spacecraft Operations building here at the Kennedy Space Center. All going well with these tests at the present time, we're flowing hydrogen back into the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, after having difficulty with that leaking valve. It appears that we are bypassing the use of the valve directly in loading the hydrogen aboard, but we are getting hydrogen back in to replenish the supply. All appears to be going well at this time. Weather is GO. We're coming up on 1 hour and 50 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:40:59|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 1 hour, 40 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactory at this time, as we lead up to what our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, continuing this extensive series of checks of the Emergency Detection System, working with both the launch vehicle test crew, and the spacecraft crew. This is a key test, and a very thorough test to assure ourselves before we commit to liftoff, that all the emergency detection techniques inside the launch vehicle are operating properly here on the ground so if required in flight, the spacecraft commander and, of course, his two fellow astronauts, could be signaled of a difficulty inside the rocket and could take proper abort action as required. Thus far, the three astronauts aboard the spacecraft have just been giving business-like responses back to the directions and checks, working with the spacecraft conductor Skip Chauvin as he runs down his procedures as the countdown continues. We're at T-minus 1 hour, 39 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. This is Launch Control.
-001:30:58|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All elements are GO with the countdown at this time, the countdown aimed at landing two astronauts on the Moon. At this time the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, going through some checks with astronaut Mike Collins aboard the spacecraft. We're winding up this important Emergency Detection System test that Neil Armstrong has been participating in. Meanwhile, at the 320-foot level the closeout crew now placing the boost protective cover over the hatch now that we have completed the cabin purge and have the proper environment inside the cabin. We have also performed leak checks to assure ourselves that the cabin atmosphere is valid. This boost protective cover is used during the early phases of the powered flight and it is jettisoned with the escape tower shortly after second stage ignition. Here in the firing room the launch vehicle test team's still keeping a close eye on the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We're back to 100 percent supply with the liquid hydrogen fuel in the third stage. This problem with the leaking valve is no problem at this time. We've actually bypassed the valve that we are maintaining our hydrogen supply aboard the vehicle. All aspects GO, the weather is very satisfactory for launch this morning, a thin cloud cover about 15,000 feet, temperature at launch time expected to be about 85 degrees. T-minus I hour, 29 minutes, 30 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:20:59|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 20 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All is still GO with the countdown for Apollo 11 at this time. At this point in the countdown Spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, once again, appears to be the busiest worker in the spacecraft as he is performing a series of alignment checks associated with the guidance system in the spacecraft. He is working these checks with the Spacecraft Test Conductor as the test conductor reads out the various procedures and Armstrong responds to them. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft also were informed by the spacecraft conductor a short while ago that the launch vehicle is GO at this time. The hydrogen problem that we did encounter earlier has been solved. "That is real good news", said Armstrong and then he went back to work shortly thereafter. We are now coming up on the 1 hour, 20 minute mark in the countdown. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:11:59|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T-minus one hour, 11 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown for Apollo 11 still going very satisfactorily at this time. In most cases, we're a matter of 5 or 10 minutes ahead of the countdown procedures. The crew in the white room at the 320-foot level who have been aiding the astronauts up to this time are just in the process of finishing up their work. They've been advised by the Spacecraft Test Conductor that they'll probably be able to move out in about 3 minutes or so. Once this is accomplished, once the close-out crew does depart, we'll be ready to move that swing-arm back - swing-arm 9. It will be moved 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch, this is about 5 feet away from the hatch. Once this is accomplished, we will arm the pyrotechnic systems in the spacecraft so in the event of a possible catastrophic condition below them, with the launch vehicle, while still on the pad, the astronauts could fire that escape rocket and separate from the rocket in difficulty. The crew - close-out crew are about to depart at this time. That swing-arm remains about 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch as mentioned - 5 feet or so until the 5-minute mark in the count when it's fully retracted to it's fall-back position. The obvious reason here is in the event we do have to get the astronauts out in a hurry, the swing-arm is in a stand-by position and could be moved rapidly back to the hatch - to the hatch level so the astronauts could depart in the event of an emergency. We're coming up on T-minus 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 20 seconds. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:07:27|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control at 1 hours 7 minutes 25 seconds and counting. Countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. For those people who would like to synchronize their watches in relation to the count, we'll synchronize on 26 minutes past the hour, which is now about 65 seconds away. We'll count down the last 5 seconds to 26 minutes past the hour. We're now 1 minute away from 26 minutes past the hour. In the meantime, we do have information from the Civil Defense Agency in the area. The estimate is more than a million persons are in the immediate area in Brevard County to watch the launch. Now 40 seconds away from 26 minutes past the hour. Civil Defense Agency reports further that there is extensive heavy traffic, a number of traffic jams, particularly in the area of Titusville and the U.S. 1 and Route 50. Countdown still progressing satisfactorily. 15 seconds away from 26 minutes.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 8:26am Eastern Daylight Time. We're now 1 hour 5 minutes 55 seconds and counting, as it was announced at that point. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. T-minus 61 minutes and counting - T-minus 61 minutes on the Apollo 11 countdown, and all elements are GO at this time. Astronaut, Neil Armstrong has just completed a series of checks on that big service propulsion system engine that sits below him in the stack. We want to assure ourselves before liftoff that that engine can respond to commands from inside the spacecraft. As Neil Armstrong moved his rotational hand controller we assured ourselves that the engine did respond by swiveling or gimballing. This of course, is important for maneuvers in space. The countdown is still proceeding very satisfactorily other than two minor problems essentially picked up the count at 11pm Eastern Daylight Time last night, all has gone well. As we approach the one hour mark now, in the count a series of radio frequency and telemetry checks will be in progress with the launch vehicle. We'll also check out the tracking beacons in the instrument unit that travels as a guidance system for the Saturn V during the powered phase of flight. Now 59 minutes, 48 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy launch control.
-000:56:01|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have just passed the 56-minute mark in our countdown. We are still proceeding in an excellent manner at this time. All elements reporting in that all systems continuing to look good at this point. We are still aiming toward our planned liftoff at the start of the lunar window 9:32am Eastern Daylight. A short while ago, in fact the Spacecraft Test Conductor - we are doing quite well, in fact some 15 minutes ahead on some aspects of the preparation spacecraft-wise. Armstrong replied that was fine, "just as long as we don't launch 15 minutes early." Obviously referring to the start of the window. The countdown still going well, T-minus 55 minutes, 10 seconds in counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:50:59|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have passed the 51 minute mark in our countdown. We're now T-minus 50 minutes 51 seconds and counting. Apollo 11 countdown is still GO at this time, all elements reporting ready at this point in the countdown. The spacecraft - correction - the Test Supervisor, Bill Schick has advised all hands here in the Control Center and the spacecraft checkout people that in about 30 seconds that big swing arm that has been attached to the spacecraft up to now will be moved back to a parked position some 5 feet away from the spacecraft. We alert the astronauts because there is a little jolt when the swing arm is moved away. It will remain in that position, some 5 feet away from the spacecraft, until the 5 minute mark in the count when it's completely pulled away to its retracted position. It's coming up now in 5 seconds, the swing arm will come back. Mark. The swing arm now coming back from the spacecraft. Countdown proceeding satisfactorily, we've completed our telemetry checks with the launch vehicle and at this point with the swing arm back we arm the pyrotechnics so that escape tower atop the astronauts, atop their spacecraft, could be used if a catastrophic condition was going to occur under them with the launch vehicle from this point on down in the countdown. We have the high speed elevator located at the 320 foot level in the event the astronauts have to get out in a hurry. This is a special precaution. One of the members of the support team for Apollo 11, Astronaut Bill Pogue, is here in the firing room. He acts as Capsule Communicator during the countdown. His call sign is Stoney. He controls that elevator. He now has it locked at the 320-foot level. These are special precautions for safety purposes during the final phase of the count. Now coming up on the 49-minute in the countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:45:59|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 46-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 45 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. All elements still GO the countdown at this time. The hard work on the spacecraft at this point in the countdown - Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat. He's been working with the Spacecraft Test Conductor on setting up proper switch settings in preparation for pressurizing their Reaction Control System. These are these big thrusters on the side of the Service Module. There's actually 16 of them in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. They are used for maneuvers in space. We pressurize that system before liftoff. That particular operation will be coming up in some 5 minutes or so. In preparation for it, Buzz Aldrin, who has most of the switches in front of him has been preparing for that particular event. The launch vehicle people keeping an eye on the status of the various propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. Just at liftoff, we will have a vehicle weighing close to 6-1/2 million pounds on the launch pad. There's more than a million gallons of propellants aboard the 3 stages of Saturn V. The reports here in the Control Center are the propellants are stable. They did look a little while ago at the RP-1, the high-grade kerosene fuel that's used in the first stage of the Saturn V to make sure it was at it's top level. We keep an eye on these various aspects throughout the count, and use the aid of computers to keep an overall look on general status. So now at T-minus 44 minutes, 21 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:40:58|PAO|This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. We've passed the 41-minute mark in our count. T-minus 40 minutes, 53 seconds and counting. We are continuing, and we're continuing very excellently at this time. There are no problems that have been reported in as the countdown continues to click down. We're still aiming for the start of our window on this, the first flight to land Man on the Moon. Our - we're aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. Coming up shortly will be a key test here in the firing room. As far as the launch vehicle people are concerned, it's a - some final checks of the destruct system aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. In the event during powered flight that the vehicle strayed rather violently off course, the Range Safety Officer could take action to destroy the vehicle. This obviously would occur after the astronauts were separated by their escape tower from the faulty vehicle. We make a check of the destruct system to assure that if the signal is required to get through that, in fact, it will. This is what is coming up here in the Control Center at this time. All aspects of the mission still GO at T-minus 39 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy launch control.
-000:35:53|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 36-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 35 minutes, 48 seconds and counting. We've completed those Range Safety command checks. All still going well with the countdown. A short while ago Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, asked Neil Armstrong if the crew was comfortable up there and Neil reported back. He said it's - "we're very comfortable, it's very nice this morning". For a status report, we'll now switch to Mission Control, Houston.
-000:35:23|PAO|This is Apollo Mission Control. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth's team is on station here in the Mission Operations Control Room, ready to assume the control of this flight at tower clearance. There is a possibility that Apollo 11 will check out the Command Module color TV camera during the first Earth revolution while in contact with the Goldstone station. If this checkout does occur, we acquire Goldstone at 1 hour, 29 minutes elapsed time. We have loss of signal at 1 hour, 33 minutes, 50 seconds elapsed time. This TV camera checkout is a possibility. This is Mission Control, Houston.
-000:30:58|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 31 minute mark in our count. At T-minus 30 minutes 52 seconds and counting, aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 32 minutes past the hour, the start of our launch window on this, the mission to land men on the Moon. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactorily at this time. We've got by an important test with the launch vehicle checking out the various batteries in the 3 stages and instrument unit of the Saturn V. We remain on external power through most of the count to preserve those batteries which must be used during the powered flight. We've just taken a look at them by going internal and then switching back to external again. The batteries all look good. The next time we go internal will be at the 50 second mark with those batteries and they will remain, of course, on internal power during the flight. The Lunar Module, which has been rather inactive during these latter phases of the count also is going on internal power at this time on the 2 batteries on the Ascent Stage and the 4 batteries on the Descent Stage. For the next 20 minutes we'll take a look at some systems in the Lunar Module, then power down at about the 10-minute mark in the count, power down the telemetry to preserve the power of the LM. The Lunar Module on Apollo 11, of course, when it separates from the Command Module in lunar orbit, will have the call sign Eagle. The Command Module call sign, once the 2 vehicles separate, will be Columbia. Both Columbia and Eagle are GO at this time at 29 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:25:59|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 26 minute mark in the count, T-minus 25 minutes 53 seconds and counting, still proceeding very satisfactorily. At this time, Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin working with Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat covering the final pressurization of the Reaction Control System for the spacecraft. These are those big thrusters on the side of the Service Module that are used for maneuvers in space. Each one of these thrusters is capable of 100 pounds of thrust, there are 16 of them located in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. We pressurize the system with helium prior to launch to make sure that all will be in readiness for use in space. The countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. We picked up at the T-minus 9 hour mark at 11:00pm. Eastern Daylight Time last evening. We've just had 2 comparatively minor problems since that time. The major portion of the countdown during the early morning hours, some 5 hours of work was taken, to load the various propellants aboard the stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. As we came into the count this morning we did already have the fuel aboard the first stage, but it was necessary to bring the liquid oxygen aboard all 3 stages and the liquid hydrogen fuel aboard the second and third stages. Close to 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants were loaded during these 5 hours. Following that the astronauts, the prime crew, were awakened at 4:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight as planned in their countdown, and proceeded to have their physical examination in which they were declared flight ready. They sat down for the normal astronaut fare on launch day as far as breakfast is concerned, orange juice, steak, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. The 3 pilots were joined by 2 of their colleagues at breakfast, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and the backup Command Module pilot, Bill Anders who has been named the Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The astronauts departed from their crew quarters - after checking out their suits, they departed from the crew quarters at 6:27am and some 27 minutes later, 8 miles away from the crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center a top the launch pad at complex 39, 6:54am. the commander, astronaut, Neil Armstrong, was the first aboard the spacecraft. He was followed about 5 minutes later by Mike Collins and finally Buzz Aldrin, the man who is sitting in the middle seat during liftoff, was the third astronaut to come aboard. Two minor problems have been encountered during the count - early in the count a malfunction light came on here in the Control Center indicating that we might have a communication problem at the launch pad. Nothing to do with the spacecraft, but it indicated we possibly might not be able to talk to some key technicians we had at the pad. The problem turned out to be very minor, a simple adjustment of some equipment beneath the pad remedied the problem. There was no, in fact, no equipment problem involved. The second problem, we did encounter a leaky valve in part of the equipment that is used to replenish the hydrogen fuel supply on the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. A team of technicians were sent out to the launch pad, at about the time the astronauts were traveling to the pad. They tightened some bolts and we were able to bypass this valve and to proceed with our countdown. The weather is certainly GO. It's a beautiful morning for a launch to the Moon. We expect a temperature of about 85 degrees in the Kennedy Space Center area. The winds about 10 miles - 10 knots, rather from the southeast, and the weather conditions in the round-the-world track, according to reports to the Manned Space Flight Meteorology Group indicate all weather conditions are acceptable for launch. That's our general status. We've Just passed the 22 minute mark in the count. 21 minutes 55 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:16:02|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We are now less than 16 minutes away from the planned liftoff for the Apollo 11 space vehicle. All still going well with the countdown at this time. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft have had a little chance to rest over the last few minutes or so. At least they haven't been busy with procedures with the Spacecraft Test Conductor. In the meantime we have been performing final checks on the tracking beacons and the instrument unit which is used as a guidance system during the powered phase of flight. Once we get down to the 3-minute and 10-second mark in the countdown, we'll go on an automatic sequence. As far as the launch vehicle is concerned all aspects from there on down will be automatic, run by the ground master computer here in the firing room. This will lead up to the 8.9-minute mark in the countdown when the ignition sequence will begin in those five engines of the first stage, the S-IC stage of Saturn V. At the 2-second mark we'll get information and a signal that all engines are running and at the zero mark in the countdown once we get the commit signal, the signal that says that the thrust is proper and acceptable, we then will get a commit and liftoff as the hold-down arms release the vehicle. We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upwards, a vehicle that weighs close to 6-1/2 million pounds. We are now 14 minutes and 30 seconds and counting and this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000:11:00 |PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 11-minute mark. Now T-minus 10 minutes 54 seconds on our countdown for Apollo 11. All still GO at this time. The astronauts in the spacecraft busy again. The Commander, Neil Armstrong, has performed some final switch settings for the Stabilization and Control System of the spacecraft. The spacecraft also now is on full internal power. This came shortly after the 15-minute mark. Spacecraft now on the full power of it's fuel cells. Up to this time, it had been sharing the load with an external power source. Both Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have armed their rotational hand controllers - the controllers they use in flight and we have now gone to automatic system with the Emergency Detection System. That system - it would cue the astronauts if there's trouble down below with the Saturn V rocket during the powered flight. We're now coming up on the 10-minute mark. 10 minutes away from our planned liftoff. MARK. T-minus 10 minutes and counting, T-minus 10.

000:12:31|PAO|We show velocity at insertion 25,568 feet per second.
000:14:56|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on a vector from the instrument unit of the third stage of the Saturn V, here on the ground we're showing an orbit of 102.5 by 99.7 nautical miles. The flight dynamics officer, Dave Reed, wants to get some radar tracking to refine this orbit and he will report a refined orbit after more radar tracking.
000:17:11|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Canary Island Station has acquisition of Apollo 11 now. We'll continue to stand by live for any air-to-ground communication. We're showing an orbital weight of the combined vehicles of 297,914 pounds.
000:21:57|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on that initial orbital figures, the orbital period is 1 hour, 28 minutes, 16 seconds. This number will be refined as - also as we get better information on the orbit through radar tracking. At the present time, we're showing an orbital period of 1 hour, 28 minutes 17 seconds. We'll continue to stand by live through the Canary Station.
000:23:51|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 minutes 52 seconds. Canary Island station has loss of signal from Apollo 11. We have a tape of the air-ground during the launch phase. We'll play that for you now.
000:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 minutes. That's the end of the tape. We have a report on the launch heart rates now from the flight surgeon. Commander Neil Armstrong's heart rate 110, Command Module pilot Mike Collins 99, Lunar Module Pilot 88. These compare with their first Gemini flights, their first liftoff back in the Gemini program. Armstrong's heart rate was 146 at that time, Collins was 125, Aldrin was 110. We have acquisition at Tananarive now. We'll stand by live now through that station.
000:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo - -
000:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The orbital period at that 103 nautical mile circular orbit is 1 hour, 28 minutes, 24 seconds.
000:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 42 minutes, 53 seconds. Tananarive has loss of signal. We'll come back up at 52 minutes into the mission when the Carnarvon- Australian station acquires Apollo 11. This is Mission Control, Houston.
000:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 52 minutes and the station at Carnarvon, Australia is about to acquire Apollo 11. We'll stand by live for this pass.
000:52:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin giving the report and Mike Collins chiming in that at the last with the no cup of coffee report.
000:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal at Carnarvon. However, the station at Honeysuckle in Australia will acquire Apollo 11 in approximately a minute. We'll continue to stand by through the Honeysuckle pass.
000:52:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong in the radio check.
000:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour 6 minutes into the mission of Apollo 11. Honeysuckle has lost signal. Mike Collins reported just prior to LOS here that the crew would check out the TV camera at the Goldstone station. Goldstone will acquire Apollo 11 at 1 hours 29 minutes 2 seconds and will lose the spacecraft at 1 hour 33 minutes 55 seconds. We'll come back up shortly prior to acquisition at Goldstone. This is Mission Control Houston.
001:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour and 28 minutes into the mission. We are about 10 or 12 seconds away from acquisition at Goldstone at which time we expect a checkout of the color TV camera. We will then continue live through the United States pass.
001:28:00|PAO|We have no downlink yet at Goldstone. We're standing by.
001:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The tracking ship, Vanguard, has had loss of signal, however, the Canary Island station will acquire Apollo 11 in less than a minute. We'll continue to stay up live through the Canary station. The ignition time for the translunar injection burn - an elapsed time of 2 hours, 44 minutes, 14 seconds. Duration of the burn expected to be 5 minutes, 47 seconds. We're acquiring at Canaries now. We'll stand by.
001:48:00|PAO|And the temperature on that Reaction Control System quad is coming up to normal now that the heater's on.
001:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour, 55 minutes into the mission. Canary has had loss of signal. We were unable to use the 1 minute of TV time from the mylar station. There is no longer a converter at Mila. The one formerly there has been sent to the Australian station. Tananarive will acquire Apollo 11 on its second orbit of the Earth at 2 hours, 9 minutes, 18 seconds. We expect the translunar injection burn at 2 hours, 44 minutes, 14 seconds. Duration of 5 minutes, 47 seconds and the DELTA-V or the velocity that we will add to the spacecraft of 10,435.6 feet per second. We'll come back up at Tananarive acquisition. This is Mission Control, Houston.
002:08:00|PAO|This Apollo Control at 2 hours, 8 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 about to be acquired at the Tananarive station. As expected this orbit is changing slightly as the S-IVB third stage vents. We are showing an orbit now of 107 by 105.7 nautical miles in an orbital period of 1 hour, 28 minutes, 30 seconds. We have acquired Tananarive now. We'll stand by live through that station.
002:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours, 16 minutes. Tananarive has loss of signal. The Carnarvon station will acquire at 2 hours, 25 and one-half minutes and during the Carnarvon pass the GO/NO GO decision will be made for the translunar injection maneuver. That maneuver to occur at about 27 minutes from now near the - spacecraft is near the Gilbert Islands, about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. We will come back up just prior to Carnarvon acquisition. This is Mission Control, Houston.
002:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours 5 minutes and Carnarvon has acquired Apollo 11. At LOS here at Carnarvon we will have several ARIA's, Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft, in the area between LOS Carnarvon and acquisition at the tracking ship Redstone, so we may have the capability of continuous communications between now and the TLI burn. We'll stand by through Carnarvon.
002:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are 10 minutes away from ignition on translunar injection. We want to add 10,435 feet per second to the spacecraft's velocity, looking for a total velocity at the end of this burn of about 35,575 feet per second.
002:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are 2 minutes from ignition now. We are showing present altitude of about 108 nautical miles. We expect to be in an altitude of 177 nautical miles at cutoff. The present velocity is 25,560 feet per second. We are one minute from ignition.
002:43:00|PAO|and we're one minute from ignition.
002:43:00|PAO|Guidance looking good. velocity 26,000 feet per second
002:43:00|PAO|Coming up on 27,000 feet per second.
002:43:00|PAO|Telemetry and radar tracking both solid. Velocity 27,800 feet per second.
002:43:00|PAO|We're 2 and a half minutes into this burn. Still have another 3 minutes to go.
002:43:00|PAO|And velocity exceeds 29,000 feet per second building up toward 30,000 feet per second.
002:43:00|PAO|Present altitude 115 nautical miles.
002:43:00|PAO|31,200 feet per second now. Altitude 125 nautical miles.
002:43:00|PAO|Velocity 32,000 feet per second. Altitude 130 miles.

002:43:00|PAO|35,000 feet per second.
002:43:00|PAO|Cut out. We're showing velocity 35, 570 feet per second. Altitude 177 nautical miles.
002:53:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong praising the launch vehicle.
002:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, velocity falling off now. Immediately after shutdown we're showing 34,000 feet per second now. The altitude building 512 nautical miles.

003:03:00|PAO|The S-IVB is reported in a stable attitude for the separation.
003:03:00|PAO|Rates are less than 1/10th of a foot per second in all axis.
003:13:00|PAO|One minute to separation.
003:13:00|PAO|We' re waiting confirmation of separation.
003:13:00|PAO|We confirm the separation here on the ground.
003:13:00|PAO|The Goldstone station reports a very weak signal. We believe that (garble) is now maneuvering the spacecraft in the transposition and docking maneuver, and the antenna patterns aren't too good at the moment, so we have a weak signal strength.
003:23:00|PAO|Goldstone still showing weak signal strength.
003:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo ll's velocity now 21,096 feet per second, distance from Earth 6649 nautical miles.
003:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're 34 minutes away from extraction of the Lunar Module from its adapter in the third stage of the saturn. The crew has started pressurizing the LM.
003:33:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins giving the deSC
003:43:00|PAO|At 3 hours, 46 minutes, velocity is 18,917 feet per second. Distance from Earth 9002 nautical miles.
003:53:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong with that report.
003:53:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin reporting that all 12 of the latches in the docking mechanism had locked.
004:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 4 minutes Apollo ll's velocity now is 17,014 feet per second. Its distance from Earth 11,753 nautical miles. We're about 5 minutes away from ejection of the Lunar Module and about 35 minutes away from this evasive maneuver. Ignition time on the evasive maneuver ground elapsed time of 4 hours 40 minutes 1 second. It will be a service propulsion system burn of 3 seconds duration DELTA-V 19.7 feet per second.
004:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours, 34 minutes. Apollo ll's velocity is 14,972 feet per second. Its distance from Earth is 15,895 nautical miles. The spacecraft weight 96,760.9 pounds. We're about 5 minutes away from a evasive maneuver - that one I'm sure there will be no problems of recontact between the spacecraft and the SIVB stage of the launch vehicle.
004:33:00|PAO|The duration of this burn will be 3 seconds. DELTA-V 19.7 feet per second. Ignition, shutdown.
004:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours, 44 minutes. A news conference at Kennedy Space Center is
004:33:00|PAO|about to begin. We will take down the live circuits and tape air-to-ground during this news conference and play it back after the conference. This is Mission Control, Houston.
005:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 11 minutes into the mission. The S4B slingshot maneuver was completed about 5 minutes ago. Designed to put the third stage of the launch vehicle into a trajectory that will take it behind the trailing edge of the Moon and then into a solar orbit. The crew did not witness this maneuver. The command was not in the proper attitude where they could see the S-IVB at the time. We've advised the crew that we do not believe that we'll do the first mid-course correction. That we'll wait for mid-course correction 2 tomorrow and expect a DELTA V to be performed in that maneuver of about 21.3 feet per second. We've also had some other brief transmissions including a - comments from Neil Armstrong on the view out the window, and a weather report on the part of the world he can see. We have the tape of these transmissions that have occurred during the news conference at the Cape. We'll play that for you now and catch up live.
005:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 5 hours 22 minutes. We're back live now. The Delta-P you heard diSC
005:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 31 minutes into the mission. Apollo ll's velocity now is 12,637 feet per second. Distance from Earth 22,971 miles. Spacecraft weight is 96,573 pounds.

005:43:00|PAO|The Cap Com is now Charlie Duke, and Gene Kranz and his white team of flight controllers is preparing to take over the responsibility here in the Control Center from Clif Charlesworth's team.
006:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 16 minutes into the mission. Velocity now 11,479 feet per second. Apollo ll's distance from Earth, 27,938 nautical miles. We're estimating the change of shift news conference for 3:30 p.m. central daylight time.
006:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 31 minutes. At the present time the spacecraft is 29,363 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off gradually, reading now 11,192 feet per second. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has taken over as Flight Director now from Clifford Charlesworth. Kranz has been reviewing the status of the spacecraft's systems with his team of flight controllers; everything looks very good at this point. The crew has been advised that the mid-course correction 1, the first opportunity for mid-course correction, of which has been scheduled into the flight plan at about 13 hours, 30 minutes will not be performed. A correction of mid-course had been scheduled at 11 hours, 45 minutes into the flight plan and that will not be performed according to the tracking data we have at this time. The crew, up until their sleep period which will begin in about 13 hours, 30 minutes or about 7 hours from now will be involved generally in a routine of housekeeping type activities aboard the spacecraft. At the present time they should be involved in some mid-course navigations. At 6 hours, 32 minutes this is Apollo Control of Houston.
006:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 52 minutes. Apollo 11 now 31,565 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 10,789 feet per second. The crew at this time is involved in mid-course navigation using their onboard optical system. We have completed the changeover in briefing of shifts here in Mission Control, and the crew activities, until the sleep period begins, will consist of housekeeping, functions aboard the spacecraft, changing out carbon dioxide filters. They will not be doing the mid-course correction SC
007:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 7 hours, 21 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. During the change of shift briefing, we accumulated about 4 minutes of tape conversation with the spacecraft. That conversation generally related to the onboard batteries, which are currently being charged - a routine operation - and also the mid-course navigation exercise that the crew is currently involved in. We'll play back the tape for you now, and then stand by for any live conversation with the crew.
007:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 8 hours, 8 minutes and Apollo 11 now 38,812 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 9682 feet per second. And we've just put in a call to the crew; we'll stand by for - -
008:11:00|PAO|The PTC REFSMMAT, which capcom, Charlie Duke, just referred to is the passive thermal control attitude that the crew will place the spacecraft in. In this attitude the spacecraft will be rotated at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature balance.
008:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 59 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft altitude is currently reading 42 thousand 7 hundred 53 nautical miles, and we show a velocity of about 91 hundred feet per second. We are in the process now of up linking to the space craft attitude for the passive thermal control mode. Under this mode the spacecraft will be rotated about its X axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperature balance within the spacecraft. The crew has completed the mid-course navigation exercise. They will shortly be aligning the spacecraft stable platform, used as a attitude reference in the guidance system. This is a routine procedure, and following that, the spacecraft will be placed in the passive thermal control mode where normally it would be left during the sleep period. The cabin temperature in the Command Module, has been running between 65 and 70 degrees. The current spacecraft weight is 96 thousand 4 hundred 60 pounds.
009:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 13 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Based on biomedical data, a flight surgeon reports that it appears the crew removed their pressure garments - their pressure suits at about 8:00 PM for. the Commander, Neil Armstrong and Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin apparently got out of his pressure suit about 1 hour earlier or about 7 hours ground elapsed time. The spacecraft is currently 44,529 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity has dropped now to 8983 feet per second. We do have, rather poor lock with the spacecraft antenna at this time accounting for the noise on the air-to-ground circuit. We'll take down the circuit until we reestablish better lock and we'll record any conversations that occur in the interim. At 9 hours, 14 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
009:36:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 36 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission continuing to go smoothly at this point. The communications noise that we were experiencing previously cleared up after the crew was able to get the spacecraft in a good attitude for antenna log-on and we had one brief conversation which we taped and we're presently communicating with the crew at this time. We'll pick up the tape and then continue to follow live conversation.
009:36:00|PAO|That brings us up to date with the taped conversation that we had. We'll continue to stand by for any live communications with the spacecraft. Most of that conversation with Mike Collins involved the platform alignment which the crew is involved in at the present time, aligning the stable platform used by the Guidance System as an attitude reference. Apollo 11 is presently 46,688 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 8750 feet per second.
010:16:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.
010:16:00|PAO|CAPCOM, Charlie Duke, advised the crew that we would be recording the television at Goldstone. We don't have an estimate at this time as to how long it will take to get a play back of that from Goldstone.
010:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours, 51 minutes. That TV transmission lasted about 15 minutes. Goldstone reported that we did get good quality on it. We estimate that it will be somewhere between an hour and a half or two hours before we have the television available here in Houston to play back. The lines will have to be called up between Goldstone and Mission Control Center, and the conversion equipment brought up on line before we'll be able to play back the television from that transmission. At the beginning of the TV transmission, the spacecraft was approximately 50,980 nautical miles from Earth, and at the conclusion they were about 52,248 nautical miles from Earth.
010:51:00|PAO|9 hundred 80 nautical miles from Earth and at the conclusion they were about 52 thousand 2 hundred 48 nautical miles from Earth.
011:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. During that last transmission you heard Cap Com Charlie Duke advise the crew that we are not seeing as high an O2, or oxygen
011:01:00|PAO|flow, as we would have expected at this point. This would indicate that the enrichment of the cabin atmosphere, which was 60 percent oxygen, 40 percent nitrogen at launch and which is normally enriched with pure oxygen during the course of the/flight, is not enriching as rapidly as we would expect. This could be a transducer problem - one of the devices that measures the O2 flow rate - or possibly a partial obstruction of one of the vents. The problem is not thought to be significant at this point, and we'll be monitoring the O2 flow during the night.
011:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 29 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We don't expect to hear a great deal more from the crew tonight. At about 11 hours, 20 minutes we said good-night to them from Mission Control and they're beginning their sleep period about 2 hours early. The additional time available for sleep was made available by deleting the mid-course correction. The first opportunity which occurred at 11 hours, 45 minutes. That mid-course correction has been moved to mid-course correction 2 to the opportunity of mid-course correction 2 of which would occur tomorrow. The last conversation we had with the crew, we received a status report and a report that they had taken no medication and were "fit as a fiddle". We also got a report from Mike Collins on the gas separation unit which is being flown on this flight. This consists of 2 stainless steel cylinders about 5 inches long and about an inch to an inch and half in diameter. The cylinders are attached to the water gun or to the water spigot on the food preparation panel and remove the gas from the water that flows through the filter. The filter actually has 2 filters inside. One which attracts water and one which repels it, in the process removing the gas. Mike Collins reported that the filters seem to be working quite well. That the water was coming out almost free of bubbles. He did report that they had a minor problem with a leak at the junction between the food bag and the filter. Mission Control advised that we would give that some thought and try to come up with some solution to it when they wake up tomorrow. At this time, Apollo 11 is 55,522 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 7920 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 32 minutes.
011:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 47 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. At this time we are receiving the television data from Goldstone. The data is coming in. It will be processed here and converted, and we estimate that it will be available for play back in about 20 to 30 minutes and we will have a firm time on that as soon as possible. At the present time Apollo 11 is 56 thousand 7 hundred 4 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity is 7 thousand 8 hundred 21 feet per second. We have had no further conversations with the crew since we passed along a good night to them at 11 hours 20 minutes. Getting them to bed about 2 hours ahead of the scheduled time on the flight plan, as a result of the deletion of mid-course correction 1. At 11 hours 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
012:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 5 minutes. We expect to have the unscheduled television transmission, which came in to Goldstone California. It was taped there and has been transmitted to Mission Control Center ready and converted for replay in color at 8:45 PM central daylight time. That would be about 7 minutes from now. The TV transmission runs for a total time of about 16 and a half minutes and there's an exterior shot out the window of the Earth. At the time of the transmission Apollo 1l was some 50 thousand 9 hundred 80 nautical miles from Earth. The transmission came into Goldstone at the ground elapsed time of 10:32:40, and ended about 16 minutes, 16 and a half minutes later, when the spacecraft was at an altitude of 52 thousand 2 hundred 48 nautical miles. We'll stand by for a replay of that transmission at 8:45 PM central daylight time.
012:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 12 minutes, and we expect to be ready to release the television transmission from the spacecraft which was received at Goldstone, California. That should be ready to go in a little less than a minute.
012:05:00|PAO|And we are starting to get lock on from the tape replay and we expect that we will have a color picture shortly.
012:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view that we have of the Earth disc at this time, as near as we can tell, the north pole is to the left of the screen - -
012:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view we have of the Earth disc at this time as near as we can tell, the north Pole is to the left of the screen. The land mass that was visible was the western coast of the United States. The Earth then would appear to be rotated 90 degrees with the North Pole to the left and South American Continent extending toward the upper right of the globe but not visible.
012:25:00|PAO|That concludes the unscheduled television transmission. That transmission came in about 2 hours ago at a ground elapsed time of 10:32:40 beginning, lasted about 16 and a half minutes. At the beginning of the transmission Apollo 11 was about 50,980 nautical miles from Earth and at the conclusion about 52,248 nautical miles. At the present time, the crew is in a scheduled rest period. They did indicate before going into the rest period, when we last heard from them, that they would probably use part of the time to get a bite to eat and then get some sleep. At this time Apollo 11 is 59,908 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,569 feet per second. At 12 hours 31 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
012:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 47 minutes. We've just put in a call to the crew. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, verified with the surgeon that they had not gone to sleep at this point and Capsule Communicator, Charlie Duke, has put in the call. We'll pick up the tape of the conversation and then stand by for any following live communication with the crew.
012:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We don't anticipate a great deal of further conversation wit the crew. We expect they will attempt to get some sleep shortly. The conversation that just ended, we advised that through one of the computer programs, the deadband for that area of excursions which the guidance system will allow before firing the RCS thrusters to correct it. It had been narrowed from 30 degrees to 1/2 a degree. What this would mean, if the RCS jets were enabled, is that unless the crew reselected the 30 degree deadband, the jets would be firing more frequently to keep the spacecraft within the narrower limits. Since the spacecraft is very stable at this point, very few wobbling motions, it was felt that the narrower deadband was acceptable; the jets are not enabled, and the crew would not be disturbed by firing of the Reaction Control System jets even if the spacecraft moved out of the 1/2-degree deadband. In the event of any large excursions, which we would not expect, based on the passive thermal control mode, used in Apollo 10. It would be possible to awaken the crew from the ground and have the situation corrected. We would not expect, however, for the spacecraft attitude to change significantly during the night, and we do intend to continue in the passive thermal control mode as it is presently set up. At this time Apollo 11 is 61,509 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,449 feet per second, which would translate to about 5,000 miles an hour. At 12 hours 54 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
013:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours, 27 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft now traveling at a speed of 7,279 feet per second, which would be about 4,963 miles an hour, and it's at a distance of 63,880 nautical miles from Earth. Our Flight Sugeon reported a short while ago that Command Module pilot, Mike Collins, appeared to be sleeping soundly at this time. Biomedical data on the other two crewmen indicates that they are still awake. We've had no further conversation with the spacecraft since our last report, and it appears that the crew will be getting some good rest either as scheduled or perhaps a little earlier than scheduled in the flight plan. At 13 hours, 28 minutes, thesis Mission Control, Houston.
014:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 14 hours 6 minute into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission is progressing very smoothly. All spacecraft systems ar functioning normally at this time, and the flight surgeon reports all three crewmen appear to be sleeping. For commander Neil Armstrong, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, they appear to have begun sleeping about 5 minutes ago. Command Module pilot Mike Collins has been asleep for about an additional 30 minutes to an hour. At the present time Apollo 11 is 66 thousand 5 hundred 54 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of about 70 thousand, or rather 7 thousand 95 feet per second, which would be about 48 hundred miles an hour. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report and as I said all 3 crewmen appear to be sleeping at this time. At 14 hours 7 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
014:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 14 hours, 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft, presently 67,819 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 7012 feet per second. Here in Mission Control, the shift change is in progress. Flight Director Glenn Lunney and his team of flight controllers coming on to replace Gene Kranz and his white team. The Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be Ron Eavans. And we anticipate that the change of shift briefing for this shift will begin in about 10 or 15 minutes. At 14 hours, 26 minutes this is Apollo Control.
015:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 15 hours, 28 minutes ground elapse time. Apollo 11 crew still asleep according to Flight Surgeon Ken Beers here in Mission Control. The flight crew is still sleeping soundly at this time according to the biomedical telemetry being beamed down to the displays on his console. Here in the Mission Control Operations Room or MCOR as it is called the black team of flight controllers is settling in for the night headed up by Flight Director Glen Lunney. Some 7 hours remaining in the crews sleep period. Distance and velocity now showing 72,009 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now 6,750 feet per second. And at 15 hours, 28 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo Control.
016:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 hours, 38 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 11, presently being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station. Geographically the spacecraft is practically directly over or out from the Philippine Islands. Now showing some 5 hours and 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. The crew still asleep at this time. Continuing to decelerate as the spacecraft gets out toward the changeover point between the Earth's sphere of influence and the Moon's sphere of influence. Velocity now showing 6493 feet per second. Apollo 11 now out 76,453 nautical miles from the Earth. And at 16 hours, 39 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
017:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 17 hours 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now some 79,700 nautical miles out from Earth at a velocity of 6320 feet per second. Telemetry display for the crew biomedical readings now shows all three men in a fairly deep sleep. The mean heart rates in the 40's for all three men. Command Module cabin pressure holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Cabin temperature is 63 degrees. No measurements on the Lunar Module in terms of cabin pressure in as much as the Lunar Module has not been activated and will not be until shortly before entering Lunar orbit and the first manning for the module is checked out, systems are checked out and closed back up again. Spacecraft analysis reports coming out of the back room here in Mission Control Center read like some of the ones in Apollo 10 toward the end of the mission when they were down to one page. And most of the entries are all systems performance normal systems operation normal, no change from last report, et cetera, et cetera. In the spacecraft fuel cell, performance is normal. And the load sharing is shown within 3.2 amps. Cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen quantities now show total oxygen at 558 pounds, 279 pounds in each of the two tanks, 49 pounds of cryogenic hydrogen, 24.2 pounds in Tank 1, 24.8 in Tank 2. And the cryogenic system is performing normal. At 17 hours 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
017:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 18 hours 38 minutes ground elapse time. Apollo 11 now some 83,644 nautical miles out from Earth, continuing to decelerate in velocity. Now some 6,114 feet per second. The reveille time for the crew of Apollo 11 in some 3 hours and 50 minutes. All systems still functioning normally aboard the spacecraft as the crew continues their nine hour rest period. All measurements normal, as the flight controllers here watch the systems on telemetry and the displays here in the Control Center. Have 18 hours 39 minutes ground elapse time. This is Apollo Control.
019:43:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 19 hours, 43 minutes ground elapse time. Crew now has some 2 hours, 46 minutes remaining in the scheduled sleep period. Distance out-bound from Earth now 87,409 nautical miles. Apollo ll's continuing to decelerate in velocity, now traveling at 5,930 feet per second. All going well in the Apollo 11 mission. Crew sleeping apparently in deep sleep. Systems still performing quite well. And at 19 hours, 43 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo Control.
020:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 20 hours 38 minutes ground elapse time. One hour 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. At this time, Apollo 11 on a line projected outward from Earth as directly over the southern tip of the Indian sub-continent. Distance now 90,509 nautical miles. Velocity continuing to decelerate, now 5,788 feet per second. The crew is still asleep at this time, and at 20 hours 39 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo control.
021:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 21 hours, 38 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 11 now being tracked by the tracking station at Madrid. Some 51 minutes remaining in the SC
022:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 22 hours, 49 minutes ground elapse time. The crew has been awake for some time according to the surgeon. Spacecraft communicator here in mission control with the green team, Bruce McCandless, is standing by to make a call to the crew. He's in the process of taking over from Ron Evans. Flight director, Cliff Charlesworth, has asked that he make a call to the crew. We're standing by for this call momentarily.
023:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours 22 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 99,308 nautical miles. Velocity is 5411 feet per second. The spacecraft weight is 96,361 pounds. A flight dynamics officer reports that in terms of distance Apollo 11 will reach the half-way mark at 25 hours 0 minutes 53 seconds. At that time the spacecraft will be 104,350 miles from both the Earth and the Moon.
023:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours, 48 minutes. Capcom Bruce McCandless is getting ready to put in a call to the crew momentarily. Apollo 11's distance now is 100,685 nautical miles. Velocity 5356 feet per second.
023:59:00|PAO|Apollo 11 is now going out of the passive thermal control mode in which it was slowly rotating to maintain thermal balance. They're getting set up for the P23 activities. That's the mid-course navigation. Capcom Bruce McCandtess is passing up some changes in the procedures for this navigational operation.
023:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 hours 22 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 102,436 nautical miles, velocity 5288 feet per second.
024:24:00|PAO|Star 37 is Nunki. Apollo 11 is now in program 52 which is realignment of the platform prior to beginning the cislunar navigation operation.
025:04:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That reading was the difference in pressure between the Lunar Module cabin and the Command Module cabin.
025:04:00|PAO|This is Jim Lovell calling Apollo 11.
025:04:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 20 minutes. Apollo 11 -
025:04:00|PAO|Distance is now 103,263 nautical miles. Velocity 5,256 feet per second.
025:04:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Delay that last announcement. Those figures are not based on the proper ground elapsed time. This display is static. We don't have the present numbers.
025:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 58 minutes. Apollo 11's distance is now 107,224 nautical miles. Velocity 5,106 feet per second.
025:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours. The ignition time for this mid-course correction will be 26 hours, 44 minutes, 57 seconds - about 44 minutes from now. It will be a service propulsion maneuver. Duration of the burn will be 3 seconds, the delta-V 21.3 feet per second.
025:50:00|PAO|This mid-course maneuver should reduce the pericynthion of Apollo 11's trajectory from the present 175 nautical miles to 60 nautical miles.
026:15:00|PAO|The Guidance Officer reports Apollo 11 is now in the attitude for the mid-course correction.
026:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours, 27 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now 108,594 nautical miles. Velocity 5,057 feet per second. We're about 17 and a half minutes away from the mid-course correction.
026:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours and 40 minutes. We're Just under 4 minutes to the mid-course correction maneuver. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 109,245 nautical miles. Its velocity is 5,033 feet per second. Spacecraft weight 96,361 pounds.
026:35:00|PAO|One minute to the burn. The duration will be 3 seconds. Burning. Shutdown.
026:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That was a good burn. The residuals are on the order of a half a foot a second or less, and will not be trimmed. We're showing spacecraft weight now as 96,159 pounds.
026:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours, Apollo 11's distance now 110,198 nautical miles. Velocity 4984 feet per second.
026:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours, 7 minutes. The crew is now is the process -
027:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The passive thermal control being reestablished by Apollo 11 is at the rate of three-tenths of a degree per second which would be three rotations per hour.
027:08:00|PAO|That's Jim Lovell, the commander of the backup of Apollo 11 crew communicating with Apollo 11 at the present time. He also commanded the Gemini 12 flight in which Buzz Aldrin was his pilot.
027:19:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin giving the description of what he could see on the Earth. The backup Lunar Module Pilot Fred Hayes is also in the Control Center at the present time.
027:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours 46 minutes. Apollo ll's distance from the Earth is now 112,386 nautical miles, velocity 4,906 feet per second. We now have the actual numbers on the mid-course correction maneuver. Ignition time was 26 hours 44 minutes 57.92 seconds. Duration of the burn was 2.91 seconds. DELTA-V 20.9 feet per second.
028:04:00|PAO|That's Mike Collins talking.
028:04:00|PAO|And Bruce McCandless is back on the CAPCOM console now,
028:39:00|PAO|At 28 hours 40 minutes, we're showing Apollo 11's distance as 114,922 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 4,819 feet per second. The crew is eating lunch at the present time, and it sounds like there music in the background that they are enjoying during their lunch period.
028:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is now 115,837 nautical miles, velocity 4,788 feet per second. Spacecraft weight 96,117 pounds.
029:04:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours, 20 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is now 116,747 nautical miles, velocity 4,758 feet per second. One of the clocks in the Control Center is now displaying the time to landing, the landing timing based on the time in the flight plan. It shows we're 73 hours, 26 minutes, 30 seconds from the lunar landing.
029:24:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
029:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours 40 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth 117,682 nautical miles, velocity 4726 feet per second.
030:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 30 hours into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 105,853 nautical miles, velocity 4233 feet per second. And that was Neil Armstrong conducting a conversation with CAPCOM Bruce McCandless on the O2 flow rate transducer.
030:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a correction on those last distances and velocities. That distance and velocity is in reference to the Moon instead of the Earth. To the Moon - Apollo 11's distance from the Moon is 105,729 nautical miles at the present time and the velocity in reference to the Moon is 4230 feet per second.
030:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 119,116 nautical miles. Its Earth referenced inertial velocity, 4679 feet per second.
030:14:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on the present trajectory, Apollo 11 will enter the lunar sphere of influence as an elapsed time of 61 hours, 39 minutes, 58 seconds.
030:14:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Goldstone reports they are receiving TV from the spacecraft and are recording it.
030:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We do not have lines called up between here and Goldstone at the
030:31:00|PAO|present time, so we cannot receive the pictures in Houston. Goldstone is recording. The lines will be up for the scheduled TV pass, approximately 6:30 this evening, Central Daylight Time.
030:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The tape from this unscheduled TV pass will probably be fed from Goldstone to Houston following the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening.
031:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 5 minutes and here in Mission Control we're changing shifts at this time. Flight Director Gene Krantz is replacing Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth and our Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Charlie Duke.
031:01:00|PAO|Apollo 11, at this time, is 121,158 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 4613 feet per second. We anticipate that the change of shift briefing will begin at about 4:00 P.M. Central Daylight Time.
031:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 22 minutes. We're scheduled to begin the change of shift briefing shortly. During the briefing we will record any conversations with the crew and play those back following the briefing. At 31 hours, 22 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
032:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 21 minutes. During the Change of Shift Press Conference we had about 3 minutes of conversation with the crew. During that conversation, Buzz Aldrin reported on - what appeared to be a weather disturbance off Cuba and the Caribbean and we also had some descriptions from Aldrin on the view of Earth from the spacecraft's present position. We'll played that back for you now and then stand by for any further live conversation with the crew.
032:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 39 minutes. This is a relative quiet period in the flight plan. The crew will be getting the spacecraft set up for the passive thermal control termination, and the Television transmission. Capcom Charlie Duke has just put in a call. We'll pick that up.
032:51:00|PAO|Mike Collins is sending us this description from about 126,000 miles from Earth.
033:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 34 minutes. We've been advised that we are getting television transmission from Goldstone at the present time. This is an unscheduled TV transmission apparently of the crew checking out their onboard system.
033:26:00|PAO|We have lost lock on the high gain antenna at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 127,991 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4400 feet per second. The regularly scheduled time for the television transmission is 6:47 p.m. Central Daylight Time, and we are anticipating that that transmission will occur as scheduled.
033:26:00|PAO|We're getting momentary lock-on. We seem to have a somewhat better picture now. Here's a call to the crew from Capcom Charlie Duke.
033:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 41 minutes. We are going to be standing by here in Mission Control for the possibility that the crew would want to transmit that television pass early. The scheduled time for it was 6:47 Central Daylight time and about 15 minutes was scheduled. That would be at a ground elapsed time of 34 hours and we will have the system set up here in Mission Control to receive and release television should the crew decide to send us the transmission early.
033:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 45 minutes and we do have a correction to the time given for the beginning of that TV nominally. The flight time is beginning at 34 hours to 34 hours, 15 minutes ground elapsed time. The previous conversion of that, that we gave you for Central Daylight Time was in error, it should be 6:32 P.M. Central Daylight Time beginning, assuming we start as the flight plan nominally has a transmission listed at 34 hours ground elapsed time. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 128,431 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off slowly, now reads 4386 feet per second.
033:41:00|PAO|You've heard that comment from the crew. They've stopped their passive thermal control, they're starting up the TV and we'll be standing by for - for a picture.
033:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours 57 minutes and we are less than 3 minutes now from the scheduled television transmission. From Apollo 11, we are continuing to standby for that. We have also been asked to advised that the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10:00 PM has been postponed for 24 hours. As a repeat, the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10 PM has been postponed for 24 hours. Further details on that will be available in the News Center.
033:59:00|PAO|This view is coming to us from about 129,000 nautical miles.
034:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo control. That TV transmission lasted about 35 minutes.
034:46:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 46 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4300 feet per second. During the TV transmission the crew advised that they may possibly be able to take the color television camera into the Lunar Module with them tomorrow at about 56 hours, 30 minutes, ground elapsed time. They reported that the cables had been checked and are perfectly long enough to take them into the Lunar Module. During the next hour or so the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving on, getting the crew set up for their rest period and eat period. This will be a very long rest period tonight, scheduled 10 hours. That will begin according to the flight plan, at about 37 hours, ground elapsed time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the flight plan, that perhaps again tonight we would be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early. At 34 hours, 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
035:13:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently about 93,265 nautical miles from the Moon and with respect to the Moon is traveling at a speed of about 4019 feet per second. At this time we are receiving the tape play-back which Goldstone, tracking site at Goldstone, California received from the spacecraft in that earlier unscheduled TV transmission. This was a test of the system using the spacecraft on the antennas, the small OMNI directional antennas. Normally transmissions from this distance in space would be - would require the high-gain antenna. This television transmission is being processed and converted to color and we anticipate that we'll have it available for playback at about 9:00 P.M. We are in conversation with the spacecraft at this time. We'll pick up the tape recorded conversation that we have and then stand by to follow any live conversation.
036:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At the present time we are handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California, to the site at Honeysuckle which accounts for the noise in the transmission -
036:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours 11 minutes. At the present time Apollo 11 is 134,000 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity is 4216 feet per second. During
036:03:00|PAO|that last series of transmissions from the crew, we received a status report from Buzz Aldrin and he reported that the crew has in the past 24 hours taken no medication. This is similar to the crew status report we received from them last night. We bid them good night at 36 hours 9 minutes or about 2 minutes ago. We anticipate that the crew will probably have a few more housekeeping type chores aboard the spacecraft before they actually turn in and also we'll probably be combining their eat period with the first part of that sleep period. At 36 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control Houston.
036:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 27 minutes. We have completed the processing of the unscheduled television transmission which the crew sent down from the spacecraft at about 30 hours, 24 minutes ground elapsed time this evening. I would like to repeat that this was an apparent test of the onboard system. The crew turned the television equipment on and left it on for about 52 minutes. Some of the time we will have a picture of the parts of it. We don't have good lock-on, and I will not have a good solid picture. We should also point out that this transmission was made with the OMNI directional antennas, which, of course, don't provide nearly the signal strength that we would get from the high gain antenna, which would be used. We'll play back the tape of that transmission for you at this time.
036:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view that we have at the present time appears to be out the window of the Command Module looking at the Lunar Module docking target.
036:37:00|PAO|And we seem to have a fairly good view here of the interior of the Command Module. This would look to be the panel, display panel with some of the fuel quantity dials on the right side of the cockpit.
036:37:00|PAO|At the time these television pictures were transmitted from the spacecraft, Apollo 11 was about 121 thousand nautical miles from Earth. Where we do have signal lock on we got amazingly good quality on those little omni antennas. As we had mentioned before, normally the high gain antenna would be used for television transmission of this sort.
036:37:00|PAO|And we could almost make out a face in that one, and somebody's hand down at the instrument panel.
036:37:00|PAO|That last view just before we lost picture lock up appeared to be the right center portion of the main display console, main display panel in the Command Module.
036:47:00|PAO|For a brief moment there we had a picture of a somewhat placid Neil Armstrong closing his eyes momentarily. Another crewman to his left, I'm not sure at this point, that I can make out who it was, it did appear it might have been Mike Collins.
036:47:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins commenting that he was doing some running in place exercises, and we may get a brief view of that a little later on in this transmission if this picture stabilizes and holds still for us.
037:07:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That concludes the replay of the test transmission from Apollo 11. That transmission occurred about 2 hours prior to the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening. The crew, apparently, testing out the onboard system, and we received about 52 minutes of intermittent television using the spacecraft OMNI directional antennas. And as you could see, as particularly near the end, this is just - appears to be just about the limit television reception from the OMNI antennas. At the time of the transmission, Apollo 11 was about 121,000 nautical miles from Earth. During the replay of that television transmission, we accumulated a very short amount of tape, one or two brief comments from the crew who are in their sleep period at this time. We'll play back that tape conversation for you now.
037:17:00|PAO|- replay of the test transmission from Apollo 11. That transmission occurred about 2 hours prior to the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening. The crew apparently testing out the onboard system. We received about 52 minutes of intermittent television using the spacecraft OMNI directional antennas. As you can see it is particularly near the end. This is just - appears to be just about the limit of television reception from the OMNI antennas. At the time of the transmission, Apollo 11 was about 121,000 nautical miles from Earth. During the replay of that television transmission, we accumulated a very short amount of tape. One or two brief comments from the crew who are in their sleep period at this time. We will play back the tape conversation for you now.
037:17:00|PAO|At this time Apollo 11 is 137,219 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4132 feet per second. Here at Mission Control things have settled down into a rather quiet nighttime routine. We said good night to the crew about 36 hours - 36 hours 9 minutes to be exact, a little over a hour ago. We did hear from them once or twice since then and we anticipate that this time are probably getting settled down to begin their 10 hours sleep period. At 37 hours 21 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
038:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 38 hours 26 minutes. Here in Mission Control, we are presently going through the shift change. Flight Director Glenn Lunney and his team of flight controllers are coming on to replace Gene Kranz. The capsule communicator on the upcoming shift will be astronaut Ron Evans. Flight Surgeon John Ziegleschmidt reported that two of the 3 crewmen apparently began sleeping at about 38 hours ground elapsed time or about 26 minutes ago, and the two that are asleep are Command Module pilot, Mike Collins and Commander Neil Armstrong. Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin at last report was still awake. We expect the change of shift press briefing will occur at about 11:15 central daylight time. At 38 hours 27 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
039:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 39 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew at this time all three soundly asleep. The space digitals display - stand by. The space digitals display here in Mission Control now showing 82,905 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity 3897 feet per second relative to the Moon. Awake time 7 hours 19 minutes away. Spacecraft presently over the west-central Pacific, if a line were projected back toward its nearest point on Earth. And at 39 hours 41 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
040:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 40 hours 58 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 11 presently 146,300 nautical miles up from Earth. Velocity 3,917 feet per second. Six hours 1 minute remaining in the sleep period - the ten hour sleep period schedule in the flight plan. Rather quiet here during the night watch or the black team which tonight is being headed up by flight director Jerry Griffin who is spelling the usual black team flight director, Gene Lunney. One clock here in mission control shows landing time 61 hours 48 minutes from now. This is similar to the entry clock which the - is used in the same position in the control room toward the end of a mission, will be refined continuously as we get down to the gnats hair, the exact second of landing. At 40 hours 59 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
043:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 43 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 11 presently on the spot directly above or directly out from the Malay Peninsula. Some 3 hours 30 minutes remaining in the scheduled 10 hour sleep period for the crew. And if the space digital display were up here at the time coming out of the computer we would know what the distance and velocity were. So, at 43 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
044:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 44 hours, 28 minutes ground elapse time. Apollo 11 crew has another 2 hours, 31 minutes remaining in their 10 hour sleep period. The spacecraft is now some 72,010 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity continuing to decelerate as we'get nearer the change over point in influence between the Earth and the Moon. Velocity now showing 3,811 feet per second. The spacecraft now calculated to weigh 96,068 pounds. At 44 hours, 29 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo Control.
045:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 45 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A little more than an hour remaining in the Apollo 11 crew sleep period. Present velocity, 3799 feet per second. Distance from Moon, 69,810 nautical miles. Apollo 11 will continue decelerating as it gets to the point where the Moon's sphere of influence overcomes the Earth's sphere of influence. This point will take place - This event will take place at 61 hours 39 minutes and 57 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, according to the Flight Dynamics Officer. At this point, the spacecraft-to-Moon distance will be 33,822 nautical miles, spacecraft-to-Earth distance, 186,437 nautical miles. The velocity will have slowed to a relative crawl at this point. The Earth referenced 2990 feet per second, Moon referenced 3772 feet per second. Clock counting down to lunar touchdown, which as mentioned before will likely be changed as the spacecraft goes into lunar orbit and the data is refined, some of the times change a few seconds one way or the other. At any rate, the landing clock now showing 57 hours 17 minutes until lunar landing. At 45 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
046:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 46 hours 28 minutes ground elapsed time. A little more than a half hour remaining in the crew sleep period. Members of the green team of flight controllers headed up by prime flight director Cliff Charlesworth are coming into the control room at this time, and at each console, a handover is taking place from the black watch. At the time - at the present time, the Apollo 11 spacecraft is 67,518 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3787 feet per second. Apollo 11 presently is being tracked by the Madrid S-band station, and at 46 hours 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
046:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. The green team led by flight director Cliff Charlesworth has just relieved Glen Lunney's black team. The flight surgeon, Dr. Willard Hawkins indicates the crew appears to be still asleep. We're nearing the end of the scheduled rest period. Cliff Charlesworth indicates. We will put in a call to the crew within a few minutes. Apollo 11 is 158,681 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3578 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 96,068 pounds.
046:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours, 3 minutes. Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew sleep a little longer. He's just had a conversation with the flight surgeon. Dr. Hawkins reports all indications are that the crew is sleeping soundly. The flight plan does not warrant awaking them just to get them up. There's nothing in the flight plan that requires their attention at the present time, so the flight director has made a decision to not put in a call to the crew and wake them. Flight surgeon says that a look at the data throughout the night indicates that the crew slept rather well all night.
047:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours 41 minutes into the mission. From all indications the crew is still alseep. We're 41 minutes past the end of the scheduled 10 hour rest period now. Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew remain asleep and not awaken them from the ground. There is no need to awaken them. Nothing scheduled in the flight plan that requires their attention at this time. Apollo 11 is 160,137 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3544 feet per second.
048:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours into the Apollo 11 mission. The spacecraft is 160,760 nautical miles from Earth. The distance from the Moon is 64,115 nautical miles. The Earth referenced velocity is 3529 feet per second. The rest period has now lasted an hour longer than the 10-hour period scheduled. It is extended to 11 hours now. Flight Surgeon says there ate indications that the commander, Neil Armstrong, may be awakening. There is some stirring around, however, we have not yet put in a call to the crew. The mid-course correction 3, which was scheduled for this afternoon at an elapsed time of 53 hours, 54 minutes, has been canceled. The velocity value for that mid-course is only eight-tenths of a foot per second, so we will not do mid-course correction No. 3. We'll continue to stand by for either a call from the ground or a call from the spacecraft.
048:09:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours, 9 minutes. We just put in a call to the crew. Here's that conversation.
048:09:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That first conversation was with Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins joined in. We've not yet heard from Neil Armstrong.
048:19:00|PAO|That would be Armstrong 8, Collins 9, Aldrin 8.
048:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The flight surgeon reports that is not a record for sleep. The Apollo 10 crew during one rest period logged 10 hours of sleep.
048:29:00|PAO|That's Buzz Aldrin with the description.
048:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 7 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 163,040 miles from Earth, velocity 3,476 feet per second.
049:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours, 52 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 164,558 nautical miles. It's velocity is 3441 feet per second.
050:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours 16 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 165,346 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3423 feet per second. Flight controllers report all systems well within the normal and operating very satisfactorily.
050:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 40 minutes. Apollo 11 is 166,135 miles from Earth. The Capcom is going to take a radio check here, I think, with the crew.
050:21:00|PAO|FAO is the Flight Activities Office.
050:41:00|PAO|Apollo 11's velocity is 3404 feet per second. Spacecraft's still in the passive thermal control mode rotating at .3 of a degree per second or 3 revolutions per hour. Sporadic bursts of static that you hear on the air-ground is caused by the rotation of the spacecraft - changing the orientation of the antennas as the spacecraft slowly rotates to maintain thermal balance.
050:41:00|PAO|The back-up Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise is at the Capcom console with Bruce McCandless.
050:41:00|PAO|That radio check was with the Apollo 11 commander, Neil Armstrong.
050:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 53 minutes into the mission. An important news release will be available in the Apollo News Center at 11:45 Central Daylight Time this morning. At noon, Colonel Frank Borman will be in the building 1 auditorium at MSC for a briefing concerning the news release. Repeating, an important news release will be available at 11:45 a.m. central daylight time in the Apollo news center at MSC.
050:54:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, 7 minutes. Apollo 7 - Apollo 11's distance is 167,007 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,386 feet per second.
051:14:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours 55 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 167,594 nautical miles from Earth, moving toward the Moon at a velocity of 3373 feet per second. All systems are normal. We will be utilizing this release line for the Col. Frank Borman briefing. During that briefing we will tape any air-ground transmissions and play them back after the briefing. This is Mission Control Houston.
051:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 168,658 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 3,349 feet per second. We have 30 seconds of air-ground conversation taped during the news briefing. We'll play that for you now.
052:15:00|PAO|Apollo 11 is 170,010 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3319 feet per second.
052:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours, 53 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11 is 170,746 nautical miles from Earth, velocity is 3303 feet per second. The crew is now in the process of realigning the spacecraft's inertial platform.
053:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 20 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 171,293 nautical miles, traveling at a velocity of 3291 feet per second. The spacecraft's weight is 6068 pounds.
053:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a correction on the orbital parameters of Luna 15 as given in the news briefing recently. The parameters given in that briefing of 72 by 156 nautical miles were based on a computation from an orbital period of 2 hours and 30 minutes instead of the correct 2 hours and 30 seconds. The orbit has been recomputed based on the proper numbers and the parameters for Luna 15, based on a period of 2 hours 30 seconds are 30 by 110 nautical miles, a perilune of 30, an apolune of 110 nautical miles.
053:55:00|PAO|That's Mike Collins from the spacecraft.
053:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 54 hours, 6 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now is 172,748 nautical miles, traveling at a velocity of 3260 feet per second.
053:55:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong confirming they will attempt TV at approximately an elapsed time of 56 hours 20 minutes and then the last of the question was by Buzz Aldrin.
054:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 45 minutes. Apollo 11 is 173,997 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 3,234 feet per second. In the Control Center, the white team led by Gene Kranz is preparing to relieve Cliff Charlesworth and the green team. Capcom is Charlie Duke. We're estimating the change of shift news conference for 4:00 PM Central Daylight Time.
055:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 55 hours 10 minutes. Our network controllers just advised that we are receiving live television at Goldstone. We would presume this is a test of the system, similar to what we received from the crew yesterday. The crew is planning to send television from the Lunar Module when they ingress. Stand by - here's a call from the crew.
055:00:00|PAO|That was Capcom, Charlie Duke, advising the crew that we are not quite prepared for television reception at this time. You heard Mike Collins respond that this one is for free. We still intend to get the television transmission during the time the crew is in the Lunar Module, beginning about 56 hours 20 minutes ground elapsed time, which would be about 4:52 PM central daylight time. We are getting a black and white television picture in the Control Center at this time and we should have that in color by now. An anterior view of the Command Module looking up into the LM hatch, CSM land hatch area. We can't quite make out which crewman we're seeing up in the tunnel working with the probe and drogue assembly.
055:00:00|PAO|Getting a very good view of the work going on in the command and Service Module tunnel. It appears to be Neil Armstrong working in the tunnel. Working on the drogue and probe assembly. This extremely sharp clear picture is coming to us from about a 175 thousand miles distance from Earth.
055:15:00|PAO|extremely sharp picture is coming to us from about 175,000 miles distance from Earth. Presently about 48,000 miles from the Moon.
055:15:00|PAO|That appears as if it might be all the free TV, as Mike Collins put it. After we got in we expect to get the television transmission from the time the crew is in the Lunar Module and that period of activity is scheduled to begin in about 56 hours 20 minutes with the ingress to the Lunar Module. And we understand it's starting to get a picture back again. It was in lock momentarily and now we had it back again. Neil Armstrong up in the tunnel at this point, removing the probe and drogue assembly in preparation for the ingress to the Lunar Module. A network controller just reported that this television is coming to us on the 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California.
055:15:00|PAO|We just saw the probe assembly start to come loose now as Neil Armstrong is -
055:15:00|PAO|Once removal of the drogue is completed, they will have access to the LM hatch and be able to go into the tunnel.
055:25:00|PAO|This unscheduled televison transmission has now run about 18 minutes, and we have no estimate at this point as to how long it will continue. Mike Collins reported that it would - we would go ahead with the regularly scheduled one when they are in the LM.
055:25:00|PAO|Have a good view here of the computer display and keyboard assembly with the green lights flashing.
055:25:00|PAO|The reference to the roll cal, or roll calibration index marker in the tunnel, which shows how far off exact 0 the 2 vehicles were when the docking occurred.
055:25:00|PAO|Mike Collins reporting there on the appearance of the latches.
055:25:00|PAO|An interested observer of these amazingly clear pictures coming to us from more than 175,000 miles out in space is Astronaut Gene Cernan, who got a first hand view of some of this same area of the spacecraft during his Apollo 10 flight.
055:35:00|PAO|That conversation between Charlie Duke and Mike Collins referring to the automatic light that comes on in the LM when the hatch is opened.
055:35:00|PAO|Buzz Aldrin, reporting that he's halfway into the LM. His view is inside the LM cabin.
055:35:00|PAO|Buzz Aldrin has apparently carried the camera into the LM with him, showing us Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins back in the CSM.
055:35:00|PAO|This ingress to the Lunar Module came about -
055:45:00|PAO|This ingress to the Lunar Module came about 40 minutes ahead of the flight plan, and we would presume that the unscheduled TV is perhaps merging with the schedule a little bit early.
055:45:00|PAO|Aldrin's hand resting on one of the portable life support systems which will be used on the Moons surface.
055:45:00|PAO|We're not quite sure who's holding the camera at this point. Apparently it's drifting freely inside the cabin. Or more likely attached to some convenient point within the LM cabin.
055:45:00|PAO|This television transmission has now been running about 42 minutes, and the spacecraft now about 176 thousand miles from Earth.
055:45:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong has apparently been holding the camera, looking back down through the tunnel it appears now that he's handed the camera to Buz Aldrin. As he is still looking back through the tunnel we see Mike Collins in the background there.
055:55:00|PAO|This transmission has been running about 54 minutes at this point.
055:55:00|PAO|At this point, we have had to take the color down momentarily. We - -
056:05:00|PAO|At this point, we've had to take the color down momentarily. We've run out of tape in the color conversion recorder. We estimate we'll have the black and white for about 5 minutes while the tape changes in process and then continue to convert in color after that point.
056:05:00|PAO|The black and white view that you're seeing now is the unconverted color pictures that comes down from the spacecraft. The flicker, of course, is taken out in the conversion process. We've now been receiving television pictures from the spacecraft for about 1 hour.
056:05:00|PAO|The reference to the friendly geologist refers to Astronaut Jack Schmitt who is here in the Control Center.
056:05:00|PAO|Now we're back with the color.
056:25:00|PAO|We've been receiving television now from the spacecraft for about an hour and 20 minutes. Apollo 11 presently 177,000 miles from Earth.
056:35:00|PAO|It appears now that we have a view of Earth out the window.
056:35:00|PAO|That description from Neil Armstrong?
056:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That
056:35:00|PAO|television transmission lasted about 1 hour 36 minutes according to our first rough calculation. And during that period of time, the spacecraft traveled something over 2000 nautical miles - -
056:45:00|PAO|- one hour 36 minutes according to our first rough calculations. During that period of time, the spacecraft traveled something over 2000 nautical miles.
056:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 56 hours 51 minutes. Buzz Aldrin has now been in the Lunar Module for a little over an hour and 13 minutes. We estimate that Neil Armstrong has perhaps been in the LM about 15 or 20 minutes less than that. Due to the length of that television transmission, the change of shift press conference has been canceled. The participants were unable to wait for the duration of the press conference and with other duties and the press conference has been canceled. At 56 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
056:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 3 minutes. The decision as you heard relayed up to the crew there, that we would go into the passive thermal control mode with the spacecraft in a slow roll at 58 hours in the flight plan. I would rule out further television for today. I would also like to repeat that the change of shift press conference for the previous shift was canceled due to the length of that television transmission, and we do expect to have a change of shift briefing following this shift probably between 11:30 and 12:pm CDT. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 178,236 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity has dropped down now to 3146 feet per second. At 57 hours, 4 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
057:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 44 minutes. We've had no further reports from the crew to indicate whether or not Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have returned to the Command Module. And I guess that would answer our question. Neil Armstrong reporting that they are finished with their work in the LM, will be coming out shortly. Apollo 11 is now 179,490 nautical miles from Earth. Traveling at a speed of 3,121 feet per second. In a little less than 3 hours, we'll pass a milestone of sorts, as the spacecraft passes into the lunar sphere of influence. And what we mean by that, is that at that point, the spacecraft will be under the dominant influence of the Moon's gravity. The Moon's gravitational force will have the predominant effect on the trajectory of the spacecraft. And at that point, our displays in Mission Control monitoring velocity and altitude will switch from Earth reference to Moon reference. We'll then begin monitoring the progress of the spacecraft as it continues to accelerate toward the Moon. At 57 hours 46 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
058:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That was Neil Armstrong reporting that they are now reinstalling the probe and drogue, which is just about on the flight plan schedule, and they reported that they would be putting the spacecraft in a slow roll shortly to maintain passive thermal control. In that mode the spacecraft rotates at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain even heating. We have a precise time on that sphere of influence change, the point of which the Moon - for calculation purposes here. Mission Control, comes under the predominate influence - the spacecraft comes under the predominate influence of the Moon's gravitational field, and we now calculate that that will occur at 61 hours, 39 minutes, 55 seconds, ground elapsed time.
058:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. Apollo 11 now 182,000 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity down to 3072 feet per second. We've had very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the flight plan calls for the crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the flight plan to pass along. The television transmission which had been scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to 100 hours, 50 minutes in the flight plan has been deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission from the flight plan was made due to a lack of available satellite channels to relay the signal from the tracking site of Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape, the music of course is erased, and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft.
058:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That comment a moment ago about the tenth anniversary of - about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along with John Young flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18 through July 21, 1966.
059:16:00|PAO|about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along with John Young flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18th through July 21, 1966. The brief bit of music that we got from the spacecraft was coming to us from a distance of 182 thousand 190 nautical miles.
059:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours 57 minutes. A few moments ago you heard Capcom Charlie Duke advise the crew to terminate the passive thermal control mode that they are presently in and reestablish the three revolution per hour roll rate about the spacecraft longitudinal axis that is used for thermal control. We had noticed a unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode ideally it would roll about the longitudinal axis with very little wobble and if wobble is introduced for one reason or another, the Reaction Control System jets would come on as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had occurred and gone beyond prescribed limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct. The jet firings on past missions do tend to disturb the crews sleep. Rather than have the Reaction Control System jets come on during the night and perhaps have to awaken the crew to reestablish the passive thermal control at that time we elected to correct it now.
060:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're getting quite a bit of noise on the air-to-ground circuit at this time as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna around to the next and we momentarily lose lock-on. At this time, Apollo 11 is 183,544 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity, holding fairly constant now, at about 3042 feet per second. It's been moving down towards 3000 feet per second and seems to be leveling off somewhat.
060:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're going to take the air-to-ground circuit down temporarily until a stronger antenna lock is - . Here's a call to the crew. We'll stand by for that.
060:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We will take down the air-to-ground circuit down at this time until we reestablish sufficient signal strength to eliminate the noise on the circuit.
060:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 10 minutes. We've reestablished good antenna lock-on this time, and we'll continue to monitor for any conversation from the spacecraft. The crew is presently reestablishing the passive thermal control rotation rate of 3 revolutions per hour. Following that we expect they will begin their rest period. At the present time Apollo 11 is 183,821 nautical miles from Earth at a velocity 3037 feet per second.
060:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 37 minutes. We said good bye - goodnight to the crew about 10 minutes ago. We expect that they will be settling down their rest period shortly. And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest in a comment made by Neil Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a contingency EVA. It would have no function in a normal mission such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the command Service Module, the light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would - repeat, that it'd have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that we get and play those back. The passive thermal control mode, which was reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally. At 100 - rather 60 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
060:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control an 60 hours 47 minutes. We just got a call from the spacecraft requesting that we give them the position of the S-IVB in respect to the spacecraft and we're currently coming up with that bit of information, so we'll stand by.
061:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 61 hours, 39 minutes. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report. Flight Surgeon says there is no indication at this time that they have begun to sleep, but we expect they'll be getting to sleep here shortly. Coming up in less than 10 seconds now, we'll be crossing into the sphere of influence of the Moon. A computational changeover will be made here in Mission Control. At this point as the Moon's gravitational force becomes the dominant effect on the spacecraft trajectory, and our displays will shift from Earth reference to Moon reference. At that point, which occurred a few seconds ago, the spacecraft was at a distance of 186,437 nautical miles from Earth, and 33,822 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity with respect to the Earth was 2990 feet per second, and with respect to the Moon, about 3272 feet per second. The passive thermal control mode that was set up for the second time by the crew appears to be holding well at this point, and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally. Mission going very smoothly. At 61 hours, 41 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
062:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 62 hours 29 minutes. The flight surgeon reports that the crew appears to have been asleep now for about the past 30 minutes. The spacecraft appears to be holding its passive thermal control attitude very well and at this time Apollo 11 is about 32,000 miles from the Moon traveling at a speed of 3,782 feet per second. In the past 50 minutes or so, we have seen that velocity increase about 10 feet per second going from 3772 feet per second to the present 3782 as the spacecraft continues to accelerate toward the Moon. The Change of Shift Briefing following this shift will occur at about 11:15 PM Central Daylight Time. Flight Director Glynn Lunney and his team of flight controllers are coming on now being debriefed by the Eugene Kranz team and that shift change will be occurring shortly here. The new capsule communicator will be astronaut Ron Evans. At 62 hours 30 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
063:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 63 hours 29 minutes ground elapse time. Some 5 1/2 hours remaining in the Apollo 11 crew scheduled rest period. Crew apparently soundly asleep at this time. Spacecraft now 29,715 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity now 3,796 feet per second. Black team flight director Glynn Lunney going around the room discussing with the various flight control positions the situation for the sleep shift. Talking now to flight dynamics officer on the pros and cons of doing or not doing mid course correction burn number 4. And at 63 hours 30 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo Control.
064:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 64 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 4 1/2 hours remaining now in the scheduled Apollo 11 crew sleep period. However, since there is little likelihood that mid-course correction burn number 4 will be done, since it's a very small magnitude maneuver, that the crew will be allowed to sleep another couple of hours. At this time, Apollo 11 is some 27,529 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,812 feet per second. The black team of flight controllers has settled in for the night. Everything running quiet here in the control room. We're anticipating a playback of yesterday afternoon's TV transmission from Apollo 11 which lasted some hour and a half in which the camera was taken into the Lunar Module at the end of it's cable. This will be played back for the flight controllers who, at that time, were - most of them were asleep. At 64 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
065:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 65 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. 3 I/2 hours remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew of Apollo 11, however this will likely run into more like 5 1/2 hours remaining. Countdown clock for lunar landing now showing 37 hours, 18 minutes. Apollo 11 now 25,280 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling in a velocity of 3832 feet per second. In terms of distance. Stand by, we thought we had some Earth reference numbers, but apparently that display is not up at this time. Present weight of the spacecraft 96,029 pounds. Presently being tracked by the tracking station at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia. And at 65 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
066:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 66 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently 22,952 nautical miles out from the Moon, and traveling at a velocity of 3858 feet per second. 2 hours 29 minutes remaining in the sleep period. However, as mentioned earlier, this likely will run another 2 hours. Clock counting down to lunar landing, showing 36 hours 16 minutes. Still tracking through the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station, and all is rather quiet here in the Control Center during the sleep watch. At 66 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
067:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 67 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. mid-course correction burn number 4 has been deleted from the Flight Plan on the recommendation to Flight Director Glynn Lunney from the Flight Dynamics Officer, Jay Green. The maneuver, had it been carried out as planned, would be in the neighborhood of one-half foot per second velocity change. As it is now, the trajectory is being predicted to arrive at near point or closest approach of about 62 nautical miles plus or minus two miles if nothing else is done to the trajectory. That is if no maneuver is made. The spacecraft cabin pressure now holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Temperature 60 degrees F. The planned sleep period has another hour and one-half to go but as mentioned earlier it will likely run another couple hours in as much as mid-course correction burn number 4 will not be made and the crew will not have to spend the time preparing to do the burn, align the platform and do all the chores necessary for doing a maneuver of this sort. Clock counting down to lunar landing showing 35 hours, 17 minutes. And at 67 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
068:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 68 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 2 hours and 31 minutes remaining crew sleep period according to the revised schedule inasmuch as mid-course correction burn number 4 has been omitted. Still being tracked - Apollo 11 is still being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station. And, here in mission yesterday's hour and a half long television pass as the crew manned the LM for the first time in checkout is being replayed. This will be piped across to the news center for anyone who might want to view it again. At 68 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
069:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. So much for that. Looks like they'd rather turn over and go back to sleep. At 69 hours, 19 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
070:30:00|PAO|Planned wake-up time for the crew is 71 hours elapsed. Cliff Charlesworth and the Green team of flight controllers has just relieved Glynn Lenney's Black team. Capcom now is Bruce McCandless. Apollo 11 is 13,638 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity, 4047 feet per second, lunar reference.
071:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, at 71 hours into the mission. Apollo 11 is 12,486 nautical miles from the Moon. Approaching at a velocity of 4,087 feet per second. We will stand by here and see whether we put in a call to the crew.
071:00:00|PAO|We're putting a call into the crew now.
071:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 71 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now 11,232 nautical miles approaching at a velocity of 4,141 feet per second.
017:34:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins reporting.
017:34:00|PAO|That last transmission was from Neil Armstrong.
071:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours, 7 minutes. Apollo 11 is 9761 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 4217 feet per second. Weight 9612 pounds.
071:59:00|PAO|That was a Mike Collins comment.
072:29:00|PAO|That was Fred Haise alternating with Bruce McCandles on the newscast.
072:39:00|PAO|That was Fred Haise alternating with Bruce McCandless on that news cast.
072:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours, 45 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 8188 nautical miles from the Moon approaching at a velocity of 4324 feet per second.
072:49:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong with the readback of the lunar orbit insertion burn number 1 pad. The ignition time for that burn 75 hours 49 minutes 49 seconds. That's 2 hours 57 minutes 49 seconds from this time. Duration of that burn 6 minutes 2 seconds, retrograde and the change in velocity 2917.3 feet per second. The expected orbit
072:49:00|PAO|following that maneuver is 169.2 by 62 nautical miles. To repeat the LOS AOS times we will lose signal with Apollo 11 at 75 hours 41 minutes 23 seconds as it goes behind the Moon. Given a successful lunar orbit insertion number 1 burn we will acquire the signal at 76 hours 15 minutes 29 seconds. If for some reason Apollo 11 can not perform the burn we will acquire the spacecraft at 76 hours 5 minutes 30 seconds.
072:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours, 6 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now 7331 nautical miles. Velocity is 4399 feet per second. The ignition time passed up to the crew on this pad is 4 minutes, 39 seconds earlier than the LOI 1 time published in the flight plan prior to liftoff. This means that all lunar events will move forward from the published flight plan time by this amount of time - 4 minutes, 39 seconds. This time will be made up during the transEarth coast, and splash should occur at the flight plan time. This is Mission Control, Houston.
073:10:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
073:10:00|PAO|The MOCR is the mission operations control room. That's the Control Center here.
073:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours, 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is 6522 nautical miles away from the Moon approaching at a velocity of 4483 feet per second.
073:55:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin with the read back of that information which was for contingency transEarth injection burns if required shortly after lunar orbit insertion.
073:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 8 minutes. Apollo 11 is 4,625 nautical miles away from the Moon. Velocity 4,765 feet per second. We're 1 hour 32 minutes away from loss of signal as Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon, and we're about 1 hour 41 minutes away from the LOI number 1 burn.
074:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 32 minutes. Apollo 11 is traveling at a velocity of 3- stand by. We've got a static display here.
074:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours into the mission. Apollo 11 is 2241 nautical miles away from the Moon. Velocity 5512 feet per second. We're 41 minutes away from loss of signal as 11 goes behind the Moon. We're 49 minutes away from the lunar orbit insertion maneuver number 1.
075:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 15 minutes into the mission. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now is 1516 nautical miles. Velocity 5981 feet per second.
075:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours 26 minutes. We're 15 minutes away from loss of signal. Apollo 11 is 9066 miles from the Moon, velocity 6511 feet per second. We're 23 minutes away from the LOI burn.
075:26:00|PAO|Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth polling flight controllers for the GO/NO-GO status for LOI now.
075:26:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin confirming the GO.
075:26:00|PAO|We are 3 minutes away from loss of signal. Apollo 11 is 425 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 7368 feet per second, weight 96,012 pounds.
075:26:00|PAO|And we've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon. We were showing a distance to the Moon of 309 nautical miles at LOS, velocity 7664 feet per second. Weight was 96,012 pounds. We're 7 minutes 45 seconds away from the LOI number 1 burn, which will take place behind the Moon out of communications. Here in the Control Center 2 members of the backup crew, Bill Anders and Jim Lovell, have joined Bruce McCandless at the CAPCOM console. Fred Haise, the third member of the backup crew, has just come in, too, and Deke Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations, is at that console. The viewing room is filling up. Among those we noticed on the front row in the viewing room are Astronauts Tom Stafford, John Glenn, Gene Cernan, Dave Scott, Al Worden, and Jack Swigert. With a good lunar orbit insertion burn the Madrid station should acquire Apollo 11 at 76 hours 15 minutes 29 seconds. Acquisition time for no burn 76 hours 05 minutes 30 seconds.
075:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 49 minutes. Apollo 11 should have started this long burn duration 6 minutes, 2 seconds, DELTA V 2917 feet per second. Given that burn we expect an orbit of 61 by 169.2 nautical miles. We're 24 and one-half minutes away from acquisition of signal with a good burn. The clock has not yet started counting for the other acquisition time. We'll take this lying down now and come back just prior to the acquisition in time for no burn. This is Mission Control, Houston.
076:04:00|PAO|- and we'll stand by.
076:04:00|PAO|We are passed the burn acquisition now and we have received no signal.
076:04:00|PAO|It's very quiet here in the control room. Most of the controllers seated at their consoles, a few standing up, but very quiet.
076:07:00|PAO|We're 7 minutes from acquisition time.
076:07:00|PAO|If Apollo 11 achieved only a partial burn, we could receive a signal any time so we will continue to stay up until acquisition time of 76 hours, 15 minutes, 29 seconds. That time is the initial acquisition time, but it could take a little longer to lock onto the signal for voice communications. We are 4 minutes away now.
076:07:00|PAO|There are a few conversations taking place here in the control room, but not very many. Most of the people are waiting quietly, watching and listening. Not talking.
076:07:00|PAO|That noise is just bring up the system. We have not acquired a signal. We're a minute and one-half away from acquisition time.
076:07:00|PAO|30 seconds.
076:07:00|PAO|Madrid AOS, Madrid AOS.
076:07:00|PAO|Telemetry indicates that the crew is working on the antenna angles to bring the high gain antenna to bear.
076:07:00|PAO|That burn report was by Neil Armstrong.
076:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're showing spacecraft weight in lunar orbit of 72,004 pounds.
076:23:00|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.
076:39:00|PAO|And again, that was Neil Armstrong with the report.
076:59:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin discussing the Earth shine.
077:14:00|PAO|Apollo 11 will be in acquisition for another 20 minutes during its first revolution of the Moon.
077:34:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal from Apollo 11 on its first lunar revolution. We will acquire the spacecraft on the next revolution at 78 hours 23 minutes 31 seconds. The orbital period for Apollo 11's present orbit 2 hours 8 minutes 37 seconds, and as you heard we passed up to the crew information that we would perform the LOI 2 burn using only bank A. The banks are the drive mechanisms for the ball values in the service propulsion system. They open and close these ball valves. The valves allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the engine. There are redundant valves and redundant banks, banks A and B. There was apparently - they are driven by nitrogen and that was the reference to the pressure drop there. It was apparently a leak in nitrogen tank B during the LOI 1 burn. This burn was performed with both banks open. The engine can be operated with only bank. It's apparent that the tank leaked only during the burn while the bank was actuated. Pressure has held steady since the end of the burn and the experts are reducing the data and looking at the leak rate, determining whether it was constant throughout the burn, precisely what the situation is. We're showing pressure in tank B of 1960 psi. In tank A 2250 psi. Both of these are well above the red lines of 400 pounds psi.
077:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 77 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Here in Mission Control Center, Houston we're at the process of changing shifts. Cliff Charlesworth's green team of flight controllers very shortly will be leaving their consoles. Meanwhile Apollo 11 is passing over the far side of the Moon out of acquisition. Our last orbital parameter readings on our flight dynamics orbital digital displays indicated an apolune of 168.5 nautical miles, a perilune of 1 - correction, a perilune of 61.2 nautical miles. We're currently planning a change of shift briefing at approximately 2:30 central daylight time or soon thereafter as practicable. The change of shift briefing will include only our flight director, Cliff Charlesworth. It's expected to be of short duration since we will have a TV pass soon after the reacquisition of the spacecraft. At 77 hours, 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
078:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 78 hours, 18 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 still passing around the far side of the Moon. We are less than 5 minutes now away from time of acquisition on this second revolution for Apollo 11. The station to acquire on this pass will be the Goldstone wing site which will feed the television to Mission Control Center in Houston, and thence to all parts of the country. We would expect to come up with television perhaps some several minutes after acquisition since we must first lock up on the downlink and have the scan converter in full operation. So at 78 hours, 19 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
078:18:00|PAO|Mark 2 minutes now from time of predicted acquisition in Mission Control Center. We are standing by.
078:18:00|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of predicted acquisition. Continuing to stand by in Mission Control Centerin Houston.
078:18:00|PAO|Mark 10 seconds away now. Standing by for acquisition. We've had AOS by Goldstone. Television is now on. That is Bruce McCandless -
078:18:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin making a report, a geological report on that site pass.
078:28:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins making that report.
078:28:00|PAO|That exchange between Capcom Bruce McCandless and Mike Collins aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft.
078:28:00|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We acquired TV at 78 hours, 24 minutes, 11 seconds. Currently our orbital parameters show 104. Altitude an apolune of 170.2, a perilune of 61.3 - nautical miles, those are.
078:28:00|PAO|We've now heard from all three Apollo 11 crew members during this television pass. The individual talking earlier was Neil Armstrong.
078:38:00|PAO|We have been some 17 minutes now into this television pass and standing by continuing to monitor.
078:48:00|PAO|We're now some 25 minutes into our television pass.
078:48:00|PAO|Watching this pass with a great deal of interest here in mission Control Center is Pete Conrad, the commander for the Apollo 12 mission.
078:48:00|PAO|There you have it. Our first glimpse of the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission. The eleven crew took us on a guided tour of the front side, plus talked their way through the power descent that lies ahead in tomorrows activities. At 78 hours 58 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor.
078:58:00|PAO|Apollo 11. This is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing the monitor.
079:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 9 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We currently read an apolune of 170.2 nautical miles a perilune of 61.2 nautical miles. Those listing of figures that you heard passed up to the crew were maneuver pad updates. The first group for LOI2. We're now looking at the time of burn of 80 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, which should revise our orbital parameters to 65.7 nautical miles by 53.7 nautical miles. A Delta-V of 159.2 feet per second, and a burn duration of 17 seconds, some 17 seconds. So at 79 hours 9 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 79 hours 18 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. A quiet period at this time, as the Apollo 11 spacecraft continues its pass around the front side of the Moon. Our current altitude, very close to apolune, now reading 166.7 nautical miles. Our orbital parameter is 170.2 by 61.2 nautical miles. Current spacecraft weight in orbit, 71,622 pounds. We'll continue to keep the line up and continue to monitor the Apollo 11 crew. No doubt, at this time, preoccupied very probably with the alignment of their G&N platform. At 79 hour and 19 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 79 hours, 25 minutes. That maneuver pad that was transmitted to the crew - that was TEI, or transEarth injection burn for the fourth revolution, is a contingency pad only to assure that it is properly onboard the spacecraft, if any unlikely event it should become necessary to return. At the present time we read an altitude of 157.7 nautical miles descending from apolune at this time. And our orbital parameters read 170.2 nautical miles, 61.2 nautical miles. We're some 23 minutes away at the present time from loss of signal. At 79 hours, 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're some 14 minutes away now from loss of signal with the command and Service Module of Apollo 11. At 79 hours, 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston, standing by.
079:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 79 hours, 38 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 now 130.4 nautical miles in altitude. Current velocity reading of 5131 feet per second. Orbital parameters: apolune 170,2 nautical miles with a perilune reading 61.3 nautical miles.
079:23:00|PAO|Apollo 11, at this time, has completed it's platform alignment and is maneuvering the spacecraft to its burn attitude.
079:38:00|PAO|3 nautical miles. Apollo 11, at this time, has completed its platform alignment and is maneuvering the spacecraft to its burn attitude. We are some 33 minutes away, now, from time of ignition for the lunar orbit insertion number 2 burn, and we're 9 minutes 40 seconds away from loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. So at 79 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:38:00|PAO|Mark, 30 minutes - 30 seconds now from predicted time of loss of signal. Standing by. 10 seconds. Apollo 11 should now be passing out of range.
079:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We are some 20 minutes away, at this time, of ignition for lunar orbit insertion burn number 2. This - the fine tune second burn in the series of two as we have inserted into lunar orbit. For LOI2, the Apollo 11 will be heads down. The burn will be initiated near perilune as the spacecraft passes over the far side of the Moon. Retrograde, like LOI1, but unlike Apollo's 8 and 10. The burn will not be targeted to place a spacecraft into a precise circular orbit. Taking what was learned on Apollo 10, this LOI2 burn is designed to take into account predicted perturbations and gradually circularize itself. The numbers that we're looking at for LOI2, that would be time of ignition, 80 hours 11 minutes 36 Seconds, which should change our orbital parameters, giving us an apolune of 65.7 nautical miles and a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. The Delta-V intended for this burn, 159.2 feet per second. Burn duration anticipated 17 seconds. That's a burn of short duration, but certainly important in that it establishes the proper orbital parameters for the events that lie ahead. As you heard in earlier conversation,
079:38:00|PAO|between our capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless and crew members aboard the spacecraft. We're GO for LOI 2. During this burn, we'll utilize only the bank A ball valve. The bank referred to here, which there are two mechanisms that drive the ball valves open and shut, causing fuel and oxidizer to mix for ignition. At the present time in Mission Control Center, the last reference you've heard from our capsule communicator reflects that they, on their own peculiar shift schedule, are having a change of shift. Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene and we can assume will take over the responsibilities of the conversational flow with the Apollo 11 spacecraft, once we reacquire. At 79 hours 55 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:10:00|PAO|Mark 1 minute until planned time of ignition for LOI 02. Mike Collins will be at the controls for the Lunar Orbit Insertion 02 burn just as he was far LOI 01. The burn is of short duration as we have indicated earlier, some 17 seconds of burn time anticipated. We're standing by in Mission Control Center relatively quiet. Mark 30 seconds. Continuing to monitor - or read those displays that gave us our final readout prior to our passage to the backside of the Moon. Mark 10 seconds. Mark 05 seconds. We won't know for sure how the burn comes out until we acquire. Mark, plan time for ignition. At 80 hours 12 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:31:00|PAO|Mark 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. During this up coming pass, we will have our second excursion on the part of the Apollo 11 crew into - into the Lunar Module. The LM is to be pressurized by a valve in a tunnel hatch and as a point of interest, will remain pressurized following of this period of activation and after the members of the Apollo crew return to the Command Module. For this period of activation, it's definitely planned that - Buzz will go into the LM and there is a distinct possibility that Commander Neil Armstrong could - could exercise his option and go into the LM. Our station to acquire as we come around the far side of the Moon will be Goldstone. Mark 1 minute from predicted time of acquisition and we're standing by.
080:31:00|PAO|Mark 30 seconds.
080:31:00|PAO|Mark 10 seconds from predicted time of acquisition.
080:31:00|PAO|Goldstone has acquired Apollo 11.
080:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, standing by at this time at 80 hours 35 minutes.
080:31:00|PAO|Both Goldstone and Hawaii have acquired a signal. We will -
080:31:00|PAO|You heard that report from Commander Neil Armstrong indicating that LOI 02 was all - came off almost precisely as planned.
080:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. You copied that report. We're standing by for Apollo 11 spacecraft to acquire on the high gain antenna. Meanwhile, on board readings on orbital parameters were 66.1 nautical miles by 54.4 nautical miles, very close to the planned altitudes that were predicted prior to the LOI 2 burn. At 80 hours 46 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston 80 hours 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Very preliminary ground readings indicate an apolune of 65.6, perilune 53.7.
080:41:00|PAO|That - -
080:52:00|PAO|That was passed up to Mike Collins, the Command Module pilot, who will occupy himself during this pass on the over the front side with landmark tracking activities. At 80 hours, 53 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, we continue to monitor.
080:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 80 hours, 56 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current velocity reading 5334 feet per second. Current weight of the spacecraft in orbit, 75,505 pounds.
080:52:00|PAO|That was Commander Neil Armstrong talking to our Capsule Communicator Charles Duke. Our current orbital readings show an apolune of 65.5, a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. At 80 hours, 58 minutes into the flight, we continue to monitor, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours into the flight of Apollo 11, a period of relative quiet. No doubt the Apollo 11 crew quite preoccupied in operation for the activation of the LM. During this period of relative quiet, we'll pass along the heart rates from the LOI1 burn, that's LOI1, not LOI2. We have yet to receive those numbers. The heart rate for the Commander Neil Armstrong read 106, for Command Module Pilot Mike Collins, 66, and for the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin we have a reading of 70. At 81 hours, 1 minute into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:02:00|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. At 81 hours 5 minutes into the flight. Still a period of relative quiet. Our ground readings indicate that the Apollo 11 spacecraft has completed its program of 52, that's to align the inertial platform. Indications from the ground are that it - this activity went very well. And at 81 hours 6 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 15 minutes. It's been an extremely quiet pass. No doubt, the Apollo 11 crew, quite busy at this time. We expect, at the time entry is made into the Lunar Module, Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, will be out of acquisition, traversing over the far side of the Moon. At the present time, we read an altitude, current altitude, reading of 56.7 nautical miles. Our ground displays indicate an apolune of 65.4, a perilune of 53.8 and spacecraft velocity of 5,364 feet per second. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 16 minutes into the flight.
081:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 81 hours 24 minutes now into the flight. The silence of conversation between Mission Control Center, Houston and the crew has broken there moments ago. Charlie Duke called up Apollo 11 and spoke with Neil Armstrong, who indicated that the hatch was out and the probe and drogue removed and they were about ready to open the Lunar Module hatch. Our current altitude shows 54.7 nautical miles, apolune, 65.4, perilune, 53.8. Interestingly enough, the part of the LM activation which we will follow up most closely will be at time of reacquisition following our pass over the far side of the Moon. This will be on the front side. It will afford us an opportunity for a communications check with the Lunar Module and there will be a transfer to LM power. At 81 hours 25 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:02:00|PAO|You heard that report from Neil Armstrong. They are now in the Lunar Module.
081:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 81 hours 30 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 Commander and Lunar Modules pilots appear to be a little bit ahead on their timelines in the LM activation period. Meanwhile, Command Module pilot Mike Collins proceeding further with his land mark tracking exercises. Mike also reported a little puddle of water inside the Command Module near the aft bulkhead his reference to like 101 referred to the Apollo 7 spacecraft, which was commanded by Walter Schirra. Our current altitude 54 nautical miles, current apolune 65.4, our current perilune 53.8. We now show a weight in orbit of 70,472 pounds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor at 81 hours 32 minutes into the flight.
081:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We are now some five minutes away from loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We currently show an altitude of 54.2 nautical miles, apolune 65.4, perilune 53.9 nautical miles. Flight Director Milt Windler now talking with various members of his flight control team. We would expect a final bit of conversation prior to loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We'll keep our line up and continue to monitor conversations that could transpire prior to loss of signal. Standing by at 81 hours 41 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.
081:41:00|PAO|Mark 3 minutes now from predicted time of loss of signal.
081:41:00|PAO|Mark 2 minutes now from time of LOS.
081:41:00|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of LOS.
081:41:00|PAO|We've now had loss of signal with Apollo 11. At 81 hours, 45 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:30:00|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're now within 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. As we make this pass - near side pass, on the fourth revolution, it will be the first time that we have transferred during this mission to Lunar Module Pilot power, and a communications check will be performed on the Lunar Module. We should be hearing such things as long counts being given from the spacecraft. Additionally, a new display - the lunar landing site display is now up for the first time in Mission Control Center this flight. It's essentially a blowup for the landing sites 1 and 2. We expect it to stay up through the time of lunar landing. Meanwhile a Mission Control Center Flight Director, Milt Windler, beginning to discuss with members of his Flight Control team items that might be expected after we acquire. We're less than a minute away at this time - at this time from our forecast acquisition. We'll stand by.
082:30:00|PAO|Standing by now for acquisition.
082:30:00|PAO|We have acquisition. We are receiving the telemetry data at this time. Hawaii and Goldstone have both acquired.
082:30:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins indicating he would be doing the allude - additional landmark tracking, and we shall hear further from him shortly.
082:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 82 hours, 38 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Well, we have single contact with Apollo 11 thus far this pass, when Mike Collins identified he was still involved with program 22, the auto optics landmark tracking activity. We expect additional conversation as the pass transpires. Presently we're reading on our orbit displays an altitude of 65.1 nautical miles, apolune 65.3 nautical miles, perilune of 54 nautical miles. We currently show a velocity on the Apollo 11 spacecraft of 5318 feet per second - 5318 feet per second. At 82 hours, 39 minutes, and continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 82 hours 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. our air-to-ground sounding somewhat noisy, this being because we're utilizing the omni antenna for downlink. This, a requirement because of the attitude required for landmark tracking for program 22. At 82 hours 48 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
082:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 82 hours 55 minutes. Our current spacecraft altitude 62.1 nautical miles. Our orbital parameter is essentially the same at 65.3, 53.9. So at 82 hours 55 minutes, we continue to monitor and this Apollo Control Houston.
082:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. That was a report from the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin. He could see the entire landing area out the window. At 82 hours 58 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
082:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 83 hours 2 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Currently we show an apolune of 65.3 nautical miles, a perilune of 53.9. We would expect the transfer to Lunar Module power to occur momentarily and from that point on the communications check with the Lunar Module. 83 hours 3 minutes and standing by, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 83 hours 7 minutes now into the flight. We're now receiving data from the Lunar Module on our displays here in Mission Control Center.
083:05:00|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin from the Lunar Module using the codename for the first time.
083:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. A voice count exchange between Buzz Aldrin and the Eagle, the Lunar Module and Charles Duke here in Mission Control Center.
083:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. Our communications check out with the Eagle apparently going very well at this time.
083:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours, 21 minutes are now in to the flight. Meanwhile, aboard the Eagle, apparently Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, although Buzz is doing most of the comm check at this time.
083:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours and 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. That last exchange between Charlie Duke, our capsule communicator and Buzz Aldrin, aboard the Eagle, identifying that we're very well satisfied with the communications check on the Lunar Module and will proceed with powering down the spacecraft. At 83 hours 27 minutes, we now read an altitude of 54.3 nautical miles, a velocity of 5,376 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:25:00|PAO|That was Mike Collins, aboard Columbia, taking down a maneuver pad.
083:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours 34 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Lunar Module communications has been deactivated. We currently show a velocity of 5,377 feet per second. Our orbital parameters now read 65.1 nautical miles.
083:35:00|PAO|We currently show a velocity of 53 hundred and 77 feet per second. Our orbital parameters now read 65.1 nautical miles epilune, 54.2 nautical miles perilune. At 83 hours 35 minutes continuing to follow, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 83 hours 38 minutes. Apollo 11 now on CSM power.
083:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 83 hours 40 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We're less than 4 minutes away now from time of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. At the present time, our velocity reading, 53 hundred and 75 feet per second. Our total weight in orbit at this time, reading 70 thousand 500 and 2 pounds. Our orbital parameter's epilune is 65.1 nautical miles perilune 54.2 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 83 hours 43 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Less than a minute away from predicted time of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We expect the next time we acquire Apollo 11, it's crew, Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, will have begun their rest period. And at 83 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
083:44:00|PAO|Apollo 11 has passed out of range with the ground, traversing now over the far side of the Moon. During this pass, we had an extremely successful communications checkout with the Lunar Module using its code name for the first time. Its code name of the Eagle. Buzz Aldrin performed the counting tasks in concert with Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator here on the ground, and at times Buzz's - Buzz's voice, we noted considerable enthusiasm for the way things are going, and at times Charlie Duke shared that enthusiasm and its maiden checkout in communications, the Lunar Module Eagle, looked good. At 83 hours 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 84 hours and 28 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We're less than 2 minutes away now from our scheduled time of acquisition with Apollo 11. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center, Astronaut Owen Garriott has now replaced Charlie Duke as our Capsule Communicator. We expect that some final advisories will be passed to the Apollo 11 crew, and final report says such as crew status will be received from Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin prior to the start of their sleep period. A little over - we're a little over a minute away now from scheduled time of acquisition. We'll continue to keep the line up and continue to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:28:00|PAO|Mark 30 seconds now from time of scheduled acquisition.
084:28:00|PAO|Mark 20 seconds. 10 seconds. We should be acquiring shortly and we're standing by.
084:28:00|PAO|We have data - we've acquired data on Apollo 11.
084:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. Owen Garriott getting ready to place a call.
084:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours 39 minutes now into the flight. That conversational exchange with Owen Garriott - here in Mission Control Center and principally Buzz Aldrin; however, Mike Collins did talk briefly about Program 22, the landmark tracking activity in which he performed. At 84 hours 40 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours 44 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current spacecraft altitude is now 64.3 nautical miles with an apolune 65.2 nautical miles; perilune 54.4 nautical miles. We show an orbital period of one hour 58 minutes 40 seconds on our displays. Current weight of the spacecraft in orbit 70,502 pounds. At 84 hours 44 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight. We're receiving noisy data at this time. We've requested Apollo 11 to give us a manual relock. Standing by at 84 hours, 49 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 56 minutes are now in the flight of Apollo 11. Our current apolune 65.1 nautical miles, current perilune 54.3 nautical miles. After receiving some noisy signal, Apollo 11 has locked back on in fine form. That was Buzz Aldrin speaking with Owen Garriott here in the Mission Control Center. I expect we will take a second look at why we had to lock on manually. As we receive any updates on this, we'll pass them along. We now read 84 hours, 57 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
084:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 85 hours 5 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We confirmed from the ground, following that conversation exchange. As was pointed out -
084:58:00|PAO|As was pointed out, quad, RCS quad Charlie is now disabled following that conversational exchange between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin. Buzz, the Lunar Module Pilot apparently, quite obviously still awake. 85 hours 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11 now continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:13:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 85 hours 17 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. What you heard in the conversation between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin was following a communications check in which we secured the uplink carrier for some 30 seconds and waited to give it a period of time of approximately 3 minutes, to see if the spacecraft would reacquire. We appeared to reacquire in fine form on this first test. We will repeat it - this test a second time, delaying approximately 4 minutes before we place a call to Apollo 11. At 85 hours 17 minutes, we currently read an altitude - spacecraft altitude of 56.1 nautical miles. Present velocity shows 5,367 feet per second. At apolune 65 nautical miles, perilune 54.4 nautical miles. Present weight in orbit remains a static 70,502 pounds. Present time in orbit as shown on our displays, 1 hour 58 minute 40 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've run 2 tests thus far with the S-band antenna which has reacquired nicely on both occasions. While we are standing by for further possible conversations with the crew at this time, we' re some 50 minutes from predicted time of loss of signal on Apollo 11. Currently we read an apolune of 65 nautical miles - a perilune of 54.4 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 29 minutes now into the flight. That was Mike Collins reporting to the capsule communicator Owen Garriott that the Apollo 11 crew completing dinner at this time. And earlier perhaps if you listened to the air/ground, you heard some music in the background, soft music which would indicate that the this was being played in concert with their evening meal. When we reacquire, we expect one of the three crew members to still be, at least one to be still awake as we run a further check on our spacecraft antenna. At 85 hours 30 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston.
085:33:00|PAO|85 hours 40 minutes at this time. That - perhaps the last conversation we'll have with Apollo 11 until we reacquire. We're now 1 minute, 20 seconds away from loss of signal, continuing to stand by. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours, 41 minutes.
085:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We've had loss of signal as the Apollo 11 spacecraft begins its pass around the far side of the Moon at 85 hours, 42 minutes.
086:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're now less than 2 minutes away from acquisition of signal on Apollo 11 and in Mission Control Center, Houston, we're standing by. Mark 1 minute from predicted acquisition of signal. We should be acquiring. We're standing by.
086:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 86 hours, 33 minutes. You heard that last exchange. The Mission Control Center has isolated our earlier loss of lock on with the S-Band antenna to a faulty power supply to Goldstone which in turn introduced noisy data causing a ground based receiver to go out of lock. This power supply, a 24 volt one, has already been replaced at Goldstone. In summary, the spacecraft looks good and the difficulty was caused here on the ground. At 86 hours, 34 minutes, we now read our orbit at 64.9 nautical miles apolune, 54.6 nautical miles perilune. This is Apollo Control, Houston. This is Apollo Control, Houston at 86 hours, 52 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current altitude on the Apollo 11 spacecraft now reads 64.9 nautical miles. This corresponds with our apolune of 64.9 nautical miles. Our perilune on this pass 54.6 nautical miles. We've had no further conversation with the Apollo 11 crew nor do we expect to do so. We will take the loop down at this time and stand by if any further conversation should develop. At 86 hours, 53 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
087:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 87 hours, 31 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 spacecraft continues on it's front side pass above the Moon. We're now less than 10 minutes away from loss of signal. The Apollo 11 crew in - currently in their rest period. We've received no indication yet that any of the crew members are actually sleeping, although all three appear to be in a very restful mode. This will be the final sleep period for the crew. Now at the threshold of their prime mission objective for the final sleep period prior to landing on the lunar surface and returning. The next scheduled rest period will in fact take place on the surface of the Moon. We are now past mid night Central Daylight Time. It is now July 20., the day scheduled for lunar landing. Our current orbital parameters read apolune 67. - correction 64.7 nautical miles, perilune 54.8 nautical miles.., Current spacecraft altitude 54.8 nautical miles. Our time of orbit or little period remains the same 1 hour, 58 minutes, 40 seconds. So at 87 hours, 30 minutes, we will continue to stand by in the event that we have any conversation with the crew. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
087:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo control Houston at 87 hours, 40 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 now less than a minute away from loss of signal as it is due to pass over the far side of the Moon and out of range with the mission Control Center as well as the rest of the world. We've had no further conversations with the crew. All spacecraft systems appear in fine shape. We're now less then 30 seconds away from time of loss of signal and standing by. Mark 10 seconds. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 passes over the back of the Moon.
089:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 89 hours 38 minutes ground Elapsed Time. Coming down - actually, we've had loss of signal on this the seventh lunar revolution of Apollo 11. Should have acquisition again at 90 hours 25 minutes through the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station. The crew has been asleep about 2 hours, a little over 2 hours when the third man finally went to sleep, Mike Collins, after a brief interchange with the Ground. And 3 hours 57 minutes remaining in the sleep period. Cabin pressure now holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch at a temperature of 69 degrees Fahrenheit. Crew heart rates are running in the 40's. Apollo 11 presently in a lunar orbit with a pericynthion of 55 nautical miles, apocynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. Velocity in lunar orbit, 5363 feet per second. Some 44 minutes 46 seconds until acquisition of signal, as the spacecraft comes around from the far side of the Moon on the eighth revolution. And at 89 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
091:36:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 91 hours, 36 minutes ground elapsed time. Less than 1 minute remaining until loss of signal with Apollo 11 as it goes onto the lunar far side in the eighth lunar revolution. Two hours remaining in the crew rest period which means that midway through the next front side pass the crew will be wakened if they're indeed not already awake. Flight Surgeon, Ken Beers, reported just prior to the LOS in a brief exchange here in Mission Control that the crew apparently were all asleep soundly at this time and the Flight Director, Glynn Lunney, asked the spacecraft systems engineers how the spacecraft looked as they approached the LOS point. Coming up on LOS now, mark loss of signal. The spacecraft systems were described by the systems engineers as being looking good. 45 minutes to next - 45 minutes, 28 seconds to next acquisition of signal which will be in ground elapse time 92:23. 92 hours, 23 minutes ground elapse time. And at 91 hours, 37 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
093:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 93 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 5 minutes away from loss of signal of the Apollo 11 on this revolution. And a wake-up call is expected from the spacecraft communicator Ron Evans here in mission control just prior to the time the spacecraft goes into the - goes over the hill on the lunar far side. Standing by as we wait for him to make his call. Presently, Apollo 11 is in an orbit measuring 64 nautical miles apocynthion, 55.5 nautical miles at pericynthion. Present orbital Velocity around the Moon, 5370 feet per second. Spacecraft calculated now to weight 70,321 pounds. Still standing by for wake-up call. Standing by for Ron Evans big moment as he makes his call to the spacecraft. As being the sleep watch, his job has been rather easy or at least he hasn't had too much conversation with - here we go.
093:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo control. We have had loss of signal from Apollo 11 as it went over the hill. Now tracking through the Madrid station during this series of revolutions. Next acquisition as Apollo 11 comes back around the east limb of the Moon and the next revolution will be at 94 hours, 21 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 43 minutes now, and at 93 hours, 36 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
094:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 94 hours, 21 minutes ground elapse time. Should have acquisition of signal as Apollo 11 comes around on the front side of the Moon on the 10th revolution. AOS is confirmed. We'll stand by Capcom's call to the crew. We have data coming in now. After having breakfast and getting all squared away after the night's rest period, the crew will have a rather busy day including the first man landing on the Moon. Some of the preliminary time's being generated now for maneuvers of the day - will include separation at - a separation burn at 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds. Here goes the call.
094:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control following the separation burn at the time of 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds. The descent orbit insertion burn is now scheduled at 101 hours, 36 minutes, 13.5 seconds. Our descent initiation at 102 hours, 32 minutes, 05.1 seconds. We'll stay up live on the air-ground loop, and continue to monitor any further conversation between spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans, here in mission control and the crew of Apollo 11, which at this time is likely in the middle of their breakfast period.
094:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control still standing by as the Apollo 11 - about a third of the way through the front side pass on revolution number 10. Still in the midst of their breakfast period. Various console positions are preparing numbers for maneuver times, attitudes, and so on for the day's activities to pass to spacecraft communicator who in turn will pass them up to the crew. Probably during this pass - members of the white team of flight controllers headed up by Eugene Kranz are drifting into the control room now to relieve the night watch - black team headed by Glynn Lunney. Glynn Lunney will hold a brief change of shift press conference in the Apollo news center in MSC after the handover is complete. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit for any further transmissions from Apollo 11.
094:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still F line with the air-ground circuit on the tenth revolution around the Moon. The crew reported that the commander had 5 and a half hours of sleep during the night, Command Module pilot, 6 hours, Lunar Module Pilot, 5 hours. Now 95 hours and 5 minutes into the mission. Another 27 minutes remaining in this pass. Still loss of signal continuing to monitor air-ground circuit. We'll leave it up live until loss of signal.
095:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 9 minutes 27 seconds remaining until loss of signal on this 10th revolution in lunar orbit. The crew is preparing, now that they've finished breakfast and gotten a lot of the other items out of the way such as the crew checklist and sleep status and so on, preparing for manning the LM for the second time and preparing for the day's activities which will culminate in landing this afternoon. Apollo 11 is presently in an orbit with a pericynthion of 55.7 nautical miles, apocynthion 63.8 nautical miles. Lunar orbit velocity 5368 feet per second. We'll continue to stand by on the air-ground circuit for the remaining 8 minutes of this revolution or until loss of signal. Ground elapsed time now is 95 hours 25 minutes, Apollo Control standing by.
095:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have apparently had loss of signal from the spacecraft. Here in Mission Control we are in the process of changing shifts. Flight Director Gene Kranz and the white team of flight controllers coming on to replace Flight Director Glenn Lunney. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. We'll reacquire the spacecraft again in a little over 45 minutes, coming up on the 11th revolution of the Moon. At 95 hours 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
095:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 38 minutes. There will be a change of shift briefing following this shift. We estimate the briefing will begin in about 10 or 15 minutes in the MSC
096:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 19 minutes. We are now less than 1 minute to reacquiring the spacecraft on the 11th revolution of the Moon. Flight Director Gene Kranz since taking over the shift has gone around the room, reviewed the situation with all of his flight controllers. We expect when we reacquire, Buzz Aldrin will be in the LM beginning the LM power up and check out. And he will be rejoined in a short while by Neil Armstrong. We'll stand by now for acquisition of signal as the spacecraft comes around the corner.
096:19:00|PAO|Network says we have acquired signal, we'll stand by for the call to the crew.
096:33:00|PAO|LM communications, engineer reports that we're on the LM steerable antenna. This apparently accounts for the quiet communications we're getting at this point.
096:43:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Armstrong is now in the Lunar Module, in Eagle, and the LM activation and checkout appears to be going along very well somewhat ahead of schedule.
096:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have about 33 minutes left in this pass before loss of signal. Neil Armstrong confirmed that the LM power switch occurred at 95 hours 54 minutes, which would have put that activity about 30 minutes ahead of the flight plan's schedule, and that appears to be about the pace that the crew is holding, that Armstrong and Aldrin are holding and getting the LM activated and checked out. At this time Buzz Aldrin has returned to the command and Service Module where he will be donning his pressure garment and then rejoin Armstrong in Eagle.
097:22:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. We'll next acquire the spacecraft in about 46 minutes at a ground elapse time of 98 hours, 18 minutes. During that pass, Armstrong and Aldrin in the Lunar Module begin checking out activating the Lunar Module, and they appeared to finish about 30 minutes ahead of the scheduled time in the flight plans. They began early and have maintained the pace. Both spacecraft looking very good at this time. Everything progressing very smoothly. On the next revolution, revolution 12, the crew will continue activation and checkout of Lunar Module systems. The following revolution, revolution 13, they will undock from the command and Service Module. At 97 hours, 33 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
098:16:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 16 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft in its 12th revolution of the Moon. At this time Armstrong and Aldrin should be completing pressure checks on their spacesuits. Coming up in this revolution, they will be running checks on the guidance platform of their LM guidance system. They will also be running checks on the Reaction Control System thrusters and their descent propulsion system, as well as the rendezvous radar. We will also be giving them the GO/NO GO for undocking in the following revolution. The checkout and activation up to this point has been moving along very smoothly. All systems performing well and we were ahead of the flight plan at the end of the last revolution. We will stand by now to reacquire the spacecraft. The LM and CSM are still docked and Armstrong and Aldrin within the LM. That will be their home for the next 30 hours or so. Now about 45 seconds from reacquiring. We are now about 15 seconds from reacquisition of Apollo 11. Spacecraft currently in an orbit with an apocynthion of 63 and one-half nautical miles and pericynthian of 55.9, as we are continuing to see the apocynthion drop and pericynthian raise as the orbit becomes more and more circular. We should have acquisition of signals shortly. We will have some noise on the circuits until the LM ,steerable and the CSM high gain antennas are brought into play. CAPCOM Charlie Duke putting in a call to the crew. We'll continue to stand by.
098:16:00|PAO|Charlie Duke asking the crew to verify in the LM that they are on their forward OMNI antenna. We are still awaiting lockup and a stronger signal. We will continue to have noise on the circuit until we get a stronger signal. We do have telemetry data from the spacecraft at this time.
098:26:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We'll continue to have rather noisy communications from the spacecraft until the orbital navigation is completed. Mike Collins is preparing
098:38:00|PAO|Mike Collins reporting that he has completed the marks for landmark tracking. We also got a report from the LM that they have deployed the landing gear, and that report came at 98 hours 45 minutes.
099:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have less than 10 minutes now until loss of signal on the twelfth revolution. Before losing contact with the spacecraft, we'll be passing along a GO-NO/GO decision for undocking. That will occur early on the next revolution just prior to reacquiring the spacecraft. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, is going around the Control Center talking to his flight controllers. We're viewing status in preparation for making the GO-NO/GO decision for undocking.
099:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. We'll reacquire the spacecraft again on the thirteenth revolution in about 45 minutes. At the
099:19:00|PAO|end of this pass, we passed along the GO for undocking. That maneuver will occur just before we reacquire the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution and will be followed in about 30 minutes later by a small separation maneuver performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module. Checkout of the LM has been going extremely well up to now ahead of schedule. Both vehicles look very good. At 99 hours, 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
100:14:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 14 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution. When next we hear from them the Lunar Module should be undocked from the command and Service Module. We're presently about 25 minutes away from the separation burn which will be performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module to give the LM and the CSM a separation distance after descent orbit insertion maneuver of about 2 miles. We have some times on the upcoming events. The separation maneuver is scheduled to occur at a ground elapsed time of 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds, the descent orbit insertion maneuver which will be performed on the backside of the Moon set for 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and the beginning of the powered descent at 102 hours, 33 minutes, 4 seconds. We're now 55 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the thirteenth revolution. During this revolution we will be doing the separation maneuver. We'll also be giving the crew on the Lunar Module a GO-NO/GO for the descent orbit insertion maneuver. We'll stand by now to reacquire the spacecraft. We have confirmation of acquisition of signal. We'll stand by for a call to the Crew.
100:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are now 6 minutes 8 seconds from ignition and -
100:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That separation was performed as scheduled. In the Command Module, a DELTA V of about 2.5 feet per second, which give a separation to the 2 vehicles of about 1100 feet at the beginning of the descent orbit insertion maneuver.
101:07:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're coming up on 15 minutes now until loss of signal with the Lunar Module. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has - has advised his flight controllers to review all their data, take a good close look at the spacecraft, and in preparation for a GO-NO/GO decision on the descent orbit insertion.
101:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now, and the spacecraft Eagle has been given a GO for descent orbit insertion. That maneuver to occur in 7 minutes 40 seconds. Out of contact - out of radio contact, the DOI maneuver scheduled to come at 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and it will be a 76.4 foot per second burn. The burn duration 29.8 seconds, and the resulting orbit for the LM will be 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles. When next we acquire the Lunar Module, it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles on its way down to a low point of about 50,000 feet from where the powered descent to the lunar surface will begin. As the spacecraft went around the corner, all systems on both vehicles looked very good. Everything is GO here in mission control and aboard the spacecraft for the descent orbit insertion to occur in 6 minutes, 38 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 101 hours 29 minutes.
101:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at lOl hours, 35 minutes. We're. now. less than one minute from the scheduled time for the descent orbit insertion maneuver performed by the Lunar Module on the backside of the Moon. Of course, we don't have radio contact with the spacecraft. In mission control here normally maneuvers of that sort would be monitored on plot boards in front, and we have the boards set up there for the powered descent. To occur about 1/2 rev from now over landing site 1. Flight controllers standing around in little groups. Not much that we can do at this point until reacquiring spacecraft. We're now 20 minutes - or 20 seconds rather from ignition on the descent orbit insertion. It will be a 29.8 second burn of the 9800-pound thrust descent propulsion system. We should be burning at this time. The result of this maneuver will be to put the spacecraft into an orbit 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles, and it would remain in that orbit until powered descent.
101:35:00|PAO|We should have a cut off by this time. That should have completed descent orbit insertion maneuver. We would expect to reacquire the Command Module first. Command Module acquisition time is 102 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. That will be just about 2 minutes prior to the time that we will have reacquired the Lunar Module. The LM acquisition time is 102 hours, 16 minutes, 25 seconds. That is about 37 minutes, 20 seconds from now on the CSM at about a little less than 2 minutes longer than that for the LM. At 101 hours, 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
101:54:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 101 hours, 54 minutes. We're now about 20 minutes, 45 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module on the 14th revolution. The time until the ignition for the power descent is 38 minutes, 55 seconds. Here in mission control, people still standing and waiting. I believe back in the viewing room, we probably have one of the largest assemblages of space officials that we've ever seen in one place. Included among the viewers are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Jim Elms, Director of the Electronic Research Center at Cambridge, Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of NASA's Lewis Research Center, Rocco Petrone, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center is there. From Marshall Space Center, we have Dr. Wernher von Braun, the Director, and his Deputy, Dr. Eberhard Rees. Also a large number of Astronauts including Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, Jim McDivitt, and John Glenn. We also see Dr. Kurt Debus, Director of the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Edgar Cortright, Director of the Langley Research Center. Dr. S. Draper, Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentations Laboratory is also in the viewing room. Here in the control room proper down on the floor a number of Astronauts including Pete Conrad, Fred Haise, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Sitting beside us in the back row of consoles here is Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. Further down on the line is General Sam Phillips, Director of the Apollo Program. Also Chris Kraft is here, Director of Flight Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center, and George Low of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. We also see in the back viewing room, Secretary of the Air Force, Seamans, and many others who I'm sure we can't see through the glass. We're now 18 minutes, 10 seconds until reacquisition of the spacecraft. Ignition for the power descent to the lunar surface is 36 minutes, 30 seconds away. At 101 hours, 57 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
102:12:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 102 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We're now 2 minutes 53 seconds from reacquiring the spacecraft, 21 minutes 23 seconds from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface. It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control. A few moments ago Flight Director Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and closed with a remark "Good luck to all of you". Here on the front of our display boards we have a number of big plot boards which will be used to keep track of the burn progress. Along the more important of those is one which will show the performance on onboard guidance systems, both the primary and the back up guidance system and compare the guidance systems with the Manned Space Flight Network tracking. These displays, by the time this is all over, will look a great deal like a combination Christmas tree and Fourth of July. We're now 1 minute 39 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module, Columbia. Acquisition of the Lunar Module will come a little less than 2 minutes after that. At the time we acquire the LM it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles descending toward the 50,000 foot pericynthion from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated. If for any reason the crew does not like the way things look as they are coming across the pericynthion, simply by not initiating the maneuver they will remain in a safe orbit of 60 miles by 50,000 feet, and if they desired they would be able to attempt the powered descent on the following revolution at a ground elapsed time of about 104 hours 26 minutes. We're now coming up on 30 seconds to acquisition of the Command Module and we'll stand by for that event.
102:12:00|PAO|Now work controller says we have acquisition of signal from the Command Module.
102:12:00|PAO|We have acquisition of signal from the LM.
102:12:00|PAO|We're attempting to restore antenna lock through the big 210 foot dish at Goldstone. We'll stand by.
102:12:00|PAO|Guidance says we're GO.
102:12:00|PAO|Now 12 minutes, 54 seconds to ignition. Gene Kranz just replied his flight controllers were off to a good start. Play it cool.
102:12:00|PAO|12 minutes now until ignition for powered descent. Everything still looking very good at this point.
102:12:00|PAO|We presently show the LM at an altitude of 12.9 nautical miles and descending.
102:12:00|PAO|Aldrin is referring to the LM steerable antenna. That comment about the oscillations.
102:12:00|PAO|Eagle is now at 10.7 nautical miles, 7 minutes 37 seconds from ignition.
102:12:00|PAO|Coming up on 5 minutes to ignition. Gene Kranz getting a GO/NO GO for. descent.
102:12:00|PAO|Buzz Aldrin reading off the checklist there to Neil Armstrong.
102:12:00|PAO|Coming up on 1 minute to ignition.
102:33:00|PAO|Current altitude about 46,000 feet, continuing to descend.
102:33:00|PAO|2 minutes, 20 seconds everything looking good. We show altitude about 47,000 feet.
102:38:00|PAO|Altitude 40,000.
102:38:00|PAO|Good radar data. Altitude now 33,500 feet.
102:38:00|PAO|We're still GO. Altitude 27,000 feet.
102:38:00|PAO|Altitude now 21 thousand feet. Still looking very good. Velocity down now to 12 hundred feet per second.
102:38:00|PAO|Seven minutes 30 seconds into the burn. Altitude 16 thousand 3 hundred feet.
102:38:00|PAO|Altitude 13 thousand 5, velocity 91 hundred feet per second.
102:38:00|PAO|Correction on that velocity, now reading 760 feet per second.
102:38:00|PAO|FIDO says we're go, altitude 92 hundred feet.
102:38:00|PAO|Descent rate 129 feet per second.
102:38:00|PAO|We're now in the approach phase of it, looking good. Altitude 52 hundred feet.
102:38:00|PAO|Altitude 42 hundred -
102:43:00|PAO|Altitude 4200.
102:43:00|PAO|Altitude 1600. 1400 feet. Still looking very good.
102:48:00|PAO|The next major stay, no stay will be for a T2 event, that is at 21 minutes 26 seconds after initiation for power descent.
102:48:00|PAO|We have an unofficial time for that touchdown of a 102 hours 45 minutes 42 seconds and we will update that.
102:48:00|PAO|We are now less than 4 minutes from our next stay, no stay. The stay will be for 1 complete revolution of the Command Module.
102:48:00|PAO|One of the first things that Armstrong and Aldrin will do after getting their next stay, no stay will be to remove their helmet and gloves.
102:48:00|PAO|That stay for another 2 minutes plus. The next stay no stay will be for 1 revolution.
102:53:00|PAO|steady for another 2 minutes plus, the next stay no stay, will be for 1 revolution. We don't expect much in the way of a visual description of the landing area from the crew until after we get through these critical stay, no stay periods and have gotten the status to remain on the lunar surface for at least 1 command and Service Module revolution. All spacecraft systems continue to look good to us here on the ground.
102:58:00|PAO|That last remark from Mike Collins at an altitude of 60 miles. The comments on the landing on the manual take-over came from Neil Armstrong. Buzz Aldrin followed that with a description of the lunar surface and the rocks and boulders that they are able to see out the window of the LM.
102:58:00|PAO|That request from Neil Armstrong.
102:58:00|PAO|Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the -
102:58:00|PAO|We have just gotten a report from the TEL COM here in Mission Control that the LM systems looked good after that landing. We're about 26 minutes now from loss of signal from the Command Module.
103:03:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong reporting there. No difficulty adapting to the one-sixth gravity of the Moon.
103:23:00|PAO|We would like to point out that the fuel pressure problem that had been called to the attention of the crew, is in the descent system and it is probably the downstream of the tanks where a small amount of fluid has been trapped in a line and we don't expect it to cause any problem. The line should be able to take far more pressure than the fluid would exert. In the event that there was an over-pressurization, we would expect that the line would spring a small leak, the pressure would drop rapidly. Again, we point out that we do not see this as a significant problem.
103:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal now from the Command Module and of course, we'll maintain constant communications with the Lunar Module on the lunar surface. We have some heart rates for Nell Armstrong during that power descent to the lunar surface. At the time the burn was initiated, Armstrong's heart rate was 110. At touchdown on the lunar surface, he had a heart rate of 156 beats her minute, and the flight surgeon reports that his heart rate is now in the 90's. We do not have biomedical on Buzz Aldrin.
103:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 32 minutes. We have an update on that touchdown time on the lunar surface. This still is not the final, official time which we will get from readout of data, but the refined time is 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds, which would have been 12 minutes 36 seconds after initiating the powered descent. That was 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds for touchdown and a total time of powered descent 12 minutes 36 seconds, and we would expect then those numbers to change perhaps a little when we get final data readouts.
103:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 44 minutes. There will be a brief statement from Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, in the building 1 auditorium at 4:30. We also have some updated information on the landing point. It appears that the spacecraft, Eagle, touched down at 799 degrees north, or just about on the lunar equator. And 23.46 degrees longitude, which would have put it about 4 miles from the targeted landing point downrange. We're now 54 minutes - rather 27 minutes from reacquisition of the Command Module, and of course, we're in constant contact with the Lunar Module on the surface. At this point, all LM systems seem to look very good.
103:54:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 57 minutes. We will be taking the release line down briefly for a statement from Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator. We will be recording further conversations with the spacecraft and will played those back following the statement. This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 58 minutes.
104:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 104 hours 10 minutes. We understand there's been a brief delay in the statement from NASA Administrator Thomas Pane. We will catch up with the tape recorded conversation that we have had with Eagle on the lunar surface, at this time.
104:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 104 hours, 31 minutes now into this historic mission, Apollo 11. During the news conference with NASA Administrator Dr. Thomas Paine, we had conversation with both Eagle and Columbia and we'll play that tape for you now.
104:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 104 hours 44 minutes. You heard that last exchange and there is a very strong indication we might have an early EVA with the hatch opened perhaps at 8:00 Houston time. One other item of significance that this the pressure rise in - depth descent propellant line downstage of the tanks has relieved all aspects of the mission, looking very good at this time. At 104 hours 45 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
104:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours now into the flight of Apollo 11. We expect a - our - our capsule communicator Owen Garriott to pass along data to spacecraft Columbia, momentarily. We're standing by for that. Meanwhile, I think we should discuss a little further the projected EVA. Our current plan is to have crew members above the Eagle to eat and relax for a little while prior to starting EVA preps. We won't know with certainty or have a reasonable time hack until about an hour before the scheduled event. Right it looks like it could occur at 8:00 Houston time. We have conversation going now with the spacecraft. We'll pick that up.
104:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We will shutdown the line at this time and turn to the news conference.
105:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 30 minutes on to the mission, Apollo 11. The spacecraft Columbia is now out of range with Mission Control Center, Houston, passing over the far side of the Moon. As it passed out of sight, we read an apolune of 63 nautical miles; a perilune of 56 nautical miles; a velocity of 5367 feet per second. We had conversation both with Tranquility base and Columbia during this span of time. Also, as will come up in that course of conversation. Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin delivers a message to people everywhere listening. We'll play those tapes for you now.
105:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 42 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. You have heard that statement in our tapes transmission from Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin. Our projected time for extravehicular activity, at this point, is still very preliminary. I repeat, it could come as soon as 8:00 p.m. Houston time. We won't know for sure about the time, with reasonable certainty until about an hour before the event. Meanwhile, as we'll soon be progressing toward man's first step on the lunar surface, we have an interesting phenomena here in the mission Control Center, Houston. Something we've never seen before. Our visual of the Lunar Module, our visual display now standing still. Our velocity digitals for Tranquility Base now reading zero. Reverting, if we could, to the terminology of an earlier form of transportation, the railroad. What we're witnessing now, is man's very first trip into space with a station stop along the route. At 105 hours 43 minutes, continuing to monitor the loop, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
105:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've only had one brief conversation over the past several minutes with Tranquility base. Capsule Communicator Owen Garriott asked when Tranquility base might start it's EVA prep, and Armstrong replied, about a half an hour or so. A normal time line for preparations for EVA would be approximately 2 hours. At 105 hours 52 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
105:50:00|PAO|Mark 1 minute now from time of acquisition on Columbia, now on it's 16th revolution around the Moon.
105:50:00|PAO|The capsule communicator you heard there is Bruce McCandless now on duty. Cliff Charlesworth's team of green flight controllers, by in large have returned to the
105:50:00|PAO|Control Center at this point. McCandless talked with both spacecraft and as you heard Neil Armstrong reporting from Tranquility Base, started that EVA preparations are now under way. At 106 hours 14 minutes now into the flight this is Apollo control Houston.
106:15:00|PAO|The reference there is to dosimeter readings from the commander and the Lunar Module Pilot. You noted the precision of Buzz Aldrin on that last reading. At 106 hours 24 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, continuing to stand by, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
106:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 15 minutes. We'll still have acquisition of Columbia for another 8 minutes. All systems in Eagle still looking good. Cabin pressure 4.86 pounds showing a temperature of 63 degrees in the Eagle's cabin.
106:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Our best information at this time on the orientation of Eagle that the plus Z axis, that's the leg with the ladder on it, is yaw 13 degrees south of the ground track. The sun behind Eagle with the - the leg with the ladder on it in a generally westly direction along the ground track, but yaw at 13 degrees south from that ground track.
106:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 23 minutes, and we've had loss of signal on Columbia. The clock here in the Control Center counting down to depressurization time on Eagle shows we're 36 minutes 39 seconds away from that event. We believe the crew is pretty well on the time line in EVA preparations. We will next acquire Columbia at 108 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds. Columbia's closest approach to Eagle on this next revolution will come at 108 hours 35 minutes 28 seconds when it should be 3 miles south of the track.
106:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Based on that checklist report from Eagle, the crew appears to be about behind the timeline in EVA preparations.
106:42:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 52 minutes. We're 16 minutes away from acquisition of Columbia on it's 17th revolution of the Moon. We do not at this time have a good estimate for the start of the EVA. We'll have to wait until Eagles crew, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin, give us some more information about how they're coming along in the preparations for the EVA. Indications are now that they are running on the order of 30 minutes behind the nominal time, preparations line. Maybe a little bit longer. But we'll have to wait until we hear from them again before we can get a good estimate on the time for starting the EVA.
108:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours, 2 minutes. This latest report that the crew is getting the electrical checkout indicates they're about 40 minutes behind the timeline. We will acquire Columbia in 6 minutes.
108:02:00|PAO|We have acquisition of Columbia.
108:02:00|PAO|Audio TECH coast to coast. VH A OFF, VH B OFF. I've got for you PTP COMMAND.
108:22:00|PAO|That was a Buzz Adrin's comment.
108:32:00|PAO|Cabin pressures on both vehicles reading 4.9 pounds per square inch. Columbia's temperature - 70 degrees F. Eagle's temperature 61 degrees F.
108:42:00|PAO|In the Control Center, a clock has been set to record the operating time on Neil Armstrong's portable life support system. EVA will be counted from that time.
109:03:00|PAO|Hatch reported coming open at 109 hours, 8 minutes, 05 seconds.
109:03:00|PAO|Correction - 109:07:35.
109:09:00|PAO|They've been on the PLSS now for 16 and 1/2 minutes.
109:09:00|PAO|We're 8 minutes away from loss of signal on Columbia.
109:09:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong's suit pressure 4. -
109:15:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong on the porch at 109 hours 19 minutes 16 seconds.
109:20:00|PAO|25 minutes of PLSS time expended now.
109:25:00|PAO|Unofficial time on the first step - 109:24:20.
109:25:00|PAO|The Surgeon says that -
109:25:00|PAO|The Surgeon says the crew is doing well. Data is good, crew is doing well.
109:30:00|PAO|35 and a half minutes of PLSS time expended now.
109:39:00|PAO|45 minutes PLSS time expended.
109:39:00|PAO|It's the sample return containers, the rock boxes that Capcom -
109:39:00|PAO|Both PLSS's nominal on consumables.
109:49:00|PAO|Biotite is a brown mica substance.
109:49:00|PAO|Life Support Consumables still looking good.
109:54:00|PAO|If you stand on the ladder facing forward, the minus Y strap is the landing gear to your left.
109:59:00|PAO|1 hour, 7 minutes time expended.
109:59:00|PAO|Buzz is erecting the solar wind experiment now.
110:04:00|PAO|All LM systems still looking good.
110:04:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong has been on the lunar surface now almost 45 minutes.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Neil Armstrong has the scoop for the bulk sample collection.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Neil's been on the surface a hour now. Buz not quite twenty minutes; less than that.
110:19:00|P|PAO|One hour and a half expended on the PLSS's now.
110:19:00|P|PAO|Heart rates on both crewmen have been averaging between 90 and 100. Flight surgeon reports they're right on the predicted number of the Btu units expended in energy of work. And he thinks they're in great shape.
110:29:00|PAO|You can Neil Armstrong bringing scoop - -
110:29:00|P|PAO|Neil is filling the bulk sample bag attached to a scale as seen in the picture. Buzz is behind the LM at the minus Z strut. That's the landing gear directly opposite the ladder. Neil's been on the surface about an hour and 10 minutes.
110:34:00|PAO|Buzz is making his way around the LM photographing it from various angles, looking at its condition on all sides. Neil still occupied with the bulk sample. 1 hour 40 minutes time expended on the PLSS's now.
110:39:00|PAO|Neil has finished collecting and packing the bulk sample.
110:44:00|PAO|Neil's been on the surface now slightly over an hour and 20 minutes.
110:49:00|PAO|The SEQ Bay contains the scientific experiments to be left on the surface of the Moon; the laser reflector.
110:49:00|PAO|The surgeon says everything looks fine.
110:54:00|PAO|An hour and a half of lunar surface time for Neil Armstrong.
110:54:00|PAO|They've been in the portable life support systems for 2 hours now.
110:54:00|PAO|That's Neil Armstrong to the left of the screen. That - -
110:54:00|PAO|Buzz Aldrin coming into view on the right carrying the two experiments.
110:54:00|PAO|And, they will be out of the cameras field of view while setting up these experiments.
110:59:00|PAO|- - while setting up these experiments.
111:04:00|PAO|The bubble they're discussing is on a leveling device on the passive seismometer.
111:04:00|PAO|Two twelve is the time expended on the PLSS.
111:09:00|PAO|Neil Armstrong has been on the surface now about an hour and fifty minutes. In the foreground Buzz Aldrin is collecting a core tube sample.
111:14:00|PAO|The core tubes provide material - -
111:14:00|PAO|That's Buzz Aldrin retrieving the solar wind experiment.
111:19:00|PAO|They've been on their life support systems 2 hours and 25 minutes. Neil appears to be picking up rocks to the right of the screen.
111:19:00|PAO|We want to keep a good margin in those portable life support systems.
111:19:00|PAO|That white dot, right above the horizon on the right is a phosphorus spot from the TV converter.
111:24:00|PAO|spot from the TV converter in the park station in Australia.
111:24:00|PAO|Neil's been on the surface a few minutes longer than two hours. Buzz, approximately 20 minutes less than that.
111:29:00|PAO|Transferring the sample containers into the LM cabin now.
111:29:00|PAO|The Lick Observatory in California reports a return on that lazer experiment.
111:34:00|PAO|Two hours and 40 minutes on the PLSS's.
111:34:00|PAO|Unofficial time off the surface at 111:37:32.
111:39:00|PAO|Cabin pressure coming up about 2. 789 pounds. Up to 3 now. 4 psi.
111:39:00|PAO|We assure the cabin at 4.8 now.
111:44:00|PAO|The LM's systems look good. Crewmen should now be transferring back to Tranquility Bases environmental control system and later we'll switch to the vehicles communications system. We estimate it will be another 10 to 15 minutes before their on the LM communication system.
111:49:00|PAO|And the replica of the American flag on the lunar surface is now being erected here in the Control Center. And a replica of the plaque on the Tranquility Base has been hung on the wall.
112:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Dr. Charles Berry reports that heart rates during this EVA period ranged from a low of 90 for both crewmen to a high of about 125 for Buzz Aldrin at 2 periods. And, a high of 160 for Neil Armstrong at 3 periods. That top reading coming during the time he was transferring the rock boxes into the LM. Dr. Berry says the data they got indicates Neil Armstrong was working very hard at that time.
112:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 19 minutes. The inhabitants of Tranquility Base are still in the post EVA clean up period. Still have not fully configured the voice communications, however, we are getting telemetry - good telemetry from Tranquility Base showing a cabin pressure of 5 pounds per square inch, temperature of 60 degrees. We expect to establish communications before too long. During this period the crew is removing the portable life support systems, checking over their spacecrafts systems, getting ready for jettisoning equipment from Tranquility Base. The cabin will be depressurized before too long and equipment will be jettisoned onto the lunar surface.
112:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Dr. Berry reports those dosimeter readings have not changed since yesterday afternoon indicating that the crew was not subjected to radiation on the surface of the Moon or if any a very negligible amount.
113:09:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control - -
113:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 113 hours, 18 minutes. We have had loss of signal from Columbia. We have asked Mike Collins to stay awake through acquisition on the next rev which will be number 20 so that we can check the automatic acquisition mode of the high gain antenna. Once we've verified that, he will start his rest period. The planned wake up for Command Module pilot 121 hours.
113:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo control. We're estimating the change of shift news briefing for 2:00AM central daylight time. 2:00AM central daylight time for the change of shift briefing.
113:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 29 minutes. The change of shift news briefing is about to start. We will take any air-ground transmissions during this period for playback after the briefing. If the equipment jettison occurs during the briefing, we will come back up and provide that for you live.
114:01:00|PAO|- hours one minute. We have about 2 minutes worth of tape. We'll play that for you now.
114:01:00|PAO|We're live now. The Capcom voice on that last transmission was Deke Slayton, the director of Flight Crew Operations here at MSC.
114:01:00|PAO|We said good night to Mike Collins and Columbia at 114 hours 6 minutes. And the cabin is coming down now on Tranquility Base. And it's down to about three and a half pounds now and holding that.
114:01:00|PAO|The Tranquility Base pressure coming on down now, one and a half pounds.
114:01:00|PAO|Less than half a pound of pressure now.
114:11:00|PAO|Unofficial time for start of this second depressurization 114 hours, 8 minutes, 12 seconds. Suit pressur2 is holding at about 3.9 pounds per square inch. The cabin pressure down to about a tenth of a pound now. .04 pounds now. There went something. Looked like a portable life support system. Here comes the other PLSS. Cabin is being repressurized now. The experiments console reports the seismometer recorded both the impacts of those portable life support systems. Cabin pressure up over 1 psi. Up to 2 now. 3 pounds per square inch. 4 pounds. Leveling off to about 4.8.
114:11:00|PAO|Items scheduled to be jettisoned were the two portable life support systems, the lithium hydroxide canister, and the arm rests from the LM. We expect the crew to turn off the TV very shortly switching over to the -
114:21:00|PAO|Switching over to another telemetry mode when they turn off the TV switch.
114:21:00|PAO|And the TV went off at 114 hours 25 minutes 47 seconds.
114:42:00|PAO|The CAPCOM there was astronaut Owen Garrett, one of the group of five scientists astronauts selected in 1965.
114:52:00|PAO|Tranquility Base has confirmed that they left on the lunar surface all the items they had planned to. We have said good night to Neil Armstrong and Buz Aldrin. We will continue to monitor throughout this rest period which is scheduled to end at about 122 hours elapsed time. We're now 114 hours 53 minutes. Should there be any further conversations with either Tranquility Base or Columbia, we will come back up and bring those to you. This is Mission Control, Houston.
115:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 50 minutes. It's been almost an hour since we said good night to Tranquility Base. Dr. Kenneth Biers, the flight surgeon on this shift, reports that he does not believe that Neil Armstrong is asleep yet. From his heart rate, he thinks he's resting and perhaps dozing from time to time, but he doesn't believe that he is asleep. Neil is the only one being monitored in Tranquility Base. There is no biomedical instrumentation for Buzz Aldrin. Dr. Biers reports that Mike Collins is sound asleep in Columbia as it orbits the Moon. Columbia has just entered its 21st revolution of the Moon. All systems on the Lunar Module are in good order, showing cabin pressure of 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin temperature 62 degrees Fahrenheit. We have not heard from Tranquility Base since saying good night and we have not attempted to call them. This is Mission Control, Houston.
116:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 116 hours 50 minutes. All systems in both Columbia and Tranquility Base still operating very well. No problems. Dr. Kenneth Biers' report is the same as the one an hour ago. The data from Neil Armstrong indicates that he is resting, but he is not believed to be asleep, not following the pattern of sleep, but he is resting. Cabin pressure is holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch, temperature at 62 degrees Fahrenheit. The consumables in Tranquility Base are still in good shape, showing 45 and a half per cent of the descent water still remaining, the water very important for cooling on the lunar surface. Showing 63 per cent of the oxygen supply in the Descent Stage still remaining. Both of those consumables in the Ascent Stage very high - have not been used yet. Two water tanks in the Ascent Stage, each one showing 97.6 per cent; the other showing 98.4. Two oxygen tanks in the Ascent Stage, one reading 93 and a half per cent, the other 96.8 per cent. Mike Collins still asleep in Columbia. At 116 hours 52 minutes, all still going well with both spacecrafts. This is Mission Control, Houston.
117:54:40|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 117 hours 54 minutes. All continues to go well with both Columbia orbiting the Moon, now in its 22nd revolution, and Tranquility Base on the surface of the Moon. Flight surgeon Dr. Kenneth Biers says his data continues to indicate that Neil Armstrong may be dozing but he's sure that he is not sleeping soundly or well. Heart rates have been down in the 50's at times, but have not stayed there very long. He believes he may be sleeping fitfully and dozing, but stirring around quite a bit. Mike Collins still sleeping in Columbia and the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin is not instrumented so the doctors cannot determine whether he's asleep or not. Cabin pressure in the Lunar Module still holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch. Temperature has dropped one degree since last report, now reading 61 degrees Fahrenheit. All consumables are still in good shape. This is Mission Control, Houston.
118:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 118 hours 50 minutes. Flight controllers here in Mission Control Center continue to monitor the systems of Eagle at Tranquility base consistently and of Columbia when that spacecraft is within acquisition on the front side of the Moon. And they are in acquisition of Columbia telemetry now, it's in it's 22 revolution. Everything continuing to go very well. All systems normal. Mike Collins is still alseep, very well, in Columbia. Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully, if indeed he is asleep at all at Tranquility base. Throughout this rest period the cabin pressure has held very steady at 4.9 in the Lunar Module. We're still showing a cabin temperature of 61. This is Mission Control, Houston.
119:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 119 hours, 51 minutes. The report is the same as it has been throughout the rest period. All systems in both Eagle and Columbia are operating very well, Mike Collins asleep, Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully. The heart rate goes down into the sleep range but then comes up out of it indicating he is stirring around considerably. Columbia is in its 23rd revolution now in an orbit 62 by 57 nautical miles. Still holding 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin pressure 61 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. The descent water quantity now shows 39 and one-half percent remaining. Descent oxygen quantity 63 percent remaining. This is Mission Control, Houston.
120:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 120 hours 59 minutes ground elapsed time. We've called the spacecraft Columbia from Mission Control here to wake up Mike Collins. The network is configured so that the LM crew, the Eagle crew, will not be disturbed. Lets join the conversation in progress.
121:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft Columbia has gone behind the Moon on the twenty-third lunar revolution. Be acquired again at - well, let's see now, it looks like we don't have acquisition table up yet for next rev. During this pass and the short conversation toward the end of the front side pass with Columbia, the network transmitters have been arranged so that the transmissions would not disturb the crew of Eagle who at this time should be asleep. Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins is experiencing during this 47 minutes of each lunar revolution when he's behind the Moon with no one to talk to except his tape recorder aboard Columbia. While he waits for his comrades to soar with Eagle from Tranquility Base and rejoin him for the trip back to Earth, Collins, with the help of flight controllers here in Mission Control Center has kept the Command Module's system going "pocketa-pocketapocketa". At 120 hours, 12 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
121:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Let's join the call to Tranquility Base.
121:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. A little over 2 minutes until Columbia comes over the hill again on the 24th Lunar Revolution. In that wake up call to Eagle, the crew described how they slept in the spacecraft by lying on the floor and on the engine cover. Some of the preliminary times being generated now ascent show ignition about 1 minute 26 seconds earlier than the pre-mission flight plan. Ignition time now showing 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds. Burn will have a magnitude of 6,068 feet per second. Quite a bit of that will be in vertical rise and actually starting from zero feet per second on the lunar surface. The CSI maneuver behind the Moon, the Concentric Sequence Initiate, CSI the acronym being for that maneuver. 125 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds. Consistent Delta height CDH 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds. Terminal Phase initiation 126 hours 57 minutes 0 seconds, and Terminal Phase Finalization or the final breaking before docking 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. These are Ground computations. And they will be computed by the crew from radar tracking, rendezvous radar. So actually these number computed on the Ground are somewhat academic in that they will be computed in real time by the crew. We're standing by here for Capcom to resume conversation. During this up coming pass here, more definite fix on the Eagle positions will be attempted by using the rendezvous radar from the Eagle in Program 22, rendezvous radar lunar surface navigation program. The transponder on Columbia in the meantime has been warmed up. During the last revolution, Mike Collins was advised to - have the - the transponder warmed up. As of now, the exact location is somewhat vague. And perhaps this rendezvous radar exercise will give a final, more pinpoint location of where Eagle does indeed nest on the Moon. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit. We've had acquisition of signal with Columbia, so likely the conversation will increase here as we get the
122:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation of radar lock on.
122:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 5 minutes 35 seconds away from loss of signal with the spacecraft Columbia before it goes on the far side of the Moon on the 24th revolution. 1 hour, 18 minutes until ascent ignition and following that the rendezvous sequence completed with the docking at 128 hours approximately. We'll continue to monitor air-to-ground here as data is passed up to the crew for the upcoming day's activities. Apollo Control standing by at 123 hours and 3 minutes.
123:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal with Columbia going behind the Moon. Toward the end of that pass, Apollo 11 backup commander, Jim Lovell, who's had some experience in Lunar missions came up with his congratulations with his job-well-done. He mentioned that he would be here giving moral support during the rendezvous sequence to follow. There are likely to be further communications with Eagle until the Command Module comes around the corner again some 44 minutes from now We'll bring the circuit back up as communications resume perhaps playing catch up with tape recordings, and at 123 hours, 10 minutes ground elapsed time, 1 hour, 11 minutes to ignition this is Apollo - stand by. We may be - let's listen in again.
123:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 57 minutes 22 seconds away from ignition on the LM ascent back into lunar orbit. Some 30 minutes away from acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia, as it comes around again on the 25th revolution. And the latest information from the scientific experiment placed on the lunar surface last night by the Apollo 11 crew, our Science Support Room reports receiving continuous data from the Passive Seismic Experiment. The Passive Seismic Experiment is part of the early Apollo science experiment package which has the acronym ASEP. Recorded the astronauts footsteps on the Moon; also sent down signals when the crew climbed up the ladder back into the Eagle, and recorded a strong signal when they expended Portable Life Support
123:18:00|PAO|Backpacks and other pieces of equipment were jettisoned out Eagle's front hatch. Let's rejoin the conversation.
123:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in mission Control Center Flight Director Glen Lunney is polling the various positions here in the control room on their readiness to go ahead with the ascent from this next pass as the Command Module comes around the Moon, and we're some 53 minutes now away from ascent. Meanwhile back at the scientific experiment situation, another attempt is scheduled today to shoot another laser beam up to the laser retro-reflector, which is the other part of the experiment package left on the Moon. The seismic experiment will continue to record and send back measurements to mission control and will probably receive it's strongest signal when the ascent engine ignites and starts Eagle on it's way into lunar orbit and rendezvous with Columbia. There's considerable amount of conversation going on with the crew even though Command Module Columbia is behind the Moon at this time. Rather than disconnect the air-ground line and be in a tape play-back mode, we'll leave a circuit up all the way through to loss of signal on the next rev when both spacecraft will go behind the Moon. At 123 hours, 29 minutes, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
124:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are some 3 minutes to acquisition time for Columbia as it comes around on the 25th lunar revolution. We have had acquisition with Columbia. Some 26 minutes away from ignition time on the ascent burn which will place Eagle back into lunar orbit. Here we go.
124:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control in Mission Control. The lunar orbit chart on the center plot board has disappeared. We now have the various scribing plotters projecting on the center plot board to show the ascent. All of these lines and the various colors that are scribed on by the three sources of primary guidance system, the abort guidance system and the manned space-wide network all mean something to Flight Dynamics Officer. Let's rejoin the conversation.
123:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation on the ground that the ascent propulsion system propellant tanks have been pressurized.
123:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Network controller just informed the flight director that items called battle shorts have been installed around the network. These are mechanical shorts of critical power supplies and transmitters and the like, so that before they will go off-1ine, they'll actually burn up in critical phases of the mission. They want to get as much data as possible through the burn, so for that reason any circuit breaking function of the equipment is inhibited with these battle shorts. They're not a piece of apparel. In the upcoming ascent some 14 minutes from now, almost 5000 pounds of propellant will be run through the ascent engine to propel the Lunar Module upper stage or
123:58:00|PAO|Ascent Stage to velocity - total velocity of 6068 feet per second. Go through a vertical rise phase at about 50 seconds after liftover - liftoff will begin pitching over, and some 168 miles down range will be inserted into lunar orbit at about 60,000 feet above the surface. With an apolune of approximately forty -
124:08:00|PAO|- and about 60,000 feet above the surface. With an apolune of approximately 45 nautical miles half a revolution later on the far side of the Moon. We will continue to monitor air-ground here. We are some 1 hour away from loss of signal with the Lunar Module after its insertion. Eagle now 13 minutes away from - 13 minutes, 23 seconds away from ascent ignition. 124 hours, 8 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission. Apollo Control standing by.
124:08:00|PAO|Crew of Eagle going through their pre-ignition checklist.
124:18:00|PAO|The guidance computer aboard the LM, or aboard Eagle will be loaded with the program 12, powered ascent guidance. We'll continue to monitor now at 3 minutes 12 seconds away from ignition as the crew of Eagle goes through their pre-launch checklist.
124:18:00|PAO|Coming up on 2 minutes, Mark T-minus 2 minutes.
124:18:00|PAO|Guidance reports both navigation systems on Eagle are looking good.
124:18:00|PAO|1000 feet high, 80 feet per second vertical rise.
124:18:00|PAO|2600 feet altitude.
124:18:00|PAO|130 feet vertical rise rate.
124:18:00|PAO|Aldrin is reading the horizontal velocity first and then the vertical velocity. It's now 1424 feet per
124:18:00|PAO|second vertical velocity, 187 vertical velocity.
124:18:00|PAO|Height now approaching 32,000 feet.
124:18:00|PAO|Horizontal velocity approaching 2500 feet per second.
124:18:00|PAO|Some 120 miles to go till insertion.
124:18:00|PAO|All 3 data sources are agreeing quite closely here. The 3 color plot board in front of Mission Control here is almost superimposed as each of the 3 colors are scribed on this scribing plotter.
124:28:00|PAO|One minute to go in the burn. 4482 feet per second, horizontal velocity.
124:28:00|PAO|Showing a perilune of 9.1 nautical miles, apolune of 47.2 nautical miles on the PNGCS. All three systems are GO. Shutoff velocity showing about 5,537 feet per second plus or minus a foot or so on each of the three systems.
124:28:00|PAO|Here in Mission Control the scribing plotter showing the velocity in height - here we go again.
124:28:00|PAO|Here in Mission Control the scribing plotters have been replaced with the lunar orbit tracking chart showing the Eagle behind Spider some 20 degrees in longitude. Flight Operations Director, Chris Kraft, commented that he felt like some 500,000,000 people around the world are helping push Eagle off the Moon and back into orbit. We're continuing to monitor transmissions between the ground and Eagle and Columbia. Apollo Control standing by.
124:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. During the ascent phase, the heart rates on the Eagle crew reached 90 for Neil Armstrong, 120 for Buzz Aldrin. They're now back down in the 80's. For some 28 minutes 15 seconds from loss of signal with Columbia, 29'minutes 52 seconds away from loss of signal on Eagle.
124:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia has gone behind the Moon. Still a little over a minute left until Eagle goes behind the Moon. We'll catch these last few minutes of tracking and any possible conversation.
125:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal with Eagle. Quite scratchy as Eagle went over the hill to complete the 25th lunar revolution as it gets to the midpoint on the lunar far side. Ascent burn just completed went quite well on time at 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds ground elapsed time. Coming up on this rev, approximately 10 minutes from now as a matter of fact, will be the concentric sequence initiate maneuver, CSI, which will raise the Eagle's perilune to some 45 nautical miles. Eagle now is in an orbit measuring 9.4 nautical miles at insertion or perilune, and 46.7 at apolune, This CSI maneuver will be made approximately at apolune. Therefore, the effect takes place 180 degrees later and has the effect of raising perilune to the desired 45 nautical miles. This maneuver will take place at 125 hours 19 minutes 34.7 seconds. He will have a DELTA-V or velocity change of 51.5 feet per second. All of these maneuvers, incidentally, in the rendezvous sequence by Eagle will be made by using the Reaction Control System of Eagle. Following the CSI at 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds a 9.2 foot per second burn, probably mostly a radial burn, at 126 hours 18 minutes will twist the Eagle's orbit to equal distance from the orbit of Columbia, what they call a constant DELTA height, or CDH maneuver. At 126 hours 57 minutes 00 seconds, terminal phase initiation, TPI. In this maneuver the crew visually thrusts along the line of sight toward Columbia when the line of sight is some 27 degrees above the local horizontal. This maneuver will have a magnitude of about 24.9 feet per second, and, in turn, it raises the apolune to 60.5 nautical miles, which is approximately the altitude Columbia's orbiting. Terminal phase finalization. TPF 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. This is the start time for a series of small burns which are a combination of mid-course correction and velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle in with Columbia and match the velocity so that they station-keep for a short period for photography, etc., and move on in to docking at approximately 128 hours ground elapsed time. In all of these maneuvers Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver approximately a minute after the Eagle is scheduled to make its maneuver, and if for some reason Eagle can not make the maneuver, Collins would do the exact same maneuver only in reverse so that Columbia would in effect begin a CSM active rendezvous with Eagle. As Eagle went over the hill on the 25th revolution, a velocity was being measured at 5410 feet per second. Eagle's weight somewhat lighter than when it started out in excess of
125:08:00|PAO|32,000 pounds, it's now shrunk to some 5885 pounds. Some 39 minutes 20 seconds away from acquisition of Columbia. 41 minutes 45 seconds from acquisition of Eagle as the 2 vehicles come around on the 26th revolution. The crew will likely describe how the CSI burn went, which is some 5 minutes away from this point, and at 125 hours 14 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
125:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 125 hours, 52 minutes ground elapsed time. Less than 1 minute away from the acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia coming around on the near side of the Moon on the twenty sixth revolution. Some 3 minutes, 11 seconds away from Eagle's appearance on on the lunar front side. Stand by here for word. We have acquired data and voice link. Spacecraft Communicator, Ron Evans, is standing by for AOS so that he can pass some information to the crew of the two spacecraft. We have AOS of the spacecraft, Columbia.
125:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia is now in an orbit measuring 56.6 nautical miles by 62.5 nautical miles, and the display here in mission control shows that the range from Eagle to Columbia of a tad over 100 miles. And about 99 feet per second closure rate.
126:07:00|PAO|Apollo Control here. Less than a minute remaining until the constant DELTA height or CDH maneuver. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground. This small magnitude radial burn to put Eagle in a orbit that's concentric with -
126:17:00|PAO|- the Eagle in an orbit that's concentric with. Here we go. 30 seconds.
126:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Range now showing 91.3 nautical miles, range rate, rate of closure 119 feet per second.
126:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Range between Eagle and Columbia now showing 67.5 nautical miles. Range rate, closure rate, 121 feet per second.
126:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 25 minutes now until the TPI, terminal phase initiation burn, just before loss of signal as both spacecraft go over the hill.
126:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control the black team of flight controllers here in Mission Control are more or less in an advisory capacity during this rendezvous sequence. They're actively computing maneuver times, but in the final analysis it's onboard computations by the crew of Columbia and Eagle which really bring about the rendezvous. Standing by.
126:17:00|PAO|which nearly bring about to rendezvous. Standing by at 126 hours 37 minutes ground elapse times. Some 24 minutes away from ignition on the thrust along the line of sight for Terminal Phase Initiate.
126:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control about 6 and 1/2 minutes to ignition on the thermal phase maneuver in which the crew Eagle will thrust along the line of sight toward Columbia. Distance now between the two spacecraft
126:48:00|PAO|some 38.6 nautical miles closing at a rate of 110 feet per second.
126:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've apparently had loss of signal with Columbia and Eagle as they went behind the Moon on the 26th revolution. Next maneuver scheduled for about 33 minutes from now. While both vehicles are behind this will be the breaking series of maneuvers coming down to docking, or station keeping first and then docking at about 128 hours ground elapsed time. And at 127 hours 6 minutes ground elapsed time in the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control.
127:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 127 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. We're less than a minute now away from acquisition of the spacecraft, Columbia. Hopefully, we find within a few feet of it, will be Eagle. Docking should take place about 10 minutes from now, according to the flight plan. However, this is a crew option matter. We're standing by for word that data is coming in from the two spacecraft. This is lunar revolution number 27 for Columbia. We have LM AOS
128:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Communications are somewhat scratchy with Apollo 11. Columbia and Eagle now reunited to become Apollo 11 again. Our best estimate on the time of docking is some 3 minutes after the pre-mission time of 128 hours. Continuing to monitor this 27th lunar orbit for the two-way communications between the two spacecraft.
128:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control still rather noisy communications here on the 27th lunar revolution. 39 minutes remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon. We'll leave the circuit up and try to monitor the conversation between the two spacecraft or between the Apollo 11 and the ground for the remainder of this pass - try to ascertain the status onboard as far as transferring the crew and other items back into the Command Module. The cleanup in the LM getting all the items dusted off prior to bringing them back in the Command Module. At 128 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, standing by, this is Apollo Control.
128:56:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon on the 27th revolution. The signal from the passive seismometer, which was left on the Moon by the crew of Eagle, was lost for 30 minutes beginning about 5 minutes before Eagle took off this morning. The signal was lost because of a equipment problem that the Canary Island tracking station. The Seismic equipment is back on line now, and is beginning to record lunar day surface temperatures. The dust detector recorded zero dust after Eagle lift off. The laser ground station have not yet acquired a return signal from the Laser Ranging Retro Reflector. Five minutes away from loss of signal with Apollo 11. We will continue to monitor the air-to-ground as the spacecraft goes over the hill. The crew now is engaged in the decontamination procedures inside the Lunar Module prior to transferring back into the Command Module.
128:56:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 went around the back side of the Moon on the 27th rev. We'll have acquisition with Apollo 11 approximately 45 minutes from now. At - Let's see - Would you believe they don't have the next tables up for the next rev. At any rate, 45 minutes from now, and at 129 hours 4 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
129:13:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 129 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 36 minutes 40 seconds from coming around the other side of the Moon for reacquisition on the 28th revolution. We're nearing the end of the 27th revolution at this time. On the backside of the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin should be involved in preparing for transferring back to the Command Module with Mike Collins, and they'll be cleaning up equipment and vacuuming off any particles of dust that remain before transferring to the Command Module. About 15 minutes after we reacquire we would expect Neil Armstrong to be ready for the transfer to the Command Module. Buzz Aldrin to follow along behind about 30 or 40 minutes later. Here in Mission Control we're presently completing the shift change. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Glenn Lunney, and the Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. The change of shift briefing is scheduled to occur in the news center at 6 p.m. Central Daylight Time. At 129 hours, 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
130:16:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 16 minutes. We reacquired Apollo 11 about 25 minutes ago, at 129 51. At that time Mike Collins reported that all 3 crewmen were in the Command Module. The transfer occurring while the spacecraft were on the back side of the Moon. They had closed out the LM early and had transferred to the second coolant loop. That decision was made in mission control because the secondary loop was on, the primary loop disabled in the close out process. We did not want to have the LM docked to the CSM for an undue length of time, because the primary guidance system is not cooled. The decision was initially made to jettison the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, however the crew continued ahead of schedule. They were ready to jettison ahead of that time, and Collins reported at 130 10 about, 17 minutes ago, that they were, had jettisoned the LM and said it had departed at several feet per second, and we heard a comment from Buzz Aldrin, that he noticed some cracks in the thermo covering around the LM tunnel, docking area, however he said it did not appear to be a structural crack but merely some cracks in the thermal covering. We are currently scheduled to perform the small Reaction Control System maneuver with the command and Service Module for separation from the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, or about 12 minutes from now. We'll pick up this pass as it began on tape and when we've caught up, we'll continue to follow the activity live.
130:36:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 46 minutes. That Command Module separation, maneuver, which occurred at 130 hours 30 minutes, was a 2 foot per second retrograde burn. Burn duration was 7 seconds. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that at transEarth injection, which is scheduled to occur as per the flight plan, at about 135 hours 25 minutes, and at that time, the CSM will be about 20 miles ahead of the LM and about I mile below.
130:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point or pericynthian of 54.9. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 5 thousand 3 hundred 55 feet per second. We will reacquire the spacecraft in a little over 45 minutes on the 21st revolution. At 131 hours 3 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
131:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 48 minutes. We're standing by to reacquire Apollo - Apollo 11. Acquisition should come in about 5 seconds. This revolution should be relatively quiet. We don't have a great deal of activity scheduled. The crew may have time to get something to eat, and here on the ground we will be computing the information needed for their transEarth injection burn. We do have data now from the spacecraft. We'll standby for a call to the crew.
131:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We suspect the crew is having something to eat at this time which probably accounts for the relatively quiet period. One of the things that we are watching with interest here in Mission Control is the Lunar Module. At the time Aldrin and Armstrong left the LM and came back into the Service Module, they switched over to the secondary cooling loop as part of a test that we are running to determine just how long the primary guidance and navigation system will last without cooling. The primary guidance system is not cooled on the secondary loop which provides backup cooling for the secondary guidance system and it has always been a point of interest as to just how long the primary guidance system will survive without cooling - estimates range up to several hours. The LM TEL COMM Controller reports that at this time we are seeing some rise in the PIPAS. These are the Pulse Integrating Pendulum - Pendulous Accelerometers which - the primary guidance system uses to detect changes in motion and attitude and of course they are an essential item in the - the primary guidance system. We are seeing a gradual rise in temperature but the TEL COMM engineer reports that the primary guidance system still looks very good. At the time the crew reported they were back that Armstrong and Aldrin reported that they were back in the Command Module, we asked them what time they did switch over to the secondary loop. Armstrong estimated that that occurred about 129 hours 40 minutes which was a little over 2 hours ago. We will continue to monitor the LM and to observe the performance of the primary guidance system. All systems on the command Service Module continue to function very well at this time and the same can be said for the Lunar Module. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in a orbit 62.5 nautical miles by 54.2. The spacecraft traveling at a speed of 5349 feet per second.
131:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 15 minutes. We have some preliminary figures on the transEarth injection maneuver scheduled to occur about 3 hours, 8 minutes from now. The time of ignition is - stand by just a moment. The time of ignition would be 135 hours, 23 minutes 41 seconds.
132:24:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 29 minutes. That last string of numbers read up to the spacecraft included the information the crew will need to start them on their way back to Earth in about 2 hours, 54 minutes. The time of ignition for the transEarth injection burn again is 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. They will burn their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes, 28 seconds and increasing their speed by 3283 feet per second. And our preliminary estimate is that that will put them into the Pacific Ocean at the primary landing site at 195 hours, 18 minutes, 47 seconds, ground elapsed time, or almost precisely on the flight plan. The spacecraft weight at the time they do the transEarth injection burn will be 36,691 pounds. We'll continue to stand by for any communication from the spacecraft. We now have about 29 minutes, 30 seconds until the Apollo 11 goes around the corner and behind the Moon out of radio contact.
132:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now about 30 seconds from loss of signal with Apollo 11 on the 29th revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 46 minutes. As the spacecraft comes around on its 30th revolution, that will be the next to the last full revolution in lunar orbit. The transEarth injection maneuver will be performed at the end of the 30th revolution, just after - actually, just after beginning the 31st revolution of the Moon. Apollo 11 is now in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point of 54.2. The current spacecraft velocity is 5,356 feet per second, and we show an orbital weight of 36,691 pounds. We have loss of signal now. We'll be coming back up when we reacquire in about 45 minutes. At 133 hours, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
133:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 133 hours 45 minutes. We're now 50 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the 30th revolution of the Moon. This will be our last front side pass before transEarth injection. On this revolution we'll be passing up to the crew the final computations for their transEarth injection maneuver, which is scheduled to occur at 135 hours 23 minutes 42 seconds, or about 1 hour 38 minutes from now. We should have acquisition of signal now in about 10 seconds. We'll stand by.
133:45:00|PAO|We have acquired the signal from the spacecraft now. We're standing by at this time for a call from the crew or for Capcom Charlie Duke to put in a call to the crew from the ground. We presently show the Lunar Module in an orbit 63.3 by 56 nautical miles, the command Service Module is in an orbit 63.2 by 53.9. At the time of the transEarth injection burn we expect that the Command Module will be about 1 mile below the LM and about 20 miles in front of it.
133:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At this time the crew should be involved in their pre-transEarth injection status checks. They will also be aligning the platform on their spacecraft guidance system and will be passing up the final information for the transEarth injection burn computed on the ground. A few minutes ago you heard Charlie Duke advise the crew that we show the LM platform is about to go. We've mentioned that prior to leaving the Lunar Module the crew had deactivated the primary cooling loop placing the secondary cooling loop in operation aboard the LM. This means that the primary guidance system does not get cooling. This is part of a preplanned test to find out just how long the primary guidance system would continue to function without cooling. We had predicted in advance that it would - may not - possibly not last much longer than a hour or so, but at the time Charlie Duke reported the platform had just gone down on the LM, it had been in operation without cooling a little more than four hours. We had an approximate time from the crew of transferring to the secondary cooling loop of about 129 hours 40 minutes and we got the report from Duke that the LM guidance platform was no longer usable at 133 hours 55 minutes. We'll continue to standby for any further conversation from the crew. We're now one hour twenty minutes ten seconds away from transEarth injection which will occur on the backside of the Moon at the beginning of the thirty-first revolution.
134:05:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours, 10 minutes. We have about 47 minutes, 30 seconds before losing contact with Apollo 11 as it goes behind the Moon in preparation for the transEarth injection burn. With the burn we would reacquire the spacecraft at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 11 seconds. Without the transEarth injection burn on the upcoming revolution we would reacquire at 135 hours, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. The final figures on that burn as passed up to the crew a few minutes ago are as follows: ignition will occur at 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. The burn duration will be 2 minutes, 28 seconds. That will add 3284 feet per second to the spacecraft velocity starting it on its path back to Earth. And we would consume about 10,000 pounds of propellant with that burn. Splash would occur according to our preliminary figures, just about precisely as predicted in the flight plan. We'll continue to monitor now for any further conversation from the spacecraft.
134:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 134 hours, 32 minutes. Flight director Gene Kranz just requested his flight controllers to view all of their data, take a good look at the spacecraft, and be prepared to make go, no go recommendations shortly for the transEarth injection burn. That maneuver now 51 minutes, 27 seconds away. All systems on the spacecraft looking good at this point. The cabin temperature has been running about 72 degrees. At this time, the crew is aligning the platform on their guidance system. The stable platform used as a attitude reference for the upcoming burn. We've had very little conversation both here in the Control Center and from the spacecraft on this pass. We'll continue to stand by and monitor.
134:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 48 minutes. It continues very quiet out here in mission control. The flight controllers have been observing the crew inputs through their computer and monitoring as the crew prepares for the trans Earth injection burn, scheduled to occur in about 35 minutes from now. We have now 9 minutes 20 seconds until loss of signal. The spacecraft currently traveling at a speed of 5,329 feet per second and the altitude is 62.5 nautical miles. At the time of the trans Earth injection burn, the Lunar Module, Eagle, should be about 20 miles behind the Command Module.
134:45:00|PAO|The crew has a go for the trans Earth injection at the beginning of the 31 revolution. All systems on the spacecraft are looking very good at this point. You heard Capcom Charlie Duke advise Mike Collins that we will reacquire the spacecraft on the other side of the Moon. Now with the burn the ground elapsed time of 135 hours 34 minutes and 5 seconds. Without the burn we reacquire at 135 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds. We now have 6 minutes 50 seconds until loss of signal. We will continue to monitor.
134:45:00|PAO|Thirty seconds now until loss of signal. We've had a last status check from the flight director and all around the room the word is go. We're now 26 minutes 23 seconds from the trans Earth injection maneuver - 20 seconds until loss of signal.
134:45:00|PAO|And we have loss of signal now. We should next reacquire Apollo 11 at 135 hours 34 minutes 5 seconds. We are now 25 minutes 38 seconds from trans Earth injection.
135:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now less than 30 seconds from the time in which trans-Earth injection is scheduled, the burn to start Apollo 11 on its trajectory back to Earth. We're now 15 seconds from the scheduled ignition time. That burn will last about 2 minutes 28 seconds and consume 10,000 pounds of propellant. The crew should be burning at this time. Of course, that maneuver is performed on the back side of the Moon. We have no data from the spacecraft here in Mission Control at this time. We won't know how the burn went for about another ten minutes, which is the time of which we're scheduled to reacquire Apollo 11. During the course of this burn the spacecraft will increase its speed by about 3280 feet per second, or about 2240 miles per hour.
135:19:00|PAO|Trans-Earth injection should be completed in about 10 seconds from now. And we should have shut-down at this time. At this point Apollo 11 should be traveling at a speed of about 8660 feet per second, or about 5900 miles per hour. It should be on its way back to Earth, headed for Splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 195 hours 18 minutes. With a successful burn we should reacquire Apollo 11 in 7 minutes 20 seconds from now.
135:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now less than 1 minute from reacquiring Apollo 11. When last we heard from the spacecraft all systems were looking very good and we were in very good shape for the transEarth injection maneuver. At this point Apollo 11 should be about 10,000 pounds lighter and on its way back to Earth. We're now 32 seconds from reacquiring. We'll stand by for communications with the spacecraft.
135:33:00|PAO|And there's the cue, we have acquisition of signal. And we have data right on schedule. Rog. Zero minus 0.7 minus 0.2.
135:33:00|PAO|Most of the conversations so far has been from Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins. That last comment came from Collins. Our first report after acquisition was from Neil Armstrong. That transEarth injection burn was very close to nominal. At this time we show the spacecraft traveling at a speed of 7,603 feet per second. The velocity already beginning to drop off and we're at an altitude of 445 nautical miles now from the Moon. This is Apollo Control. We now show the spacecraft traveling at 7,378 feet per second. Altitude 568 nautical miles. The next order of business will
135:33:00|PAO|be to get the crew to sleep. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, requested his flight controllers, prior to acquisition of signal to review their procedures and to take as many steps as possible to get the crew to sleep as soon as possible. There will be a press conference in the building 1 auditorium. We estimate the time on that at about 12:300 Central Daylight Time. And our LM telecommunications engineer reports that we've just had acquisition of signal from Eagle which is still in lunar orbit. The last fix that we had on Eagle's orbit showed an apogee of 64. 1 and a para - apocynthion rather of 64. 1 and a pericynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. The spacecraft altitude is now climbed to almost 700 nautical miles from the Moon. We show a weight of 26,510 pounds. About 10,000 pounds less than what we had actually about 1100 or 11,000 pounds - lets correct that - about 10,100 pounds less than what we had prior to the transEarth injection burn.
135:46:00|PAO|This is Apollo control. The flight dynamics officer reports that the burn very nominal. Almost precisely as planned, the burn duration was about 3 seconds long, but the velocity change was almost precisely what we had been expecting. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 1076 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity continuing to drop off, down now to 6698 feet per second.
136:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 136 hours, 44 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 3,720 nautical miles from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 5,367 feet per second. During the press conference we accumulated about 4 minutes of taped conversation with the crew. The crew reports at this time that they are completing taking pictures and they are getting ready to realign their guidance system platform. We'll pick up the tape conversation and then stand by for any following live communications with the crew. We anticipate that they will be shortly beginning their pre-sleep checklist in preparation for a well deserved rest period.
136:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the taped conversation. We'll stand by for any further live communication from the crew before they begin their sleep period. We've gotten some preliminary figures from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transEarth injection burn after a review of the telemetry data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal. Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost precisely as predicted or planned in the flight plan. That would be at 195 hours and 18 minutes, 40 seconds ground elapse time. And we would expect that splash down time to change some what during the transEarth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for mid-course correction becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles from the Moon
136:44:00|PAO|traveling at almost precisely 1 mile per second, 5,283 feet per second and that's just updated 5,280 feet per second.
136:44:00|PAO|That exchange was between Donald K, Deke, Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center and astronaut Neil Armstrong.
137:24:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 137 hours, 27 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of about 4982 feet per second. At about 5900 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 198,900 nautical miles from Earth. A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene on the lunar surface at the time the planned Ascent Stage lifted off. Armstrong reported seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton, which is a plastic-like insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is found on the outside surface of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes, about 40 minutes or so ago that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived of the coolant, a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant. The platform apparently begin to become unuseable after about 4 hours, and the computer itself finally gave up after about 7 hours, 13 minutes. Both items going considerably longer than had previously been predicted. The Lunar Module Ascent Stage still in lunar orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. All other systems appear to be functioning well at this time. The LM orbit we show as currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And, the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and here's a call to the crew.
137:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 137 hours, 52 minutes. Apollo 11 crew has signed off for the night, starting a well deserved rest period. Duration of the rest period is programmed for 10 hours, however, the wake up time is not critical. It's very likely that we'll let them sleep until they wake up of their own accord. At this time Columbia is 7,045 nautical miles away from the Moon, headed toward home at a velocity of 4,868 feet per second.
138:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 02 minutes. Capcom Owen Garriott has just put in a call to the crew and is passing up some antenna information to them. Here's that conversation.
138:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Ten minutes ago we logged what we expect to be our last contact with Eagle in lunar orbit. That coming at 137 hours 55 minutes Elapsed Time. At that time the battery power fell below the level where the secondary guidance system could hold the attitude of the vehicle within the sphere of antenna limits. We do not expect to establish contact with Eagle again. We'll continue to stand by here live. There may be a little more conversation before the crew turns in for the night.
138:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 11 minutes. We do not intend to contact the crew during this rest period again. We will take this lying down now and come back up if there is further conversation. This is Mission Control, Houston.
139:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 139 hours. The crew of Apollo 11 is in the rest period. We have not contacted them within the last hour, and have not heard from them. All systems aboard the spacecraft performing well. Apollo 11 is now 10,149 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4659 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 26,510 pounds. This is mission control, Houston.
140:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 140 hours. Apollo 11 is now 12,835 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4552 feet per second. All systems still performing well. Dr. Kenneth Biers, the flight surgeon, reports his data indicates all three of the crewmen are asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.
141:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 141 hours. Apollo 11 is 15,488 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,480 feet per second. The crew is still asleep. All systems continuing to perform very well. This is Mission Control, Houston.
142:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 03 minutes. Apollo 11 is 18,243 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4426 feet per second. Apollo 11 is in the passive thermal control mode, the performance of all systems nominal, and the crew is asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.
143:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 143 hours. Apollo 11 is 20,704 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 4390 feet per second. The crew is still is the rest period. The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported this morning that weather conditions in the primary landing area are expected to the acceptable, the sky partly cloudy, the winds easterly at 10 knots, and seas of 3 feet are predicted. Tropical storm Claudia is now located 2300 miles east of the landing area and will not affect the weather in the landing area Thursday. This is Mission Control Houston.
144:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 144 hours. Apollo 11 is 23,289 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4,361 feet per second. All systems performing well, and the crew still in their rest period. It does not appear likely that we will perform mid-course correction number 5 scheduled for approximately 150 1/2 hours elapsed time. However, a firm decision on this mid-course will not be made for approximately 3 1/2 hours. This is Mission Control, Houston.
145:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 145 hours. Apollo 11 is 25,857 nautical miles from the Moon. Heading toward home at 4338 feet per second. Apollo 11 will leave the Moon's sphere of influence at an elapse time of 148 hours 7 minutes 23 seconds. This is Mission Control, Houston.
146:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 146 hours. We have heard nothing from the crew. We assume they are still asleep, and that sleep period began at about 137 hours, 47 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is 28,421 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at a speed of 4322 feet per second. The decision on mid-course correction number 5 is still tending toward not doing that mid-course, however the decision hasn't been made final, and there will be some additional tracking prior to firming up that decision. At this point it appears that the mid-course path number 5 opportunity would require about 4 to 5 feet per second. By waiting until the opportunity of mid-course correction 6, about 7 feet per second would be required. We do not plan to awaken the crew, at least immediately. Let them continue sleeping. All spacecraft systems continue to look very good to us from the ground. We've completed the change of shift here in mission control. Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth, has relieved Milton Windler, and our capsule communicator is Astronaut Bruce McCandless. At 146 hours, 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
147:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours. The flight surgeon reported a short while ago that the crew appeared still to be sleeping, however, we have seen some signs of activity aboard the spacecraft. We suspect they may be awakening shortly. At the present time Apollo 11 is 30,980 nautical miles from the Moon and the speed is 4308 feet per second. The flight plan for today is relatively quiet and we are continuing to await the crew's own awakening - we don't plan to awaken them from the ground at this time. At 147 hours, 1 minute, this is Mission Control, Houston.
147:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 30 minutes. The flight surgeon reported a short while ago that the Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, appears to be up at this time. Both Armstrong and Collins appear still to be sleeping. At the present time Apollo 11 is 32,253 nautical miles from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 4303 feet per second. Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth has elected to perform the mid-course correction maneuver scheduled at transEarth injection plus 15 hours. That would be at about 150 hours 25 minutes ground elapsed time. The exact time of that mid-course correction is not critical and it could move around somewhat. We expect that it would be a velocity change of about 5 feet per second. We expect there will be some conversation with the crew before too much longer. We'll come back up when we hear from the spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 32 minutes.
147:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours, 39 minutes. The flight surgeon reports that all 3 crew are now awake. We expect to be hearing a Good Morning from the spacecraft before too much longer so we'll stand by for that. We said Good Night to the crew last night at about 137 hours, and 47 minutes so they have apparently had a good 10-hour rest period and we'll probably be getting a crew status report indicating just how much sleep each of the crewmen got. We'll stand by for any conversation with the spacecraft.
148:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 7 minutes. In about 24 seconds from now, the spacecraft will pass the imaginary line into the Earth's sphere of influence.
148:13:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours, 21 minutes. At the time the spacecraft crossed from the Moon's sphere of influence to the Earth's sphere of influence, that point at which the Earth is computed as having the dominant influence on the spacecraft trajectory, Apollo 11 was about 33,800 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 174,000 nautical miles from Earth. At the present time, the spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 3994 feet per second with respect to the Earth. After awakening this morning, Neil Armstrong reported all 3 crewmen getting at least 8 hours of sleep. The commander received about - got about 8 hours, the Command Module pilot, Mike Collins, about 8 hours, and Armstrong reported that Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, got about 8 and a half hours of sleep.
148:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 58 minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the crew a few minutes ago was for the mid-course correction number 5. That is scheduled to occur 150 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds. It will be a Reaction Control System burn using the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters. With a velocity change of 4.8 feet per second, and that will be retrograde. Primary purpose of the maneuver will be to adjust the entry conditions which is - would primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a ground elapse time of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured from lunar orbit insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that - before the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and the Moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both bodies. And we would define this as the equal potential point. That will occur at 155 hours 30 minutes. And at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth, 52,543 nautical miles from the Moon. We're now 1 hour 28 minutes 26 seconds from ignition for the mid-course correction 5 maneuver.
149:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours, 41 minutes. We're now about 49 minutes away from the first mid-course correction of this transEarth leg of the Apollo 11 flight. That maneuver will be a 4.8 foot per second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters and is scheduled to occur at a ground elapsed time of 150 hours, 29 minutes, 54 seconds. At this time Apollo 11 is 171,017 nautical miles from the Earth, and the spacecraft velocity is 4,043 feet per second.
149:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 4 minutes. Telemetry data at this time shows the spacecraft in the proper attitude for the upcoming mid-course correction maneuver. The crew will soon be verifying their attitude by taking a sighting on a star through the sextant and will be running some tests on the guidance control system and, the Reaction Control System before the maneuver takes place. That burn now scheduled to come a little over 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 170,102 nautical miles from the Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4058 feet per second.
150:10:00|PAO|One minute until mid-course correction number 5. It will be a 10.9 second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters giving a change of velocity retrograde of 4.8 feet per second. The primary purpose of this maneuver will be to control the spacecraft flight path angle at entry interface. We're now less that 30 seconds from the initiation of the burn.
150:10:00|PAO|They should be burning at this time. And we show the burn off.
150:10:00|PAO|That mid-course correction was performed at a distance of about 169,000 nautical miles from the Earth at a spacecraft velocity of 4075.6 feet per second.
150:35:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours, 35 minutes. Our telemetry data here on the ground shows that a mid-course correction maneuver just about nominal, burn duration 10.5 seconds. Prior to the maneuver, we were predicting a splashdown time of 195 hours, 17 minutes, 25 seconds. And we expect there will be some modification to that after we've had a chance to do some tracking following this mid-course correction maneuver. Apollo 11 is now 168,843 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 4078 feet per second and we're continuing to see a very slow buildup in the Velocity.
151:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 151 hours 11 minutes. The crew is presently setting up the spacecraft for passive thermal control. Once it stabilizes out it will begin a slow roll rate of three revolutions per hour to maintain temperature control. At the present time Apollo 11 is 167,448 nautical miles from the Earth and the velocity is 4,101 feet per second.
151:56:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 9 minutes. At this time, the crew is getting the spacecraft set up to re-initiate the passive thermal control. Apollo 11 currently 165,143 nautical miles from the Earth and traveling at a speed of 4,142 feet per second. The flight plan has relatively few activities scheduled for now through the beginning of the crew sleep period tonight. We do have a television transmission scheduled. I believe, the time on that is a little after 8:00 PM Central Daylight Time. And we show the sleep period to begin at about 160 hours ground elapsed time, or a little less than 8 hours from now. We'll continue to stand by for any conversation with the crew. It has been relatively quiet for a good part of today. We'll stand by for a call from the Capcom or from the spacecraft down to the ground.
151:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 29 minutes. In the process of reestablishing the passive thermal control with the spacecraft in a slow rotation, we have apparently lost high gain lock on and we expect that the crew will reacquire lock with the antenna once the passive thermal control is reestablished. At the present time Apollo 11 is 164 thousand 320 nautical miles from the Earth and the velocity is up now to 4 thousand 156 feet per second. We'll continue to stand by here for reacquisition of the spacecraft, for reestablishment of high gain lock on.
152:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 153 hours, 7 minutes. At the present time, we are changing shifts here in Mission Control. Flight Director Gene Kranz will be coming on to relieve Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be astronaut Charlie Duke. There will be a change of shift briefing in the news center, in the building 1 auditorium in about 10 minutes. At the present time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of 4,185 feet per second. The spacecraft is about 162,700 nautical miles from the Earth. During the change of shift briefing, we will take the circuit down. Record any conversation that develops with the spacecraft and play it back following the change of shift briefing. At 153 hours, 9 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
153:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 153 hours 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11, homeward bound, is now 161,015 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now 4,216 feet per second. Some 3 1/2 minutes of recorded air-to-ground transmissions have accumulated during the recent Change of Shift Press Conference here in Apollo News Center. Let's play that tape back now.
153:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still no explanation, the weird noises emanating from Apollo 11, if indeed it is from Apollo 11 and it's reported from network that it's being received on the downlink at two different stations in the Manned Space Flight Network. Perhaps it will all shake out later in the mission as to what these strange noises are. We'll come back up again as conversation is resumed with Apollo 11 now 160,410 nautical miles out from Earth traveling at 4228 feet per second. At 154 hours, 5 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
154:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 154 hours, 53 minutes ground elapsed time. 40 hours, 9 minutes to entry. Apollo 11 homeward bound 158,378 nautical miles out from Earth velocity now 4267 feet per second. We have some 3 minutes of tape accumulated over the past half hour of minor conversations with the crew of Apollo 11. We'll roll these tapes now.
154:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That completes, the accumulation of air-to-ground communications by means of tape recordings on the last half hour or so. It's quiet right now. No conversation going on between Spacecraft Communicator Charlie Duke and the crew of Apollo 11. And at 154 hours, 57 minutes ground lapsed time this is Apollo Control.
155:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 155 hours, 27 minutes ground elapsed time. Coming up now about 3 minutes away from tonight's television pass. It'll be through the 85-foot antenna at the Goldstone tracking station. The 210 foot dish out there is tied up tracking one of the Mars fly-by missions. We have some 20 seconds of tape accumulated. We'll play that back and rejoin the conversation line.
155:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control still standing by for the incoming television signal from Columbia. Still nothing but the color bar test pattern as of now. Continuing to stand by on air-to-ground and television links.
155:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. While we're waiting for the television pictures to come in, we have in the control room here a vase full of long-stemmed red roses, the card saying, "To one and all concerned. Job superbly done. From a Moonstruck Canadian." Continuing to stand by as we wait for the pictures to come from Columbia. Here they come.
155:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still up live with the air-to-ground circuit to Apollo 11 homeward bound. Now in the passive thermal control mode, or barbecue mode, Charlie Duke is going to make another call to the crew. Let's listen in, in a moment. He's discussing with Flight Director Deke Frank, who tonight is spelling Gene Kranz on this shift, although Gene is here. They're discussing some adjustments to the passive thermal control mode. Apollo 11 has left the Moon some 53,666 miles behind it. And relative to the Moon, Apollo 11 is traveling now at 4306 feet per second. Continue to monitor air-to-ground here till the crew settles down. They're not scheduled to go into their rest period until about another 4 hours from now.
155:57:00|PAO|This is Delta Launch Control. We have postponed the launch of the Delta vehicle tonight. The launch of INTELSAT 3, 24 hours. The reason for this postponement is to examine the second stage propellant ground equipment. There is a slight chance that the acid used in the second stage for an oxidizer inhibited red fuming nitric acid, could have contained an excessive level of contaminants. This possibility is the most that there is a desire to make the examination. During fueling today, it was noticed that the transfer of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid took longer than expected, or longer than normal. In examining the ground equipment, it was found that a filter element had dislodged and had traveled approximately 2 feet into the line. There is need now to insure, that in fact, the displacement of this filter was what caused the slowdown and also a need now to analyze the IRFNA, or inhibited red fuming nitric acid to insure that no contamination is evident. The launch has been rescheduled for 24 hours from now, or 24 hours from 10:00 PM tonight. This has been cleared with the range. We have the same launch window tomorrow night. 10:00 PM to 11:10 PM. This is Delta Launch Control.
155:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apparently, there will be little conversation in the next half hour or so. Apollo 11 now 155,000 as you were - Yes, 155,906 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 4,316 feet per second. And at 156 hours 6 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
156:09:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. After first saying that there would be very little conversation, it seems there's quite a flurry of conversation between the ground and Apollo 11. Let's play back tapes and catch up and go live.
156:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Things are beginning to quieten down aboard Apollo 11 as they get nearer their sleep period. There probably won't be too many more exchanges between spacecraft communicator Charlie Duke here in Mission Control and the crew aboard Columbia. Entry countdown clock now showing 37 hours 53 minutes this may be refined a
156:55:00|PAO|few times between now and splash time, or entry. Apollo 11 now is 153 thousand and 80 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 4 thousand 3 hundred 73 feet per second. And at 157 hours 10 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
158:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 158 hours, 1 minute ground elapsed time. There's been a certain amount of conversation between Charlie Duke here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. We'll play back the accumulated tape at this time and then rejoin the conversation when it does resume on a live basis. Let's roll the tape now.
158:36:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had no communications with Apollo 11 in the last several minutes. So, at this time, 158 hours 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, we will take down the circuit and come back up when and if conversation resumes prior to the time the crew starts their rest period, which tonight is scheduled for 10 hours. 158 hours 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
159:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 159 hours 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew is giving their final report prior to their starting their 10 hour rest period. We've got a little accumulation of tape, then we'll join live. Let's roll the tape now.
159:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Crew of Columbia at this time should be getting ready to start their 10-hour rest period after having been tucked in by spacecraft communicator Charlie Duke here in mission control. At 160 hours 10 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
161:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 161 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. The crew of Columbia is now in a 10 hour sleep period. The official time they went to sleep according to the surgeon, Dr. Cannon Biers is 160 hours, 42 minutes ground elapsed time, almost an hour ago. The Columbia now is 141,369 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 1,628 feet per second. Entry clock now showing 33 hours, 34 minutes to entry or 400,000 feet altitude. Here at Mission Control the black team of flight controllers headed up by Glen Lunnie is moving in to take over for the next eight hours or so. Spacecraft communicator, Charlie Duke will be replaced by Ron Evans, who just entered the room. And at 161 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
162:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 162 hours, 28 minutes. The Apollo 11 spacecraft Columbia is 138,674 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 4692 feet per second. Spacecraft weight, 26,000 pounds. Flight director Glen Lunney has just completed a status check with all of the flight controllers here, has gotten very good reports from all of them. The retrofire office here reports that on the present trajectory, Columbia's entry angle is minus 6.56 degrees. The nominal entry angle is minus 6.51 degrees. Retro expects entry velocity to be 36,194 feet per second. He calls these entry conditions excellent. The flight dynamics officer says that tracking is looking very good. Guidance navigation control officer reports the passive thermal control stable, operating very well. Reaction Control System looking very good. ECOMM, the electrical environmental communications office reports cryogenics well balanced. The environmental control system looking good. All of the antennas and the power status in good shape. And, the flight surgeon reports the crew sleeping soundly. His data indicates all three crewmen were asleep by 160 hours, 42 minutes, and he reports they have taken no medication. In recovery reports, the weather looks very good in recovery area, and all conditions there are ready for a successful recovery. This is mission control at Houston.
163:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 163 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 135,920 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,758 feet per second. The crew's been asleep almost three hours now. All systems still performing welt. This is mission control Houston.
164:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 164 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 133,131 nautical miles from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4827 feet per second. Crew is asleep. Performance of all systems continues to be normal. We're 30 hours 34 minutes 37 seconds away from entry of Apollo 11 into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.
165:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 165 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 130,306 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 4,900 feet per second. Crew is still asleep and all systems are still performing well. This is Mission Control, Houston.
166:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 166 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 127,431 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 4975 feet per second. Crew still sleeping, all systems still normal. The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported today that weather conditions for the landing of Apollo 11 tomorrow expected to be acceptable. Some showers have been reported near the landing area, but these are expected to move westward, leaving the recovery area with partly cloudy skies, east-north easterly winds 10 to 15 knots and 4-foot seas. Although tropical storms will not affect weather in the landing area, the Apollo 11 crew should get a good view of the tropical storm Viola, located in the western North Pacific, and also the remains of the tropical storm Claudia, located southeast of Hawaii. This is Mission Control, Houston.
167:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 167 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 124,520 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 5055 feet per second. All still going well aboard Apollo 11 maintaining a stable passive thermal control mode, nose pointed toward the Earth, rotating 3 revolutions per hour. This is Mission Control, Houston.
168:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 168 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 121,505 nautical miles, velocity 5138 feet per second. All systems are performing well. The crew is still asleep. Clock here in the Control Center shows 26 hours, 34 minutes, 37 seconds until entry into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.
169:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 169 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 118,542 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 5225 feet per second. The crew is still asleep, the performance of all systems continues to be normal. mid-course correction number 6, which was scheduled for an elapsed time of 172 hours, has been canceled. The trajectory is such that it will not be required. From the Manned Space Flight Network we have a contribution to the Apollo 11 mission from a 10 year old boy in Guam. The Guam tracking station is receiving telemetry from this mission and had a problem with one if its antennas - a bearing. The bearing was replaced with the assistance of a 10 year old boy named Greg Force who had an arm small enough that he could work through a 2 and a half inch diameter hole to pack the new bearing. We're now showing entry interface with the Earth's atmosphere 25 hours 33 minutes 30 seconds from now, and the Green Team of flight controllers, led by Cliff Charlesworth, is now taking over from Glynn Lunney and his Black Team of flight controllers. This is Mission Control Houston.
170:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours 28 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that all three crew members probably are still sleeping. And there are no immediate plans to awaken them at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 115,470 nautical miles from the Earth and the speed is up to 5,317 feet per second. In about 4 hours 174 hours 24 minutes ground elapsed time, Apollo 11 will be in terms of distance half way home. At that point it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Moon, and 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth. All systems on the spacecraft continue to function normally at this time. The spacecraft weight is almost an even 26,000 pounds. At 170 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
170:54:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours and 54 minutes. The flight surgeon reported a few minutes ago that telemetry data now indicates all three crewmen are awake after about 10 hours of rest. We expect we will be hearing from them shortly. Apollo 11 at this time is 114,146 nautical miles from here and the spacecraft velocity is 5359 feet per second. A press conference with the principal investigators for lunar samples is scheduled to begin in about 4 or 5 minutes and during that press conference we will tape record any conversation with the crew and play them back following. And 170 hours, 55 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
172:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 20 minutes. During the press conference we established contact with the crew. Capsule Communicator Owen Gary had put in a call at 171 hours about 10 minutes after the surgeon reported biomedical data showed all three crewmen awake. Neil Armstrong responded and we have received a status report from the crew and we also passed up the information, preliminary information, that they will use in the reentry tomorrow and gave them a weather report for the prime recovery area in the Pacific, the landing zone. We will play back about 12 minutes of taped conversation that we have accumulated to date and then stand by for any further live comments from the spacecraft.
172:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 38 minutes. Apollo 11 now 108,669 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 5534 feet per second.
173:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours, 18 minutes. There are virtually no flight plan activities scheduled at this time. The spacecraft systems all continue to perform normally, and at the present time, Apollo 11 is 106,482 nautical miles from the Earth, and velocity is 5607 feet per second. At 174 hours, 24 minutes the spacecraft will be approximately half way between the Earth and the Moon in terms of distance, and it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth and the same distance from the Moon. The spacecraft weight at this time is 26,000 pounds.
173:20:00|PAO|Owen Garriott is the capsule communicator here in mission control at this time.
173:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours 43 minutes. Apollo 11 now 115,165 nautical miles from Earth, the velocity continuing to increase gradually at 5652 feet per second. The cabin temperature in the spacecraft has been running around 62 degrees and coming up within the next hour Apollo 11 will be crossing the midway point in distance, that to occur at 174 hours 24 minutes and 7 seconds. There will be a briefing at 3:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time in the Building 1 Auditorium on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.
173:51:00|PAO|That last comment came from Mike Collins referring Al Bean who is the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 12.
174:11:00|PAO|Astronaut Bruce McCandless has just relieved Owen Garriott as Capsule Communicator. At 174 hours 14 minutes Apollo 11 is 103,440 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 5713 feet per second.
174:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 35 minutes. Apollo 11 now 102,286 nautical miles from Earth and we have crossed the halfway point in terms of distance at 174 hours and 24 minutes and 7 seconds. The briefing on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory is scheduled to begin at MSC in Building 1. We'll tape record any conversations with the spacecraft and play those back immediately following the press conference. This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 36 minutes.
175:42:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 175 hours, 42 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 98,512 nautical miles from the Earth. The velocity, 5892 feet per second. During the preceding press conference, we accumulated about 7 minutes of taped conversation which we'll play back for you now.
175:42:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the tape recorded conversation. We'll continue to stand by for any further communications with the spacecraft. During the previous conversations you heard Mike Collins toss a couple of good-natured bobs at Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth. Collins was Capsule Communicator on Charlesworth's shift during the Apollo 8 mission. At 175 hours, 51 minutes Apollo 11 is 98,034 nautical miles from the Earth.
175:22:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 176 hours 44 minutes. Apollo 11 now 94,961 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity has just gone over the 6,000 foot per second mark. We're 6,029 feet per second. The next item scheduled on the flight plan is a television transmission. That's scheduled to occur at ground elapsed time of 177 hours 30 minutes, which would be 6:02 PM Central Daylight Time. Among the clocks counting down or up to and from significant events here in Mission Control. We have one counting down to entry. That clock now shows 18 hours 18 minutes and 12 seconds until entry. Reentry is scheduled to begin based on no further mid-course corrections at 195 hours 3 minutes 5 seconds. At this time, it appears that mid-course correction 7, if it were done, would only require 0.2 of a foot per second, and based on current tracking, we wouldn't expect to have to mid-course correction 7, although the tracking will be continued and a decision on mid-course correction 7 will not be made - until closer to the time of the maneuver.
177:07:00|PAO|And this is Apollo Control at 177 hours 11 minutes. Our network controller advises that we're starting to get some semblance of TV signal from the spacecraft. We suspect that we may be getting some checkout. We'll continue to stand by and be prepared to take whatever's happening.
177:07:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The network controller now reports that the TV signal is down. Apparently having been turned off and we suspect that what we have is a test of the system by the crew. The television transmission from the spacecraft is scheduled to begin at 177 hours 30 minutes or about 2 minutes past 6, Central Daylight time. At the present time Apollo 11 is 93 thousand 2 hundred 18 nautical miles from the Earth.
177:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 30 minutes. We're standing by at this time to receive television pictures from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. A short while ago we received the test transmission and apparently everything is functioning normally. We were receiving television signal from Goldstone relayed on through to Houston. We'll continue to stand by for the TV.
177:32:00|PAO|We have black and white signals. We should have the conversion up shortly.
177:42:00|PAO|That brief view of the Earth came from 91 thousand 3 hundred 71 nautical miles out in space. After a brief and sincere and moving transmission from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 177 hours 45 minutes.
178:22:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in the Mission's Control room of Mission Control Center the white team of flight controllers under Flight Director Gene Kranz settling in for the 10 hour shift ahead until 5:00 A.M. Green team Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth is now enroute to the Houston Apollo News Center and shortly will be there for his Change of Shift Press Conference estimating about 10 minutes for his arrival. We'll continue to monitor the Apollo 11 air-to-ground circuit should the communications resume. Standing by 178 hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
178:22:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11 now 88,442 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at a velocity of 6299 feet per second. Change of Shift Press Conference with green team Flight Director Cliff Charlesworth due to begin any moment now in the NASA Apollo News Center Auditorium. And at 178 hours, 34 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
179:09:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 179 hours, 9 minutes ground elapsed time. During the past half hour there have been some exchanges between the spacecraft communicator Bruce McCandless here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. One item they're trying to sort out and troubleshoot some difficulties with the biomedical sensors attached to the chest of Command Module Pilot Mike Collins. Let's play back the accumulated tape and hopefully by the time it's ended, we will have picked up communications again and we'll rejoin the conversation live. Roll tape please.
179:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia now 85,198 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching Earth at a velocity of 6443 feet per second. Still standing by for resumption of air-to-ground communications which may be difficult in as much as CAPCOM is leaving the room. We'll continue to monitor air-to-ground as the crew prepares for they're pre-sleep checklists, sets up the passive thermal control mode and sacks out for about a 10-hour rest period in preparation for tomorrow's entry and subsequent recovery in the mid-Pacific aboard the carrier Hornet now hove-to on the aiming point or near the aiming point. Standing by at 179 hours, 27 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
179:44:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Columbia now 82,972 nautical miles out from Earth traveling inbound at 6,546 feet per second. There has been no further communications with the crew of Apollo 11 in the last half hour or so. At this time they should be going through their pre-sleep check list or possibly their evening meal before beginning a 7 hour rest period. We'll take down the circuit at this time and come back when and if the conversation resumes prior to - the time the crew begins their rest period. At 180 hours 03 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
180:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 180 hours 25 minutes ground elapsed time. We have some 4 minutes accumulated tape in recent transmission between Columbia and the ground. We'll roll these tapes at this time.
180:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The weird noise has been reported by network controllers as not being on the down link from the spacecraft. Now it's stopped. Lets leave the circuit open here in the period prior to the time the crew goes to sleep and monitor the air ground circuit.
181:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've been standing by now for quite some time for resumption of communications but apparently no one is saying anything tonight. Apollo 11 now 78,134 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching at 6785 feet per second. And at 181 hours, 17 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
181:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had one brief communication from Apollo 11. Spacecraft Communicator Bruce McCandless is out of the room, the Assistant Flight Director Chuck Lewis went down to the console to talk. Let's play that tape back and rejoin live when the conversation picks up again.
181:27:00|PAO|I stand corrected. That's Charlie Duke on the Capcom slot. Bruce McCandless on the last half hour has been relieved. Charlie is likely to respond. Now he's putting on his headset. We'll listen in.
181:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. To recap briefly, the conversation a few moments ago between Charlie Duke and the crew of Columbia. Because of forecast thunderstorms in the prime recovery area in the mid-pacific for tomorrow the Apollo Spacecrafts lifting capabilities will be used to stretch the entry path some 215 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a new landing point, aiming point with the very rough preliminary coordinates of 13 degrees 19 minutes north by 169 degrees 10 minutes west. These numbers will be refined through the night as retrofire officer exercises the computer and comes up with more definitive numbers. These will be passed on as they are available. Apollo 11 now 75 thousand 9 hundred 51 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6 thousand 8 hundred 99 feet per second. At 181 hours 50 minutes and standing by on the air ground circuit this is Apollo Control.
181:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. All good nights having been said, the crew of Apollo 11 is now preparing to get their 10 hours rest and their last night in space. Here in the Control Center one of the 10 by 10 Eidophor television projectors - a drawing has been projected on the screen ribbing Capcom Charlie Duke for his slight error yesterday on the television pass where he mistook the Moon for Earth. It has the spacecraft midway between the Moon and Earth and it says, "Neil, I just spotted a continent on the Moon. Charlie, the camera's on Earth now." Apollo 11 now 74,906 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6954 feet per second. And at 182 hours, 6 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
182:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 182 hours 10 minutes ground elapsed time. We thought that was all the air-to-ground for tonight prior to the crew going to sleep, but just a few moments ago, there was a brief exchange reporting to Apollo 11 crew that the McDonald Observation or West Texas had the spacecraft in their telescope field of view. Let's roll that tape now and then shut it down again.
183:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 183 hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time. Columbia spacecraft, now - 69,520 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at 7,262 feet per second. Crew now in their rest period. Started their sleep period a little over an hour ago. To reiterate the change in landing point, this is a weather avoidance situation where thunder storms are forecast for the landing point - the original landing point in the Pacific, therefore, after the normal entry interface the lifting characteristics of the Apollo Command Module will be used to extend entry range some 250 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a preliminary aiming point, that is the aiming point may shift around between now and entry which is some 11 hours, 36 minutes from now. But at any rate the aiming point as calculated now is some 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, by 169 degrees 10 minutes west longitude. The preliminary time of drogue decline is 195 hours, 12 minutes. As you were - yes 195 hours, I2 minutes, 4 seconds. And the net extension of - over the earlier splash time is something like 40 seconds. At 183 hours, 27 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
185:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 185 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 9 hours 33 minutes until entry. Crew is still asleep at this time, scheduled to wake up at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time, some 3 and one half hours from now. We've had no word from the crew since the scheduled sleep period began. Apollo 11 now 61,034 nautical miles out from the Earth, and velocity of 7815 feet per second. At 185 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
186:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 186 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 8 hours 35 minutes to entry. Crew of Columbia still asleep at this time. Some 2 and a half hours away from wakeup time at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Because of weather avoidance in the prime recovery zone in the mid-Pacific, southwest of Hawaii, it has been decided some time ago to shift the landing point - aiming point - some 215 nautical miles downrange from the pre-mission aiming point. And all the numbers concerned with entry and post-entry events have been generated, and we shall forward them at this time. Pencils ready? Command Module-Service Module separation, 194:48:07 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:20:08 Central Daylight Time; entry interface, that's 400,000 feet above the Earth's surface, Ground Elapsed Time 195:03:07, 11:35:08 Central Daylight Time; begin blackout, 195:03:25 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:35:26 Central Daylight Time; 05G, 195:03:35 GET, 11:35:36 CDT; end of blackout, 195:06:56 GET, 11:38:57 CDT; drogue parachutes deploy, 195:12:04 GET, 11:44:05 CDT; main parachutes deploy, 195:12:52, 11:44:53 CDT; touchdown, 195:17:49 GET, 11:49:50 CDT. Maximum G-1oading to be pulled during the entry phase will be 6.12G's. Entry velocity, that's at entry interface of 400,000 feet, will be 36,194 feet per second. Flight path angle, minus 6.5 degrees. Aiming point location, 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, 169 degrees 09 minutes west longitude. At 186 hours 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
187:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo control 187 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time. 7 hours, 34 minutes to entry. Flight surgeon Ken Beers reports that all three crew members are sleeping soundly at this time. Their sleep period will end probably at 189 hours although they may sleep an additional hour to 190 hours. Spacecraft being tracked now through the Guam station. A line projected out from Earth to what is called a sub-satellite point or a point directly under the spacecraft would put it over dead center of Australia. At 187 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo control.
188:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 188 hours, 28 minutes ground elapse time. Apollo 11 now 46,254 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity continuing to increase, now 9,081 feet per second. There will be a dramatic increase in velocity as the spacecraft gets closer in. Here in Mission Control Center the entry team headed up by Flight Director Milt Windler is beginning to come aboard. Hand over in progress from Gene Kranz white team. The crew is still asleep at this time. They're some 6 hours, 34 minutes from entry interface. And at 188 hours, 29 minutes ground elapse time, this is Apollo Control.
188:43:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 43 minutes. Mid course correction number 7 has been canceled, and we will add one hour of rest time to the flight plan. Crew will be awakened at 190 hours elapsed time. To repeat, we have canceled mid course correction number 7 and we will allow the crew to sleep until 190 hours elapsed time. This is mission control Houston.
189:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 189 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 40,961 nautical miles from the Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 9,671 feet per second. Mid course correction number 7 has been canceled and as a result we will let the crew sleep until an elapsed time of 190 hours. Weather in the recovery area. Well we're getting a call from Apollo 11, now. Let's listen to that.
189:28:00|PAO|The crew gave us a call at 189 hours, 29 minutes. We advised them of the cancellation of the mid course correction. Weather in the recovery area - skies will be partly cloudy. Cloud base is at 2,000 feet scattered. Wind, east north east at 18 knots. 6 foot sea. Temperature 80 degrees. This landing area is 215 miles to the northeast from the original landing area, moved because of thunder showers in the original area. This new location should allow the recovery ship USS Hornet to arrive in Hawaii 4 to 5 hours earlier than originally planned. We expect that it may be possible for the carrier to arrive at Pearl Harbor somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock, on July 26, that's Saturday.
189:28:00|PAO|The crew is probably preparing breakfast now and it's not likely that we'll hear a lot from them right away, but we'll continue to stay up alive for any conversation.
189:28:00|PAO|Visibility in the recovery area is 10 miles.
189:28:00|PAO|Clock shows we are 5 1/2 hours away from entry interface the point at which Apollo 11 will enter the Earth's atmosphere. That's scheduled to occur at an elapsed time of 195 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds. We expect landing at 195 hours, 17 minutes, 49 seconds.
189:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11 is now 38,793 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 9,947 feet per second.
189:52:00|PAO|- - headed up by flight director Milt Windler is beginning to come aboard, handover and progress from Gene Kranz, white team. Crew still asleep at this time. Some 6 hours, 34 minutes from entry interface. And, at 188 hours, 29 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo control.
189:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 190 hours, 10 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth, 36,956 nautical miles. Velocity, 10,195 feet per second.
190:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo. Control at 190 hours, 34 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth 34,622 nautical miles, velocity 10,534 feet per second.
190:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 190 hours 56 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth 32,447 nautical miles; velocity 10,876 feet per second.
191:07:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours, 15 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 30,469 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 11,221 feet per second.
191:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours 38 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth now 27,979 nautical miles, velocity 11,689 feet per second.
191:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 2 minutes. This will be first time in Apollo that crews have flown lift vector UP during reentry. Normally, lift vector is down. However, we want to extend the range by 215 miles so for a short period about a minute and 25 seconds during the blackout period the spacecraft will be flown with lift vector up. The computer program for that is number 65, up control. Apollo 11 is now 25,301 nautical miles from Earth, velocity has increased to 12,263 feet per second.
192:03:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 30 minutes. Apollo 11 now 22,130 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 13,053 feet per second. We're 2 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds away from entry interface.
192:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 48 minutes. Apollo 11 is 19,914 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 13,695 feet per second. We're 2 hours, 14 minutes, 16 seconds away from entry into the atmosphere, the U.S. Air Force C-135 crew will attempt to photograph this re-entry of the Command Module. Aircraft designated A-1ots for airborne light-weight optical tracker system will attempt to record the entry on 70-millimeter still film. Pilot of that aircraft is the ARIA Squadron Commander. Three of his ARIA Aircraft will be in the entry area to provide communications during re-entry of the Command Module. Crew of ALOTS includes the Commander, Colonel Robert W. Hoffman of Wichita Falls, Texas. The pilot who is the ARIA Squadron Commander Colonel Oakley W. Baron of Kankakee, Illinois, Co-Pilot Lt. Col. Wallace L. Emory, San Angelo, Texas. Navigators are Lt. Col. Ervin O. Stewart, Jr., Greensboro, North Carolina, and Major Charles W. Hinton, Mt. Auburn, Illinois. The photographic Specialist Master Sergeant Paul T. Swieczkowski whose home town is not listed. Col. Baron's nickname is the Red Baron who is a veteran of more than 10,000 flying hours, and has flown more than 80 different types of aircraft.
192:33:00|PAO|Normally the mission Control Center here in Houston will not attempt to contact Apollo 11 after drogue chute deployment. We will stay off the air and let the recovery forces attempt to establish voice contact. If for some reason, Capcom does want to communicate with the crew, he will request clearance from the recovery forces before putting in a call.
192:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 55 minutes. A few of the entry event times have changed from a second to 4 seconds. Others remain the same. Here's the updated times: entry, 195 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds; begin blackout, 195:03:25, 05g 195:03:36; end blackout, 195:07:00; drogue shoot deployment, 195:12:08; main shoot deployment, 195:12:56; landing 195:17:53. Maximum G load expected during the entry, 6.20.

194:13:00|PAO|Helo number 64 is designated Swim Two.
194:13:00|PAO|If that helicopter than Swim One to the landing point swimmers will be deployed from Swim Two to attach the collar. Those swimmers are LtJG Wesley T. Chesser of Arlington, Virginia, QM3 Michael G. Mallary of Alderwood Mannor, Washington, and SN John M. Wolfram of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. The Helo's crew consists of pilot Lt. Richard J. Barrett of Squannanoa, North Carolina, copilot Lt. George Ro. Conn, Imperial Beach, California, AWH2 Curtis E. Hill, Black Rock Arkansas, and AWH2 Richard B. Seaton, Hibbing, Minnesota.
194:28:00|PAO|Apollo 11's distance now 5411 nautical miles; velocity 22,642 feet per second.
194:28:00|PAO|Distance 3896 nautical miles; velocity 24,915 feet per second.
194:28:00|PAO|And we're about 10 minutes away from the scheduled separation time now.
194:28:00|PAO|Apollo 11's distance now is 3000 nautical miles; velocity 26,685 feet per second. In the next 20 minutes Apollo 11 will add almost 10,000 feet per second to that figure.
194:43:00|PAO|Technical difficulties have interrupted the radio-TV news pool feed from the carrier USS HORNET and also the news-writers copy feed from that ship.
194:43:00|PAO|Guidance Officer reports the Command Module computer looks good and the guidance and navigation system is GO aboard the spacecraft.
194:43:00|PAO|We are awaiting confirmation of separation. We confirm separation now from on the ground readings from telemetry. We confirm separation.
194:43:00|PAO|Altitude 1288 nautical miles, velocity 31,232 feet per second.
194:53:00|PAO|Flight Director, Milt Windler, has just informed recovery "We're on the final for the carrier."

194:53:00|PAO|Apollo 11 lined up right down the middle of the entry corridor. Velocity's now 35,578 feet per second. We're a minute and 45 seconds from entry. Black out will begin 18 seconds after entry.
195:01:00|PAO|36,000 feet per second.
195:01:00|PAO|We're at entry time. Blackout very shortly. Range to go to splash 1533 nautical miles. There's blackout. This blackout period should last for about 3 minutes 45 seconds. At blackout we were showing velocity 36,237 feet per second. Range to go to splash 1510 nautical miles. The elapse time for end of blackout 195 hours 7 minutes even. Drogue shoot deployment time is 195 hours 12 minutes 8 seconds. And the Control Center will not attempt to communicate with Apollo 11 after drogue deploy time. It will leave the air ways clear for the recovery forces.
195:01:00|PAO|ARIA 3 reported a visual contact.
195:01:00|PAO|We're at 3 minutes 20 seconds since entry, and the blackout should end about 3 minutes 53 seconds after entry. We're about 11 minutes away from landing. ARIA 3 would - is the up range ARIA aircraft.
195:01:00|PAO|The Hornet reports Air-Boss 1 has visual contact.
195:01:00|PAO|The Hornet now reports a visual contact. Visual contact from the recovery ship.
195:01:00|PAO|Hornet reports momentary visual contact has now disappeared behind clouds.
195:10:00|PAO|We're 7 minutes, 44 seconds from entry. Drogue shoot deployment scheduled for an elapsed time for an entry of 9 minutes, 1 second.
195:10:00|PAO|Hawaii rescue 2 reports an S-band contact with the spacecraft.
195:10:00|PAO|Apollo 11 reports right on. We take that to mean that the drogues deployed on time.
195:10:00|PAO|Apollo 11 should be on main chutes now. Hornet reports a sonic boom a short time ago. We're just under 4 minutes to landing. We will continue to monitor for any conversations between the spacecraft and recovery forces, but we will not initiate a call from now on for the spacecraft from the Control Center.
195:10:00|PAO|Hornet has voice contact. Aircraft reports visual with 3 full chutes.
195:10:00|PAO|Hornet reports spacecraft right on target point.
195:10:00|PAO|That's Neil Armstrong giving the position report.
195:10:00|PAO|Stable 2 is upside down. The flotation bags will right the spacecraft.
195:10:00|PAO|It normally takes 8 to 10 minutes for the rotation bags to right the spacecraft. Swim 1 is getting ready to deploy swimmers.
195:20:00|PAO|Apollo 11 reported still in stable 2, but gradually righting itself.
195:20:00|PAO|Apollo 11 is stable 1 now, stable 1.

195:53:00|PAO|Hornet now 1 and one-quarter miles from the spacecraft.
195:53:00|PAO|And the Lt. Hatleberg sprayed decontaminate around the hatch.
195:53:00|PAO|And the swimmer now scrubbing down the Command Module with the decontaminate.
195:53:00|PAO|The swimmer has now started scrubbing the astronauts biological isolations garments with the decontaminate.
195:53:00|PAO|Hornet estimates distance three-quarters of a mile now.
195:53:00|PAO|And the first astronaut has been scrubbed down and the swimmer has started the decontaminated processes on the BIG of the second astronaut.
195:53:00|PAO|Scrub down on the second astronaut completed.
195:53:00|PAO|And the third astronaut has been scrubbed down, and now the astronauts are scrubbing down the swimmer.
195:53:00|PAO|The other swimmers will now proceed to the Command Module. It has been decontaminated, and the swimmers will remain on their scuba air.
196:13:00|PAO|And Recovery 1 going in now to pick up the first astronaut.
196:13:00|PAO|Mission Director George Hage has just thanked the flight controllers assembled here in the Control Center on behalf of himself and Gen. Phillips for the way in which they conducted this mission.
196:13:00|PAO|No cigars being lit up here yet. We're waiting until the crew is on the carrier. A few are being wetted in anticipation of a match, but we don't see any lit yet.
196:23:00|PAO|The elevator will take recovery 1 down to the hangar deck and where the crew will enter the mobile quarantine facility. And the flags are waving and the cigars are being lit up. And clear across the big board in front is President John F. Kennedy's message to Congress of May, 1961: I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. That has been accomplished.
196:23:00|PAO|The Apollo 11 plaque has been hung in the mission Control Center - a replica of the crew patch.
196:23:00|PAO|This Control Center becoming jammed with people as - people from the staff support room is coming in here. We've never seen this many people in the Control Center at one time before.
196:23:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The participants in the post-recovery news conference have left the Control Center, and the post-recovery news conference will begin within the next few minutes in the MSC building 1 auditorium.
