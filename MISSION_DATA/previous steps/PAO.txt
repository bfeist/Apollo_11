This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T minus 1 hour 30 minutes 55 seconds and counting. All elements are GO with the countdown at this time, the countdown aimed at landing 2 astronauts on the Moon. At this time the spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin going through some checks with astronaut Mike Collins aboard the spacecraft. We're winding up this important emergency detection system test that Neil Armstrong has been participating in. Meanwhile, at the 320 foot level the closeout crew now placing the boost protective cover over the hatch now that we have completed the cabin purge and have the proper cabin environment inside the cabin. We have also performed leak checks to assure ourselves that the cabin atmosphere is valid. This boost protective cover is used during the early phases of a powered flight and it is jettisoned with the escape tower shortly after second stage ignition. Here in the firing room the launch vehicle test team's still keeping a close eye on the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We're back to 100 percent supply with the liquid hydrogen fuel in the third stage. This problem with the leaking valve is no problem at this time. We've actually bypassed the valve that we are maintaining our hydrogen supply aboard the vehicle. All aspects GO, the weather is very satisfactory this morning, a thin cloud cover about 15,000 feet, temperature at launch time exected to be about 85 degrees. At T minus I hour, 29 minutes, 30 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T minus 1 hour, 20 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All is still GO with the countdown for Apollo 11 at this time. At this point in the countdown Spacecraft Commander Neil Armstrong once again appears to be the busiest worker in the spacecraft as he is performing a series of alignment checks associated with the guidance system in the spacecraft. He is working these checks with the spacecraft test conductor as the test conductor reads out the various procedures and Armstrong responds to them. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft also were informed by the spacecraft conductor a short while ago that the launch vehicle is GO at this time. The hydrogen problem that we did encounter earlier has been solved. That is real good news said Armstrong and then he went back to work shortly thereafter. We are now coming up on the 1 hour, 20 minute mark in the countdown. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T minus one hour, 11 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown for Apollo 11 still going very satisfactorily at this time. In most cases we're a matter of 5 or 10 minutes ahead of the countdown procedures. The crew in the white room at the 10 and 20 foot level who have been aiding the astronauts up to this time are just in the process of finishing up their work. They've been advised by the spacecraft test conductor that they'll probably be able to move out in about 3 minutes or so. Once this is accomplished, once the close-out crew does depart, we'll be ready to move that swing-arm back - swing-arm 9. It will be moved 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch which is about 5 feet away from the hatch. Once this is accomplished, we will arm the pyrotechnic systems in the spacecraft so in the event of a possible catastrophic condition below them, the launch vehicle, while still on the pad, the astronauts could fire that escape rocket and separate from the rocket in difficulty. The close-out crew are about to depart at this time. That swing-arm remains about 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch as mentioned - 5 feet or so until the 5-minute mark in the count when it's fully retracted to it's fall-back position. The obvious reason here is in the event we do have to get the astronauts out in a hurry, the swing-arm is in a stand-by position and could be moved rapidly back to the hatch - to the hatch level so the astronauts could depart in the event of an emergency. We're coming up on T minus 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 20 seconds. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. T-61 minutes and counting - T-61 minutes on the Apollo 11 countdown, and all elements are GO at this time. Astronaut Neil Armstrong has just completed a series of checks on that big service propulsion system engine that sits below him in the stack. We want to assure ourselves before liftoff that that engine can respond to commands from inside the spacecraft. As Neil Armstrong moved his rotational hand controller we assured ourselves that the engine did respond by swiveling or gimballing. This is - course is important for maneuvers in space. The countdown is still proceeding very satisfactorily other than two minor problems essentially picked up the count at 11 pm eastern daylight time last night, all has gone well. As we approach the one hour mark now, in the count of series of radio frequency and telemetry checks will be in progress with the launch vehicle. We'll also check out the tracking beacons in the instrument unit that travels as a guidance system for the Saturn 5 during the powered phase of flight. Now 59 minutes, 48 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy launch control.

A short while ago, in fact the spacecraft test conductor - we are doing quite well, in fact some 15 minutes ahead on some aspects of the preparation spacecraftwise. Armstrong replied that was fine so long as we don't launch 15 minutes early. I guess they are referring to the start of the window.

Apollo 11 countdown is still GO at this time, all elements reporting ready at this point in the countdown. The spacecraft - correction - the Test Supervisor Bill Schick has advised all hands here in the control center and spacecraft checkout people that in about 30 seconds that big swing arm that has been attached to the spacecraft up to now will be moved back to a parked position some 5 feet away from the spacecraft. We alert the astronauts because there is a little jolt when this arm is moved away. It will remain in that position some 5 feet away from the spacecraft until the 5 minute mark in the count when it's completely pulled away to its retracted position. It's coming up now in 5 seconds, the swing arm will come back. Mark. The swing arm now coming back from the spacecraft. Countdown proceeding satisfactortly, we've completed our telemetry checks with the launch vehicle and at this point with the swing arm back we arm the pyrotechnics so that escape tower atop the astronauts, atop their spacecraft, could be used if a catastrophic condition was going to occur under them with the launch vehicle from this point on down in the countdown. We have the high speed elevator located at the 320 foot level in the event the astronauts have to get out in a hurry. This is a special precaution. One of the members of the support team for Apollo 11, Astronaut Bill Pogue, is here in the firing room. He acts as Capsule Communication during the countdown. His call sign is Stoney. He controls that elevator. He now has it locked at the 320 foot level. These are special precautions for safety purposes during the final phase of the count. Now coming up on the 49 minute in the countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 46-minute mark in our countdown. T minus 45 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. All elements still GO the countdown at this time. The hard work on the spacecraft at this point in the countdown - Astronaut Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat. He's been working with the spacecraft test conductor on setting up proper switch settings in preparation for pressurizing the reaction control system. These are these big thrusters on the side of the service module. There's actually 16 of them in 4 quadrants around the service module. They are used for maneuvers in space. We pressurized that system before liftoff. That particular operation will be coming up in some 5 minutes or so. In preparation for it, Buzz Aldrin who has most of the switches in front of him has been preparing for that particular event. The launch vehicle people keeping an eye on the status of the various propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. Just at liftoff, we will have the vehicle weighing close to 6 and a half million pounds on the launch pad. There's more that a million gallons of propellants aboard the 3 stages of Saturn V. The report here in the control center are the propellants are stable. They did look a little while ago at the RP 1, the high-grade kerosend fuel that's used in the first stage of the Saturn V to make sure it was at it's top level. We keep an eye on these various aspects throughout the count, and use the aid of computers to keep an overall look on general status. So now at T minus 44 minutes, 21 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

There are no problems that have been reported in as the countdown continues to click down. We're still aiming for the start of our window on this, the first flight to land man on the moon. Our - we're aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 9:32 am eastern daylight time. Coming up shortly will be a key test here in the firing room. As far as the launch vehicle people are concerned, it's a - some final checks of the destruct system aboard the three stages of the Saturn-5 launch vehicle. In the event during powered flight that the vehicle strayed rather violently off course, the main safety officer could take action to destroy the vehicle which obviously would occur after the astronauts were separated by their escape tower from the faulty vehicle. We'll make a check of the destruct system to assure that if the signal is required to get through that, in fact, it will. This is what is coming up here in the control center at this time. All aspects of the mission still GO at T-39 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy launch control.

At T minus 30 minutes 52 seconds and counting, aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 32 minutes past the hour, the start of launch window on this the mission to land men on the Moon. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactorily at this time. We've got by an important test with the launch vehicle checking out the various batteries in the 3 stages and instrument unit of the Saturn V. We remain on external power through most of the count to preserve those batteries which must be used during the powered flight. We've just taken a look at them by going internal and then switching back to external again. The batteries all look good. The next time we go internal will be at the 50 second mark with those batteries and they will remain, of course, on internal power during the flight. The lunar module, which has been rather inactive during these latter phases of the count also is going on internal power at this time on the 2 batteries on the ascent stage and the 4 batteries on the descent stage. For the next 20 minutes we will take a look at some systems in the lunar module and then power down at about the 10 minute mark in the count, power down the telemetry to preserve the power of the LM. The lunar module on Apollo 11, of course, when it separates from the command module in lunar orbit, will have the call sign Eagle. The command module call sign, once the 2 vehicles separate, will be Columbia. Both Columbia and Eagle are GO at this time at 29 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

Those are the big thrusters on the side of the service module that are used for maneuvers in space. Each one of these thrusters is capable of 100 pounds of thrust, there are 16 of them located in 4 quadrants around the service module. We pressurize the system with helium prior to launch to make sure that all will be in readiness for use in space. The countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. We picked up at the T minus 9 hour mark at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time last evening. We've just had 2 comparatively minor problems since that time. The major portion of the countdown during the early morning hour some 5 hours of work was taken to load the various propellants aboard the stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. As we came into the count this morning we did already have the fuel aboard the first stage, but it was necessary to bring the liquid oxygen aboard all 3 stages and the liquid hydrogen fuel aboard the second and third stages.

Close to 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants were loaded during these 5 hours. Following that the astronauts, the prime crew, were awakened at 4:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight as planned in their countdown, and proceeded to have their physical examination in which they were declared flight ready. They sat down for the normal astronaut meal on launch day as far as breakfast is concerned, orange Juice, steaks, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. The 3 pilots were joined by 2 of their coleagues at breakfast, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton and the backup command module pilot Bill Anders who has been named the Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The astronauts departed from their crew quarters. After checking out their suits they departed from the crew quarters at 6:27 a.m. and some 27 minutes later and 8 miles away from the crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center a top the launch pad at complex 39, 6:54 a.m. the commander, astronaut Neil Armstrong, was the first aboard the spacecraft. He was followed about 5 minutes later by Mike Collins and finally Buzz Aldrin, the man who is sitting in the middle seat during liftoff, was the third astronaut to come aboard. Two minor problems have been encountered during the count. Early in the count a malfunction light came on here in the control center indicating that we might have a communication problem at the launch pad. Nothing to do with the spacecraft, but it indicated we possibly might not be able to talk to some key technicians we had at the pad. The problem turned out to be very minor, a simple adjustment of some equipment beneath the pad remedied the problem. There was no, in fact, no equipment problem involved. The second problem, we did encounter a leaky valve in part of the equipment that is used to replenish the hydrogen fuel supply on the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. A team of technicians were sent up to the launch pad at about the time the astronauts were traveling to the pad. They tightened some bolts and we were able to bypass this valve and to proceed with our countdown. The weather is certainly GO. It's a beautiful morning for a launch to the Moon. We expect a temperature of about 85 degrees in the Kennedy Space Center area. The wind is about 10 knots from the southeast, and the weather condition in the round-the-world track, according to reports to the Manned Space Flight Meterology group indicate all weather conditions are acceptable for launch. That's our general status. We've Just passed the 22 minute mark in the count. 21 minutes 55 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

The astronauts aboard the spacecraft have had a little chance to rest over the last few minutes or so. At least they have not been busy with procedures with the spacecraft test conductor. In the meantime we have been performing final checks on the tracking beacons and the instrument unit which is used as a guidiance system during the powered phase of flight. Once we get down to the 3-minute and 10-second mark in the countdown, we'll go on an automatic sequence. As far as the launch vehicle is concerned all aspects from there on down will be automatic, run by the ground master computer here in the firing room. This will lead up to the 8.9-minute mark in the countdown when the ignition sequence will begin in those five engines of the first stage, the S-IC stage of Saturn V. At the 2-second mark we'll get information and a signal that all engines are running and at the zero mark in the countdown once we get the commit signal, the signal that says that the thrust is proper and acceptable, we then will get a commit and liftoff as the hold-on arms release the vehicle. We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upwards, a vehicle that weighs close to 6 and one-half million pounds.

CAPCOM
Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking was? Over.

SC
I thought it went pretty well, Houston. Although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turn around maneuver, I went pitch accel command and started to pitch up, and then when I started to pitch up, and then when I put manual attitude pitch back to rate command for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to accel command and hit what I thought was an extra proceed on the DSKY. And during the course of that we drifted slightly further away from the S-IV B than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so, and therefore I expect I used a bit more coming back in. Except for using a little more gas, and I've used a few numbers on that everything went nominally.

This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 11 minutes into the mission. The S4B slingshot maneuver was completed about 5 minutes ago. Designed to put the third stage of the launch vehicle into a trajectory that will take it behind the trailing edge of the moon and then into a solar orbit. The crew did not witness this maneuver. The command was not in the proper attitude where they could see the S-IVB at the time. We've advised the crew that we do not believe that we'll do the first midcourse correction. That we'll wait for midcourse correction 2 tomorrow and expect a DELTA V to be performed in that maneuver of about 21.3 feet per second. We've also had some other brief transmissions including a - comments from Neil Armstrong on the view out the window, and a weather report on the part of the world he can see.

We could see that the weather was good just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good, and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear.

Roger, 0.2. Okay, Mike, and could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in VENT then?

SC
Roger, waste compartment valve has been in VENT for oh I guess 45 minutes or so.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy.

SC
If we're late in answering you, it's because we' re munching sandwiches.

CAPCOM
Roger. I wish I could do the same here.

SC

Down in the control center you might want to join us in wishing Dr. George Mueller a happy birthday.

CAPCOM
Roger. We are standing by for your birthday greetings.

SC
I think today is also the birthday of California and I believe they are 200 years old and we send them a happy birthday. It's Dr. Mueller 's birthday also but I don't think he is that old.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy and looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him.

Would you leave them on there for another second, please?

SC
Will do.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. We copy the angles, but stand by before you go ahead and use them. Over.

SC
Standing by.

Houston, Apollo 11. Torquing angles essentially the same, and we're going to go ahead and torque them now.

CAPCOM
Roger. We concur.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an auto optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?

SC
Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.

CAPCOM
I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star. That roll angle was a little larger than we expected.

Roger.

SC
Houston, Apollo. I've got a CRYO pressure light, and a master alarm. It's reset.

This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 31 minutes. At the present time the spacecraft is 29,363 nautical miles from earth and the velocity continuing to drop off gradually, reading now 11,192 feet per second. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has taken over as Flight Director now from Clifford Charlesworth. Kranz has been reviewing the status of the spacecraft's systems with his team of flight controllers; everything looks very good at this point. The crew has been advised that the mid-course correction 1, the first opportunity for mid-course correction, of which has been scheduled into the flight plan at about 13 hours, 30 minutes will not be performed. A correction of mid-course had been scheduled at 11 hours, 45 minutes into the flight plan and that will not be performed according to the tracking data we have at this time. The crew, up until their sleep period which will begin in about 13 hours, 30 minutes or about 7 hours from now will be involved generally in a routine of housekeeping type activities aboard the spacecraft. At the present time they should be involved in some mid-course navigations. At 6 hours, 32 minutes this is Apollo Control of Houston.

SC
Okay, Charlie, I think we'll just hold right here in the program.

CAPCOM
Roger, we got the DOWN light now, over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to reject the 940, 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again, over.

SC
Okay, will do.

CAPCOM
Okay, Houston, Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the DOWNLINK.

SC
Roger, we see it, stand by.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.

SC
Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you had moved star number 2 to the tail-end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?

CAPCOM
Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TOI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory so go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat a Mark and you get an equivalent size, and we'll have to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size 0. Over.

SC
Okay, we'll do it.

CAPCOM
And, 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots is good. Over.

The crew at this time is involved in midcourse navigation using their onboard optical system. We have completed the changeover in briefing of shifts here in Mission Control, and the crew activities, until the sleep period begins, will consist of housekeeping, functions aboard the spacecraft, changing out carbon dioxide filters. They will not be doing the midcourse correction SC
heduled for 11 hours 45 minutes into the flight as the first opportunity. The change of shift briefing is SC
heduled to begin shortly. Any conversations that develop with the crew during that period of time will be tape recorded and we'll play those back following the change of shift briefing. This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 53 minutes.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, 7 hours, 21 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. During the change of shift briefing, we accumulated about 4 minutes of tape conversation with the spacecraft. That conversation generally related to the onboard batteries, which are currently being charged - a routine operation - and also the midcourse navigation exercise that the crew is currently involved in. We'll play back the tape for you now, and then stand by for any live conversation with the crew.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.

SC
Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.

CAPCOM
Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll diSC
ontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12:25 in the flight plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.

SC
Roger. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.

CAPCOM
Affirm.

SC
And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO OPTICS MANEUVERS or P23's AUTO MANEUVERS don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star. It's our second star.

CAPCOM
Roger. Stand by.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good. 198.6, 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the flight plan. Over.

SC
Okay, and we'll try that.

SC
Charlie, state those 3 angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.

CAPCOM
Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the flight plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 130.7. Over.

SC
Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 4000.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point. I'm having them maneuvered quite a bit, and that's in progress now, so stand by for some more.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy all.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've run the angles given in the flight plan for the P23 attitude through the machines down here and they come up with the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the nonsymmetrical horizon might be giving

Go ahead. Over.

SC
Roger. 44 is Just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant and the star is lost somewhere in there and I can not see it.

CAPCOM
Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.

SC
Yes. I'd appreciate that.

CAPCOM
Hello Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
And, Mike, we think these large Delta-Rs, NOUN 49 you're getting, is really meaningful since it's been . . . TLI since we had a state vector update and we think it's normal. Over.

SC
Okay. Could be Charlie. Some of the area markings I might not have had precisely the sub stellar point. I think as time goes by, they've been coming more accurate but Olean up here is just flat invisible.

CAPCOM
Rog.

SC
Sam Houston, Apollo 11. Understand it's the same 3 gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?

CAPCOM
I'm believe that's right. Stand by 1. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
That is negative. Stand by 1.

SC
Okay, cause it's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program was but with inaccurate state vector I'm inclined not to believe the program.

CAPCOM
Stand by.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. LMB is back on the line.

CAPCOM
Roger. Copy.

SC
Read you bye, bye.

CAPCOM
Roger same, Buzz. And 11, the angles for you are 1978 roll, 1285 pitch, 3400 yaw.

SC
Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P-23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31 and 31365. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy 11. We understand the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles NP-23 and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by we'll look at these - that we see on the DSKY. Over.

SC
Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5 and 340.0.

SC
Okay, I'm going to trim up the attitude here. I'll give it another try.

SC
Okay, I have it loud and clear, now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a horizon count.

CAPCOM
Roger. Stand by.

SC
It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point, however, I'm off quite a bit in roll.

CAPCOM
Roger, we'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.

SC
Okay, fine, but the radial is not parallel to the'horizon. I have to move off quite a bit in order to get it parallel to the horizon.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. Our Procedures guys are saying that the radial does not have to be parallel. Over.

It just appears to me that you have to have a radical. Change it to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else your not at the substellar point here out front, laterally and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.

This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 59 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft altitude is currently reading 42 thousand 7 hundred 53 nautical miles, and we show a velocity of about 91 hundred feet per second. We are in the process now of up linking to the space craft attitude for the passive thermal control mode. Under this mode the spacecraft will be rotated about its X axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperature balance within the spacecraft. The crew has completed the midcourse navigation exercise. They will shortly be aligning the spacecraft stable platform, used as a attitude reference in the guidance system. This is a routine procedure, and following that, the spacecraft will be placed in the passive thermal control mode where normally it would be left during the sleep period. The cabin temperature in the command module, has been running between 65 and 70 degrees. The current spacecraft weight is 96 thousand 4 hundred 60 pounds.

This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 13 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Based on biomedical data, a flight surgeon reports that it appears the crew removed their pressure garments - their pressure suits at about 8:00 PM for. the Commander, Neil Armstrong and Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin apparently got out of his pressure suit about 1 hour earlier or about 7 hours ground elapsed time. The spacecraft is currently 44,529 nautical miles from earth and the velocity has dropped now to 8983 feet per second. We do have, rather poor lock with the spacecraft antenna at this time accounting for the noise on the air to ground circuit. We'll take down the circuit until we reestablish better lock and we'll record any conversations that occur in the interim. At 9 hours, 14 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator. For instance, we kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - we expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to vent does the detent - correction - does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.

flow, as we would have expected at this point. This would indicate that the enrichment of the cabin atmosphere, which was 60 percent oxygen, 40 percent nitrogen at launch and which is normally enriched with pure oxygen during the course of the/flight, is not enriching as rapidly as we would expect. This could be a transducer problem - one of the devices that measuzes the O2 flow rate - or possibly a partial obstruction of one of the vents. The problem is not thought to be significant at this point, and we'll be monitoring the O2 flow during the night.

It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEV, and we - like to mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter, however with that extension they seem to be working pretty good.

This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 29 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We don't expect to hear a great deal more from the crew tonight. At about 11 hours, 20 minutes we said good-night to them from Mission Control and they're beginning their sleep period about 2 hours early. The additional time available for sleep was made available by deleting the mid-course correction. The first opportunity which occurred at 11 hours, 45 minutes. That mid-course correction has been moved to mid-course correction 2 to the opportunity of mid-course correction 2 of which would occur tomorrow. The last conversation we had with the crew, we received a status report and a report that they had taken no medication and were "fit as a fiddle". We also got a report from Mike Collins on the gas separation unit which is being flown on this flight. This consists of 2 stainless steel cylinders about 5 inches long and about an inch to an inch and half in diameter. The cylinders are attached to the water gun or to the water spigot on the food preparation panel and remove the gas from the water that flows through the filter. The filter actually has 2 filters inside. One which attracts water and one which repels it, in the process removing the gas. Mike Collins reported that the filters seem to be working quite well. That the water was coming out almost free of bubbles. He did report that they had a minor problem with a leak at the junction between the food bag and the filter. Mission Control advised that we would give that some thought and try to come up with some solution to it when they wake up tomorrow. At this time, Apollo 11 is 55,522 nautical miles from earth traveling at a velocity of 7920 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 32 minutes.

Roger. We're seeing the center of the earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain but we can clearly see the western coast of North America, the United States, the San Joaquin Valley. The High Sierra's, Baja, California and Mexico down as far as Acapulco and the Yucatan Penninsula and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezeula and Columbia. I'm not sure you'd be able to see all that on your screens down there.

That concludes the unscheduled television transmission. That transmission came in about 2 hours ago at a ground elapsed time of 10:32:40 beginning, lasted about 16 and a half minutes. At the beginning of the transmission Apollo 11 was about 50,980 nautical miles from earth and at the conclusion about 52,248 nautical miles. At the present time, the crew is in a scheduled rest period. They did indicate before going into the rest period, when we last heard from them, that they would probably use part of the time to get a bite to eat and then get some sleep. At this time Apollo 11 is 59,908 nautical miles from earth, traveling at a speed of 7,569 feet per second. At 12 hours 31 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 47 minutes. We've just put in a call to the crew. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, verified with the surgeon that they had not gone to sleep at this point and Capsule Communicator, Charlie Duke, has put in the call. We'll pick up the tape of the converstion and then stand by for any following live communication with the crew.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11; Houston. Hope we aren't disturbing you. We'd like you to terminate the noun 65 now. Over.

SC
Alright.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11; Houston. Over.

SC
Houston; Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
Roger. When you stopped, or correction, when you terminated the noun 65, it appears to us, you get a verb 46 which collapsed the deadband back to 0.5. We're okay as long as you do not turn on any auto RCS select switches. Over.

SC
Okay. I've got that one, Jack. We're ready to ... Roger.

CAPCOM
Roger, verb 34 would have been a better procedure.

SC
Yeah.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. We don't anticipate a great deal of further conversation wit the crew. We expect they will attempt to get some sleep shortly. The converstion that just ended, we advised that through one of the computer programs, the deadband for that area of excursions which the guidance system will allow befor firing the RCS thrusters to correct it. It had been narrowed from 30 degrees to 1/2 a degree. What this would mean, if the RCS jets were enabled, is that unless the crew reselected the 30 degree deadband, the jets would be firing more frequently to keep the spacecraft within the narrower limits. Since the spacecraft is very stable at this point, very few wobbling motions, it was felt that the narrower deadband was acceptable; the jets are not enabled, and the crew would not be disturbed by firing of the Reaction Control System jets even if the spacecraft moved out of the 1/2-degree deadband. In the event of any large excursions, which we would not expect, based on the passive thermal control mode, used in Apollo 10. It would be possible to awaken the crew from the ground and have the situation corrected. We would not expect, however, for the spacecraft attitude to change significantly during the night, and we do intend to continue in the passive thermal control mode as it is presently set up. At this time Apollo 11 is 61,509 nautical miles from earth, traveling at a speed of 7,449 feet per second, which would translate to about 5,000 miles an hour. At 12 hours 54 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgement, put a man on Mars by the end of this Century". Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourists cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Nuberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Alcapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press: London AP: Europe is moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat.

Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular readout in the section. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is proceed on NOUN 87 after you get 2 consecutive measurements equal it will then point 003 degrees, and of course move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today, I'm sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to insure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the section M-1ine, which is the line that runs through the 2 hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-1ine, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual super imposition of the star on the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the section above, below, or on the M-1ine. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after the AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course you can use a -

We've got an auto maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark. Of course, you can use a VERB 94 - that's VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the auto maneuvers. Over.

SC
Roger. Stand by one, we're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.

CAPCOM
Okay.

PAO
Apollo 11 is now going out of the passive thermal control mode in which it was slowly rotating to maintain thermal balance. They're getting set up for the P23 activities. That's the midcourse navigation. Capcom Bruce McCandtess is passing up some changes in the procedures for this navigational operation.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, 11.

SC
Okay, we're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics cal attitude. And we're going to the P23. What I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch and yaw which you give me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was unnecessary.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee strong, why you get that one.

SC
Well - okay - well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M line. Before we started marking for the first time it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make a large attitude changes after that to get the M line parallel, and in some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processer for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know we gotta have the M line parallel.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little, and if you'll stand by a second we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the auto maneuver.

SC
Okay.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

Go ahead, 11.

SC
Registar 3 minus 3 balls 2 4.

CAPCOM
Roger, minus 3 balls, 2 4, and you can go ahead and proceed.

SC
Okay, proceeding at this time.

CAPCOM
11, Houston, after you've completed P52, we'd like the up flight you on state vector, so we can start out clean on this P23, over.

SC
Okay. Houston, are you observing the higher O2 flow on fuel cell 3? Houston, Apollo 11, it triggers the master alarm 3 times now - there it goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4 and then oscilates back down to about 1.1 , over.

CAPCOM
Roger, we saw them 1.3 now, on TM - stand by a second.

SC
And we're through now for state vector.

CAPCOM
Roger, give us accept, please.

SC
Roger.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. On our O2 flow fuel cell 3, apparently it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate is acceptable, over.

SC
Roger, it seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also, over.

Apollo 11, this is Houston, go ahead.

SC
Roger, I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star. What number is it? Star 37, is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, are do you want to go over to Star 40?


END OF TAPE


APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-17-69     CDT 8:56  -  GET 24:24  -  TAPE 90/1

SC
- 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to Star 40?

CAPCOM
Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration and we haven't noticed a VERB 66 yet after our state vector uplink. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
When you move into P-23, we recommend that you use the CMC computer angles for your auto maneuver. See how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-1ine parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-1ine is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.

SC
Yes, I believe.

CAPCOM
Roger. Roger.

PAO
Star 37 is Nunki. Apollo 11 is now in program 52 which is realignment of the platform prior to beginning the cislunar navigation operation.

SC
This is Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a 987 twice in a row of five balls so that's sufficient for a count.

CAPCOM
That's certainly very sufficient.

SC
Okay.

SC
Now I want to go to P00 and I am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point. Okay?

CAPCOM
Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC computed angles for your auto maneuver.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zero?

SC
Not yet.

CAPCOM
Okay.

CAPCOM

SC
No, we haven't changed any cannisters this morning.

CAPCOM
Okay. Then you can plan on accomplishing that after P-23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.

Roger, we copy. And that is for Star Zero 1?

SC
Star Zero 1 right near the horizon. Code 110.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. On this star the auto maneuver works just fine and I am right at the substellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.

CAPCOM
Roger. Is this for Star 01?

SC
That's correct.

CAPCOM
You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?

SC
Well, of course, the earth is pretty bright and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it and the star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horison so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy. Stand by a minute, please.

On our ground computer we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as heing pointed at the star. However, it looks as if that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM so that while you will be getting the earth horizon, the star LOS, is obscured by the LM.

That's right. I - I haven't entered, I gave it back to the computer for a second. I put the Mode Switch from Manual back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight, so the delay here has been in going back to manual and finding the star again which I've finally done, and just a second here, I'll go to enter and get a 51 and mark on it.

Roger. I understand that the Northern Africa - Mediterraanean area is fairly clear today, huh?

SC
Right. I see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down, too.

CAPCOM
Do you find that the monocular is any good to you, Buzz?

SC
Yes. It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. It has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.

SC
There's an anti-cyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of Brazil and some - well, the diameter of it must be over 2,000 miles across.

You all are just beginning to come over the LM now I can see parts of Central America and it looks to be fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, thank you.

That was Buzz Aldrin giving the description of what he could see on the Earth. The backup lunar module pilot Fred Hayes is also in the Control Center at the present time.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, 11.

SC
I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's, oh bright and darker blue except for that region that's about 1/8th of an earth's radius in diameter, and in this circular area the blue of the water turns a grayish color and I'm sure that's where the sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing, It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water and that turns it sort of a grayish color.

SC
Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?

CAPCOM
A lot of gray paint.

CAPCOM
11, Houston.

SC
Go ahead, Houston.

CAPCOM
Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?

SC
Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it,

CAPCOM
How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined where it's no longer hazy?

SC
Yes, we're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the noise.

SC
Hey, Jim.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Buzz.

SC
Looks like the best outstanding view is through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye and then you kind of float up next to it so you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift and you get a better view that way.

CAPCOM
Sounds good.

CAPCOM
How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?

SC
Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's just like being outside except more comfortable.

CAPCOM
It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.

SC
We've been busy, I'm looking -

SC
Say again, my friend?

It sure is nice in here.

Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.

SC
- the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.

CAPCOM
I understand it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Have you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?

SC
No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.

SC
One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.

SC
Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's, I'm not sure, but I think it's a back pressure problem. If the thing sees any back pressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where its almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have it, and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.

CAPCOM
Understand.

SC
In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns when we're moving a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.

CAPCOM
Are the water temperatures good? Are you getting hot water?

SC
Yes, it seems reasonably warm.

SC
We made 3 cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the 3. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it beats stone cold coffee.

SC
Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now. How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain we concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is in fact malfunctioning. I mentioned when you start this through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough, and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now we concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shuting off at about 31 hours    GET to get the O2 concentration in the vehicle up in the vehicles where it will be acceptable for the LM checkout. Over.

Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?

Okay, understand. It's not our monitor, it must be the transmitter or the distance.

Charlie, how far out can you pick up TV on the OMNI?

CAPCOM
Stand by.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI's on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.

SC
Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11; Houston. We got some pipa biases and general drift updates for you if you give us to an accept. Over.

SC
Okay, Charlie. Stand by one.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. The - Okay, thank you much. Our biggest drift on the gyros is 0.03 degrees per hour with only X-gyro. On the pipas, the wide pipa's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so we just kinda tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both gyros and accelerometers.

SC
Sounds good.

CAPCOM
The system really looks good to us.

SC
And here, Charlie.

This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 21 minutes. During the Change of Shift Press Conference we had about 3 minutes of conversation with the crew. During that conversation, Buzz Aldrin reported on - what appeared to be a weather disturbance off Cuba and the Caribbean and we also had some descriptions from Aldrin on the view of Earth from the spacecraft's present position. We'll played that back for you now and then stand by for any further live conversation with the crew.

SC
You sure do get a perspective in this thing in Zero G? Right now Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch and he can with his arms reach - oh - five windows. He can reach down into - oh, the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.

CAPCOM
Sounds like plastic man to me.

SC
I'm hiding under the left hand couch trying to stay out of his way.

CAPCOM
Be a good idea, Mike.

SC
All right Houston, Apollo 11. Do you have a cloud over the Houston area right now?

CAPCOM
Roger. We just had really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area right now.

SC
Yeah, I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you. It looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain too.

CAPCOM
Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east or nearly so as far as I could tell.

SC
Have news, this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM and I am running the cross hairs right now down the coast of California, west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America and I'm running into the South now.

CAPCOM
Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.

SC
The guys in the weather office out at Patrick wanted a report on the top but I guess all we can say is that we are above them.

CAPCOM
Rog. We'll pass it on OMEGO.

SC
Houston, do you see any predominant weather systems as far as funnel type? Any buildup of tropical storm type? Over.

Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances - there is one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba but it doesn't look like.

CAPCOM
Roger 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the check list. Over.

SC
Roger. We copy roll 21 - 261, pitch 090, yaw 000, high gain pitch plus 28 Yaw 271. (garble) Over.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

SC
Charlie, I have a couple of questions on the PTC. It seems to me that the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially on course at 0 degrees yaw and close to up a 90 degree pitch. It is just a question of stopping at 260 roll roughly and how about for a procedure going manual attitude three to REG command and then seeing how our deadband has already collasped, I will turn on our Panel 8 RCS thrusters at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it binds itself in and if I will do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll we should stop right there - in that position.

CAPCOM
Sounds pretty good. Stand by one

SC
In other words, it might save on gas

Hello Apollo 11, Houston, with a recommendation on the exiting PTCM, over.

SC
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to excell command on the manual attitude switches. Then to turn on the auto RCS select switches, and then go right to manned. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled, over.

SC
Okay, fine and I would guess go right command and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.

CAPCOM
Okay, that sounds good if, and when you get to the roll attitude desired just go right command at that time and that'll stop us right on.

SC
Yea I agree Charlie, that sounds right.

CAPCOM
Rog.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 39 minutes. This is a relative quiet period in the flight plan. The crew will be getting the spacecraft set up for the passive thermal control termination, and the Television transmission. Capcom Charlie Duke has just put in a call. We'll pick that up.

CAPCOM
Playing with the P37 while ago and we collapsed the dead-band back down. The dap assumed that the dead band was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at at that time. Since then we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude, such that if we did the proceedure as we call it up to you of going excell command, turning on all of the auto RCS select switches and the rate command it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the dead band collapsed. We can prevent that by just immediately priod to going to right command on the manual attitude switches, if you cycle the spacecraft control switch to SCS, then back CMC, over.

SC
Sounds like a winner.

This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 34 minutes. We've been advised that we are getting television transmission from Goldstone at the present time. This is an unscheduled TV transmission apparently of the crew checking out their onboard system.

PAO
We have lost lock on the high gain antenna at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 127,991 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4400 feet per second. The regularly scheduled time for the television transmission is 6:47 p.m. Central Daylight Time, and we are anticipating that that transmission will occur as scheduled.

And also, President Nixon has reported - declared a day of participation on Monday for all Federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for this EVA.

This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 41 minutes. We are going to be standing by here in Mission Control for the possibility that the crew would want to transmit that television pass early. The scheduled time for it was 6:47 Central Daylight time and about 15 minutes was scheduled. That would be at a ground elapsed time of 34 hours and we will have the system set up here in Mission Control to receive and release television should the crew decide to send us the transmission early.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 45 minutes and we do have a correction to the time given for the beginning of that TV nominally. The flight time is beginning at 34 hours to 34 hours, 15 minutes ground elapsed time. The previous conversion of that, that we gave you for Central Daylight Time was in error, it should be 6:32 P.M. Central Daylight Time beginning, assuming we start as the flight plan nominally has a transmission listed at 34 hours ground elapsed time. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 128,431 nautical miles from earth and the velocity continuing to drop off slowly, now reads 4386 feet per second.

You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the earth's ... a definite blue cast. See white bands of major cloud formations across the earth and can see coastlines, picked out the western US, San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja, California, and we see some cloud formations over southeastern US. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska. Looks like about 500 to 1,000 miles and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - Oh, a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees at a more south latitude.

One approximately along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Can you tell us exactly where those cross the land masses? Over.

SC
Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. Another band, which stands about 30 south correctly seems to appear to join equator

SC
It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloud band trending a gap in the cloud, trending northwest southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the Central United States. Is that about correct? Over.

Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast, although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer range.

Cue cards have a no. We have no intention of competing with the professionals. Believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all willing to find our favorite little corner to sit in. 0 g's very comfortable but after a while, you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up, or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that's seems more at home.

Okay, back to the high gain angles.

Roger.

SC
Now we have amputated those.

11, Houston. We have beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around .... That looks like the star chart coming into view now. Over.

SC
Yeah, those are Buzzs two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the right-hand window, window number 5.

CAPCOM
Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.

SC
You're right. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. There's just for show.

CAPCOM
We copy.

SC
While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out of our side windows, the sun going by and of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the earth. Now we find my window, course we have the sun, cause the sun is illuminating

in this direction, we see out our side windows, the sun going by and of course out of one of our windows right now we have the earth. Now right behind my window of course we have the sun and the sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these line vertical lines represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the moon, the moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will be in, it will be eclipsing the sun as we go behind it as we approach the lunar orbit insertion maneuver.

CAPCOM
Roger 11, we've, could you attempt a little bit better focus here, 11, over?

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston, that's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the sun and the mcon as they have gone at various placed throughout the ecliptic plane, over.

SC
Okay, Charlie. If we can get some of the wires untangled here we'll give you a demonstration of how easy push ups are up here. Come in, Roger.

CAPCOM
Just a view of Buzz there.

SC
When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.

CAPCOM
Rog, we copy, we couldn't figure out whether that was a chin up or a push up.

SC
Just take your choice I guess. Well it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there on earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Roger.

CAPCOM
Eleven Houston. We see a box full of goodies there, over.

SC
We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and the breakfast items and bacon in little small bits, beverages like fruit drink and over in the centerpart we have, oh all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.

CAPCOM
Rog.

SC
Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew here. All you have to do is 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot here with the filter on it that filters any gasses that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go. Beautiful chicken stew.

SC
Could I borrow that flashlight a second?

CAPCOM
The surgeons are saying thank you there for that.

SC
And it is sort of down in a dark corner so we have a flash light here to help us see things and if I can let go of it carefully it'll just hold itself right where it is.

CAPCOM
Ah roger (garbled)

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston, that's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there Mike.

SC
Well no matter how careful you let go you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.

CAPCOM
It looks fairly stable there with flow rotation.

SC
Well so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy.

SC
Charlie, we checked out the cable legnths, and we're thinking we might want to see if we can take the TV into the LM with us tomorrow for part of the time, over.

CAPCOM
Alright. Eleven, Houston. We have a patch. Could you cut the, put the focus slightly, over. Eleven, Houston. The scan on the camera makes the, that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker due to the scan on the TV. We can't see the eagle. Now it's a little bit better, over. Could you open the ESTOP a little bit more? Over.

Copy. Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on moniter which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console. We can see the DSKY up on the pannel, over.

SC
That'd be nice if you could take a look at all the circuit breakers. You could be sure the right ones are in and the right ones are out.

And we're glad of it. Boy you guys have sure been doing a good job of watching us. Charlie we appreciate it.

CAPCOM
The spacecraft's been beautiful eleven. There's really no complaints at all. Things are really great.

SC
Can you see this DSKY on the embasy.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. It appears that we can't quite tell what program when the cut went through. We see you punching in a verb 35 I think it is, over.

SC
Yea might as well tell the econs or tell the G&C's they better hold on to their hat and I'll push the inner button.

CAPCOM

This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 46 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4300 feet per second. During the TV transmission the crew advised that they may possibly be able to take the color television camera into the lunar module with them tomorrow at about 56 hours, 30 minutes, ground elapsed time. They reported that the cables had been checked and are perfectly long enough to take them into the lunar module. During the next hour or so the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving on, getting the crew set up for their rest period and eat period. This will be a very long rest period tonight, scheduled 10 hours. That will begin according to the flight plan, at about 37 hours, ground elapsed time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the flight plan, that perhaps again tonight we would be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early. At 34 hours, 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

At this time we are receiving the tape play-back which Goldstone, tracking site at Goldstone, California received from the spacecraft in that earlier unscheduled TV transmission. This was a test of the system using the spacecraft on the antennas, the small OMNI directional antennas. Normally transmissions from this distance in space would be - would require the high-gain antenna. This television transmission is being processed and converted to color and we anticipate that we'll have it available for playback at about 9:00 P.M.

Some of the time we will have a picture of the parts of it. We don't have good lock-on, and I will not have a good solid picture. We should also point out that this transmission was made with the OMNI directional antennas, which, of course, don't provide nearly the signal strength that we would get from the high gain antenna, which would be used.

This is Apollo Control. The view that we have at the present time appears to be out the window of the command module looking at the lunar module docking target.

PAO
And we seem to have a fairly good view here of the interior of the command module. This would look to be the panel, display panel with some of the fuel quantity dials on the right side of the cockpit.

PAO
At the time these television pictures were transmitted from the spacecraft, Apollo 11 was about 121 thousand nautical miles from earth. Where we do have signal lock on we got amazingly good quality on those little omni antennas. As we had mentioned before, normally the high gain antenna would be used for television transmission of this sort.

PAO
And we could almost make out a face in that one, and somebody's hand down at the instrument pannel.

PAO
That last view just before we lost picture lock up appeared to be the right center portion of the main display console, main display pannel in the command module.

That's me, how are you today?

SC
Just fine, how's the old white team today?

CAPCOM
The old white team's bright eyed and bushy tailed. We're ever alert down here.

SC
Ever alert, hey you got any medics down there watching high grade. I'm trying to do some running in place down here and I'm wondering just out of curosity whether it brings my heart rate up.

CAPCOM
Well they will spring into action here momentarily, stand by.

PAO
That was Mike Collins commenting that he was doing some running in place exercises, and we may get a brief view of that a little later on in this transmission if this picture stabilizes and holds still for us.

CAPCOM
Hello 11, we see your heart beat.

SC
(garbled) We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.

CAPCOM
I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.

SC
I think Buz is trying. He got it.

CAPCOM
Okay it's coming in at Goldstone Buz. We don't have it here in the center.

SC
I imagine that didn't help out the PTC very much.

SC
I don't know whether it's the vibration or what it is but it makes the, pitch and yaw rate needles on the FDAI jump up and down a little bit when we jump up and down.

We got a little distortion horizontal direction from our damping on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing.

Hello Apollo 11, Houston. The Goldstone TV guy said that they had some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just strayed, no waviness at all. Over.

they do distort vertical lines, though?

CAPCOM
Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.

SC
Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tends to put small waves in them.

CAPCOM
Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.

CAPCOM
Hello 11, Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you did a sharp vertical line on the picture, where the horizontal banding goes across it, does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.

SC
Okay. Understand it's not our monitor, must be the transmitter or something.

Apollo 11, Houston. We're just about at the limit where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI on the TV. It - The picture is, I guess, it'd be just almost zero at this point.

SC
Okay, well for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC. If you do, for the best high gain angle, and also it'd be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the earth out of one of our windows.

Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.

This is Apollo Control. That concludes the replay of the test transmission from Apollo 11. That transmission occurred about 2 hours prior to the regularly scheduled TV transmission this evening. The crew, apparently, testing out the onboard system, and we received about 52 minutes of intermittant television using the spacecraft OMNI directional antennas.

At the time of the transmission, Apollo 11 was about 121,000 nautical miles from earth.

Hello Apollo 11, Houston. One request the optics switched to 0 and we have a lot of theories of why it maneuvered at 7/10ths a moment ago Mike, but no real definite answer. We'll be back with you later, over.

SC
Okay, no rush, Charlie.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
Roger, Mike I think we can explain that 7/10ths rate. When we - the first half through to show through the VERB 49 so we had a large error between our actual PU and desired PU in roll and with that situation the DAP or the vehicle will roll or maneuver rather at a rate - that is loaded in which was 3/10ths plus 4/10ths rate and it will limit it 4/10ths above the desired rate. So, that is, if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual which we did, so therefore the rate was 4/10ths plus 3/10ths which would give you the 7/10ths, over.

SC
Okay, thank you.

At this time Apollo 11 is 137,219 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4132 feet per second.

The end of the cloud near the tropical conversions clouds all along the equator clearly separates the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formation for us.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that - I understand you can see that shadow being cast by that cloud between Afganistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.

SC
It looks like it's a shadow. (garble) coming around to back that way - -

CAPCOM
We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. Will you stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC. I think things will get better.

SC
Okay, coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you now.

CAPCOM
Roger, we're hearing you.

PAO
That's Buzz Aldrin with the description.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. The noise on the com seems to have quited down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the earth out of view in your window. Over.

SC
Okay, it looks as though the lines of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.

CAPCOM
Okay, we copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and yes that - all I can give you first hand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now on about 6 degrees in yaw which is significantly greater- about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We're watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.

SC
Okay may be ought to next time

Yes, we could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effects on PTC would be in a waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11, I am looking at the clouds now on Pakistan through the sextant and it appear to be one single cell in the later stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one -

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single-cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.

SC
Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular and you could definitely tell it was a one-single cell in the later stages of development. It must have been up to over 50,000 feet though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenominally clear. You can see all the lakes, the Dead Sea, stood out quite well. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.

SC
Well, I can't see it now. It's out from the field of view.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
And I don't know how you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.

CAPCOM
I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good idea.

SC
Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can tract it all the way up.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
I guess that is down though, isn't it?

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston.

SC
Go ahead, Houston.

CAPCOM
Roger. We have been working under the assumption that we would take about an hour for the interference from a waste water dump to dissipate to the point where you can reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation conditions now. Over?

SC
Yes. Stand by a minute, Bruce.

CAPCOM
Okay.

SC
My guess would be that a telescope is rather useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motion.

CAPCOM
Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant then.

SC
Right. I think so, but Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few verticals that need to be aligned.

CAPCOM
Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?

SC
Well, it's not quite as useful. It doesn't seem to be. Depending on the position of the sun it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack it's effectiveness. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. What - is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.

SC
Now, it's a reflection from the sun.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
The sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached the telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that Ed has provided, I think would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to burn through the telescope we could those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in, but so far we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.

Roger.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low bit rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter.

In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the Western Gulf of Mexico. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from a Norwegian Explorer, Thor Heyerdahl which said that the crew of his papyrus boat RA will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the RA today repairing damage from storms this past week which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard. The vessel was 725 miles east of Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the RA," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the RA on Tuesday. In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early preseason workouts at Kerrville and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball - was it yesterday - Thursday - St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburgh 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Franscisco 14, and Los Angeles 13.

with gas in the food bags like the janitor reported?

SC
Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these 2 hydrogen filters which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the filters to start loosing their efficiency. A couple of times I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy.

SC
Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through it. Some of the food bags are so crumpled near the entry way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.

CAPCOM
Mike that's good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-18-69     CDT 15:3  -  GET 55:00  -  TAPE 173/1

SC
Houston, Apollo 11, we've terminated direc to O2, our cabin pressure is 57 and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the off we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.

CAPCOM
Roger. Eleven, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the command module the following items, over.

SC
Ready to copy.

CAPCOM
Roger, we'd like you to pick up the, out of the flight data file, the surface check list, the mission rules no go card, the DIP, APS, RCS limit cutrons, over.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston, the reason we want you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those 3 over.

SC
Roger, we figured you would.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 55 hours 10 minutes. Our network controllers just advised that we are receiving live television at Goldstone. We would presume this is a test of the system, similar to what we received from the crew yesterday. The crew is planning to send television from the lunar module when they ingress. Stand by - here's a call from the crew.

CAPCOM
Flight configure here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes, over.

SC
Rog, this is just for free. This isn't what we had in mind.

CAPCOM
Roger.

PAO
That was Capcom, Charlie Duke, advising the crew that we are not quite prepared for television reception at this time. You heard Mike Collins respond that this one is for free. We still intend to get the television transmission during the time the crew is in the lunar module, beginning about 56 hours 20 minutes ground elapsed time, which would be about 4:52 PM central daylight time. We are getting a black and white television picture in the control center at this time and we should have that in color by now. An anterior view of the command module looking up into the LM hatch, CSM land hatch area. We can't quite make out which crewman we're seeing up in the tunnel working with the probe and drogue assembly.

PAO
Getting a very good view of the work going on in the command and service module tunnel. It appears to be Neil Armstrong working in the tunnel. Working on the drogue and probe assembly. This extremely sharp clear picture is coming to us from about a 175 thousand miles distance from earth.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-18-69     CDT 15:47  -  GET 55:15  -  TAPE 174/1

PAO
extremely sharp picture is coming to us from about 175,000 miles distance from earth. Presently about 48,000 miles from the moon.

PAO
That appears as if it might be all the free TV, as Mike Collins put it. After we got in we expect to get the television transmission from the time the crew is in the lunar module and that period of activity is scheduled to begin in about 56 hours 20 minutes with the ingress to the lunar module. And we understand it's starting to get a picture back again. It was in lock momentarily and now we had it back again. Neil Armstrong up in the tunnel at this point, removing the probe and drogue assembly in preparation for the ingress to the lunar module. A network controller just reported that this television is coming to us on the 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California.

PAO
We just saw the probe assembly start to come loose now as Neil Armstrong is -

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.

SC
Yeah, it's loose now. Can you see that?

CAPCOM
Rog, Neil. It's real good.

SC
There's not much light up in that area but certainly this TV set should pick it up.

CAPCOM
There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently sun shafting on it. Gets just about enough - part to make it out. Over.

SC
Hey, how good does it look on the lights?

CAPCOM
Oh, okay. You're right.

SC
Okay, it's loose now. Coming down.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber. Over.

SC
You bet. It's the only way it's pretty massive but it goes where you direct it.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. That's beautiful picture now, we've got. We're going to have 12 seconds delaying. Adjust and just bringing it down by the optics now.

SC
Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.

CAPCOM
Rog. We're really getting a great picture, here. Over.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-18-69     CDT 15:47  -  GET 55:15  -  TAPE 174/2

CAPCOM
11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.

SC
Roger.

CAPCOM
We can see the probe now. A correction, the drogue.

SC
Roger.

SC
Okay, drogue removal is coming next.

CAPCOM
Roger. As we suspected.

PAO
Once removal of the drogue is completed, they will have access to the LM hatch and be able to go into the tunnel.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Now it's a good view of storage area under the couch.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Looks like it's pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.

SC
Oh, it's not really bad. This TV cable is getting in the way.

CAPCOM
We see lots of arms.


END OF TAPE


APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY     7-18-69     CDT 15:57  -  GET 55:25  -  TAPE 175/1

CAPCOM
We see lots of arms.

SC
The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stage hands don't know where they stand.

CAPCOM
Well, you got to really have a union card there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.

PAO
This unscheduled televison transmission has now run about 18 minutes, and we have no estimate at this point as to how long it will continue. Mike Collins reported that it would - we would go ahead with the regularly scheduled one when they are in the LM.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.

SC
Roger. We do.

CAPCOM
Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures here, Buzz. Real clear.

SC
Okay. We might have got just a little bit of nothing there. Is it just a one small white dot?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

PAO
Have a good view here of the computer display and keyboard assembly with the green lights flashing.

SC
We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.

CAPCOM
Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll cal.

SC
And that's a plus.

CAPCOM
Roger. Plus.

PAO
The reference to the roll cal, or roll calibration index marker in the tunnel, which shows how far off exact 0 the 2 vehicles were when the docking occurred.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.

SC
It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.

SC
I think that's mostly the camera. It's subdued to say the least.

CAPCOM
Roger. It's funny. It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.

SC
Anyhow, the dock latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.

CAPCOM
That sounds fine to us. Over.

PAO
Mike Collins reporting there on the appearance of the latches.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-18-69     CDT 15:57  -  GET 55:25  -  TAPE 175/2

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We can read the decals up there on the LM hatch.

SC
Well, let me move it up and see how much you can read.

CAPCOM
Okay.

CAPCOM
We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. It's - to reset, unlatch handle, latch behind grip and pull back 2 full strokes. That's about all we can make out.

SC
You got an A plus.

CAPCOM
Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.

SC
I'm standing six feet from it, Charlie. You can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with your system.

CAPCOM
Roger.

PAO
An interested observer of these amazingly clear pictures coming to us from more than 175,000 miles out in space is Astronaut Gene Cernan, who got a first hand view of some of this same area of the spacecraft during his Apollo 10 flight.

CAPCOM
That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. Over.

SC
Roger.

SC
Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there,

CAPCOM
Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor - our TV people say it is a burn spot, but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.

SC
Roger. Thank you.

SC
Okay, the dump valve is actuated.

CAPCOM
Roger, copy, then we see it very clarly. Is that you Buzz with your hand on it?

SC
Yeah.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb, over.

SC
It is considering the amount of light up in there. Hey, we are about to open our hatch now.

CAPCOM
Rog. There is that same guy when you opened up the door, why, he is waiting there for you and he turns the lights on.

SC
How about that. It's like the refrigerator.

PAO
That conversation between Charlie Duke and Mike Collins referring to the automatic light that comes on in the LM when the hatch is opened.

CAPCOM
Buzz, the view by your left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the velcro on it, and that's' about all we can make out right now. Now we see the helmets, do we?

SC
We don't see anything loose up there.

CAPCOM
Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage space.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Buzzy already in? Over.

SC
Roger. I'm halfway in, hanging out, or turning around, I guess.

CAPCOM
Roger.

PAO
Buzz Aldrin, reporting that he's halfway into the LM. His view is inside the LM cabin.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.

SC
Okay. Stand by.

CAPCOM
11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the sun is finally coming through the shade.

SC
Yes, I'm afraid it's - we're just about plus z toward the sun.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the sun - the LM. Over.

SC
Well, that may be good in some ways, but -

CAPCOM
We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. Utility's on.

SC
Yes, let me show you a view looking the other way.

CAPCOM
Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the flood light up there.

CAPCOM
I think now I see the utility light is still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-18-69     CDT 16:07  -  GET 55:35  -  TAPE 176/2

CAPCOM
We see you waving.

PAO
Buzz Aldrin has apparently carried the camera into the LM with him, showing us Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins back in the CSM.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.

SC
Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - it looks like - the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you like to see? Over.

CAPCOM
Stand by. Right, Buzz; that looks good to us. Thank you much.

SC
It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?

CAPCOM
Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
We had a shot momentarily - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.

SC
I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back there, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.

CAPCOM
The light is superb.

SC
How's the sun coming in? How's the sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?

CAPCOM
It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window- there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.

SC
Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.

SC
The lighting in the LM is very nice, just like completely daylight, and everything is just beautiful. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.

CAPCOM
Roger. We got a good view now of the DEDA and also, Buzz's ATA.

PAO
This ingress to the lunar module came about -

CAPCOM
ACA

PAO
This ingress to the lunar module came about 40 minutes ahead of the flight plan, and we would presume that the unscheduled TV is perhaps merging with the schedule a little bit early.

SC
Every thing seems to be in place down there.

CAPCOM
Roger, we got the dump valves in view, over.

SC
Roger.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. We see you're removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up by the AOT. The instrument pannels are coming into view behind.

SC
Yea, I think probably it'd be best since we've done an SPS burn to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the rechart station. Would you care to comment on that one. We can do either, just as easily.

CAPCOM
Stand by we'll have an answer for you momentarily.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. It's really a super shot of the thing displaying.

SC
The vehicle is suprisingly free of any debris floating around, it's very clean.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really great.

SC
Now you know how we feel.

SC
Okay Neils OCS is about 57, 58 hundred.

CAPCOM
Copy.

SC
And mine is about 58 hundred also.

CAPCOM
Copy.

PAO
Aldrins hand resting on one of the portable life support systems which will be used on the moons surface.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. That's a good shot of Neils PLSS there, over.

SC
Yea that's fine.

CAPCOM
Eleven Houston just a moment ago we had a good shot of your PLSS Buz, and the two helmet stowage bags, and now behind your left shoulder Buz, we have your DSKY and the ACA.

PAO
We're not quite sure who's holding the camera at this point. Apparently it's drifting freely inside the cabin. Or more likely attached to some convenient point within the LM cabin.

SC
We're going to go ahead and take all the loose data on back into the command module, Charlie.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11 Houston. Buz it appears that you didn't put on the sun filter and viewing the sun through the AOT, over.

SC
Yea, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards (garbled) than I can be able to see in the MT.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
We've got a beautiful view of the side of the command module out of the AOT looking in the left rear deton.

CAPCOM
Rog.

SC
I can see the hatch and all the EVA hand rails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module. I can read the letters on the hatch cover, it's a boost cover release, and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening place where the 20B goes.

CAPCOM
Rog. Great shot now back down into the -

SC
And left on the - -

CAPCOM
Go ahead Buz, over.

SC
Say again.

CAPCOM
I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the command module.

SC
Okay. And the left decent I can see the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.

CAPCOM
Rog.

PAO
Neil Armstrong has apparently been holding the camera, looking back down through the tunnel it appears now that he's handed the camera to Buz Aldrin. As he is still looking back through the tunnel we see Mike Collins in the background there.

SC
Charlie is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?

CAPCOM
Stand by.

SC
We don't have any circulation in here and it might get a little on the warm side.

CAPCOM
Rog.

SC
We'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.

CAPCOM
It sounds like a good idea, over.

Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shapes go in this LM is nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.

SC
That we will do.

SC
Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the Command Module, right hand rendezvous window.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
Well we see it now. Thanks a lot Buzz. It's a good view through the over head.

SC
One (garble) is on by the overhead.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
There we go. We've got it now.

SC
There wasn't very much debris in the Command Module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts and screws and lint Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.

CAPCOM
Roger. Sounds good.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody standing back at it though. Over.

SC
Charlie can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the nautical window?

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.

SC
They're looking through a lot of layers of glass.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking in there though.

SC
Okay. Here he is. I've got him. I've got him on the monitor now.

CAPCOM
Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello in there.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation to the ISA is to store it back over the instrument panel. Over.

SC
Roger. Will do.

PAO
This transmission has been running about 54 minutes at this point.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read system a assent fuel, S in oxidizer. QUADS 1, QUAD 4. It's really unbelievable the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.

CAPCOM
We can even see the barber pole on

We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure quantity, quantity, TC O2. You can read the scale on the eight ball. Over.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We seen across these barber pole and we had the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits. We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.

SC
Yes. We're going to tape that one over.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Going to tape that one over.

CAPCOM
We concur.

SC
The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.

At this point, we've had to take the color down momentarily. We've run out of tape in the color conversion recorder. We estimate we'll have the black and white for about 5 minutes while the tape changes in process and then continue to convert in color after that point.

CAPCOM
Roger, stand by. We'll have an answer.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was praising, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcasted. 11, Houston.

SC
We understood that, Charlie.

CAPCOM
Okay, on the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.

SC
Okay, that's what we'll do.

PAO
The black and white view that you're seeing now is the unconverted color pictures that comes down from the spacecraft. The flicker, of course, is taken out in the conversion process. We've now been receiving television pictures from the spacecraft for about 1 hour.

SC
Checklist stowage packet, it's, got a 16-millimeter camera in it and it's got this little cylinder and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.

CAPCOM
Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.

SC
It's got an arrow on the back and it says "turn", but I'm afraid to turn it.

SC
Well, it's picking up a little bit of circulation in here.

CAPCOM
What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.

SC
I'd say maybe 73, 75.

CAPCOM
Rog.

SC
It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the same as the command module. It was warmer, or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.

CAPCOM
Houston copies that.

CAPCOM
11, Houston.

SC
You may be able to see some -

CAPCOM
Go ahead.

SC
Some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being eliminated by sun shafting in the window.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. Our view of the panel eleven is, gets brighter then darker. Are you changing the F-stop at all, over.

SC
Now what's happening is we get pretty close to the window now and then drives the automatic light control into the stop I think.

CAPCOM
I think that's right.

SC
Yea I had the switch on outside while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.

CAPCOM
Roger. Eleven, Houston, we seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly on the screen now, over.

SC
Yea I'm choking on one ever so often.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. Your show is going out to the US now. We're about to get this satelite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that, over.

SC
Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket. Where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Apollo 11, Houston. We keep mrveling about the color and the clear of your picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's just perfect, over.

CAPCOM
And Eleven, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.

SC
Roger, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.

CAPCOM
Rog.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look?

SC
It looks pretty good as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without holding it for the whole time.

CAPCOM
Roger looks like to us it's going to work real well.

SC
Give me enough room to - Yea I think so.

CAPCOM
Buzz we see you putting your window guard in place there and back up to the ISA now.

SC
Houston ask if they know if the 90 degree bracket can be stowed in the commanders stowage assembly.

Our monitor is a little bit wavey, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.

CAPCOM
11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.

SC
Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

SC
Okay, they don't in our monitor and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometime.

CAPCOM
Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.

PAO
We've been receiving television now from the spacecraft for about an hour and 20 minutes. Apollo 11 presently 177,000 miles from earth.

CAPCOM
What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?

SC
That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of our camera, there.

CAPCOM
Rog. Now we got it. It appears to us that Neil's to check the velcro map there.

CAPCOM
Okay Buzz, we see the card up now.

SC
Okay, for those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers and we have another card like this but the timeline broke that we had layed down on the table in front of the - down there at this play keyboard, and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. And we obviously have to hold these in place in zero "G" so we make use of the velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here and then we just turn the pages over when we go to a new sequences in our timeline of procedures.

CAPCOM
Roger.

11, that's real good camera work.

SC
That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside down.

CAPCOM
Roger. You're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. We had a good view of the tapemeter.

SC
We're giving you a picture now, of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support systems backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Inside the helmet visors, are the EVA gloves, with the blue tips. I'm about to take those out now.

CAPCOM

SC
Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGCS. The problem is, we don't know whether to line AGS to PNGCS or PNGCS to AGS.

It's like old home week Charlie to get back into the LM again.

CAPCOM
Roger. I can imagine.

SC
It's a ... from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the Command Module. Must be about - or 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.

CAPCOM
Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?

SC
We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.

CAPCOM
Roger. I'd advised him to keep his hands off the switches.

SC
If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do today. He won't let me touch it any more.

That's the earth and we have a very good view of it. Today they're a few more cloudbands on than yesterday when we came down to you but it's a beautiful sight.

PAO
That description from Neil Armstrong?

SC
We had some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you or do you have a clear picture?

CAPCOM
Neil we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen which our TV guy says is an apparently burned out spot in the camera but it should come back. Over.

SC
Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day is all we ask.

Thank you Apollo 11. I'm sure that if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, so they'll appreciate that.

Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.

SC
We got a little more work to do up here - Charlie, we are going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it. Try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.

CAPCOM
Roger, Neil. We are not trying to push you. We are just trying to get an idea of about water dumps and about starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time over.

Roger, standby, we'll have that to you in a moment.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 56 hours 51 minutes. Buzz Aldrin has now been in the lunar module for a little over an hour and 13 minutes. We estimate that Neil Armstrong has perhaps been in the LM about 15 or 20 minutes less than that. Due to the length of that television transmission, the change of shift press conference has been cancelled. The particpants were unable to wait for the duration of the press conference and with other duties and the press conference has been cancelled. At 56 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 3 minutes. The decision as you heard relayed up to the crew there, that we would go into the passive thermal control mode with the spacecraft in a slow roll at 58 hours in the flight plan. I would rule out further television for today. I would also like to repeat that the change of shift press conference for the previous shift was cancelled due to the length of that television transmission, and we do expect to have a change of shift briefing following this shift probably between 11:30 and 12:pm CDT. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 178,236 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity has dropped down now to 3146 feet per second. At 57 hours, 4 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 44 minutes. We've had no further reports from the crew to indicate whether or not Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have returned to the command module. And I guess that would answer our question. Neil Armstrong reporting that they are finished with their work in the LM, will be coming out shortly. Apollo 11 is now 179,490 nautical miles from earth. Traveling at a speed of 3,121 feet per second. In a little less than 3 hours, we'll pass a milestone of sorts, as the spacecraft passes into the lunar sphere of influence. And what we mean by that, is that at that point, the spacecraft will be under the dominant influence of the moon's gravity. The moon's gravitational force will have the predominant effect on the trajectory of the spacecraft. And at that point, our displays in Mission Control monitoring velocity and altitude will switch from earth reference to moon reference. We'll then begin monitoring the progress of the spacecraft as it continues to accelerate toward the moon. At 57 hours 46 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

CAPCOM
Hello Apollo 11, Houston. We're standing by to watch your startup on the PTC at any time. You can start off at the verb 49. Over.

This is Apollo Control. That was Neil Armstrong reporting that they are now reinstalling the probe and drogue, which is just about on the flight plan schedule, and they reported that they would be putting the spacecraft in a slow roll shortly to maintain passive thermal control. In that mode the spacecraft rotates at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain even heating. We have a precise time on that sphere of influence change, the point of which the moon - for calculation purposes here. Mission Control, comes under the predominate influence - the spacecraft comes under the predominate influence of the moon's gravitational field, and we now calculate that that will occur at 61 hours, 39 minutes, 55 seconds, ground elapsed time.

One slight change on the APS DPS fuel and temp pressure cards, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.

Okay, if any of those in the flight plan. The secondary radiator, for example.

This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. Apollo 11 now 182,000 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity down to 3072 feet per second. We've had very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the flight plan calls for the crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the flight plan to pass along. The television transmission which had been scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to 100 hours, 50 minutes in the flight plan has been deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission from the flight plan was made due to a lack of available satelite channels to relay the signal from the tracking site of Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape, the music of course is erased, and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft.

Houston, Apollo 11, ready to copy your update.

Roger, stand by.

CAPCOM
Okay Buzz, the first item, is that we have indications that your landing sight obliques are not in the proper position. If you will check we think that the intermediate scale landing sight oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar land mark book. We think that the large scale, landing sight oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book, over.

SC
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.

CAPCOM
Roger, according to our storage list the landing sight oblique should be in the transfer bag. In the back up set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book, and that's the reason we think that they might be, not where you think they are, over.

SC
Okay, we've got three obieques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating hidden view and 50 degree LPD, and all three of those are in the transfer book, over.

CAPCOM
Roger, fine. We were wrong in our back up set. We had those out of place. Looks like the on board data is good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS DIPS fuel cord, that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got to correct that typo error, over.

That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at - the line in front of the column 5 minutes to low gate. Now the next line is under the G&C exchange, pitch and roll GDA. You can scratch that line completely, over.

SC
Roger, got it.

CAPCOM
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS and it is a typo error under the three - in the line three axis attitude control. We proceed to the right at PDI plus 05 you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under 5 minutes to low gate, over.

SC
Okay, we are stopping at it 5 minutes to low gate.

CAPCOM
That's affirm. That completes that card. The rest of the update are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really in good shape. Your gyros have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 MERU, Y of . plus .87 Z of minus .11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe. We gave you a X drift of plus .79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus .02 MERU. I see between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments work did not really give us enough time to get a real good, completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the gyros are looking. The PIPA'S are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those also, over.

SC
This is Apollo 11, radio check.

CAPCOM
Roger, reading you fly by OMNI, over.

SC
Okay, that clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform something about 52 hours after that, we never heard you again.

CAPCOM
Roger, guess we were changing antennas standby. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word here is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the gyros and very small drift in our PIPA'S, over.

SC
Roger, thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS reel, what that change of pitch may mean.

CAPCOM
Copy, a few words of clarification on the RCS, oh roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate.

SC
Yeah, that's right. I'm not quite sure what that really means (garble).

are saying is - if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a lost of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would - continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing, over.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 59 hours 57 minutes. A few moments ago you heard Capcom Charlie Duke advise the crew to terminate the passive thermal control mode that they are presently in and reestablish the three revolution per hour roll rate about the spacecraft longitudal axis that is used for thermal control. We had noticed a unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode ideally it would roll about the longitudal axis with very little wobble and if wobble is introduced for one reason or another, the reaction control system jets would come on as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had ocurred and gone beyond prescribed limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct. The jet firings on past missions do tend to disturb the crews sleep. Rather than have the reaction control system jets come on during the night and perhaps have to awaken the crew to reestablish the passive thermal control at that time we elected to correct it now.

This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 37 minutes. We said good bye - goodnight to the crew about 10 minutes ago. We expect that they will be settling down their rest period shortly. And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600 nautical miles from earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest in a comment made by Neil Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a contingency EVA. It would have no function in a normal mission such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the command service module, the light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would - repeat, that it'd have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that we get and play those back. The passive thermal control mode, which was reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally. At 100 - rather 60 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Negative, if you look at the plot which we'll save for you and let you see it post flight. It started off immediately on the first rev and just spiraled out to about oh, 20 to 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an off set pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees, but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge so we told you and started over again, over.

Flight Surgeon says there is no indication at this time that they have begun to sleep, but we expect they'll be getting to sleep here shortly. Coming up in less than 10 seconds now, we'll be crossing into the sphere of influence of the moon. A computational changeover will be made here in Mission Control. At this point as the moon's gravitational force becomes the dominant effect on the spacecraft trajectory, and our displays will shift from Earth reference to moon reference. At that point, which occurred a few seconds ago, the spacecraft was at a distance of 186,437 nautical miles from Earth, and 33,822 nautical miles from the moon. The velocity with respect to the Earth was 2990 feet per second, and with respect to the moon, about 3272 feet per second.

CAPCOM
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you actually got in the chamber and what you' re reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage onboard correlates to 83 psi actual, and we recommend that you stick to LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage - that is no change to the mission rules. Over.

SC
Apollo I1, roger. We got all that.

CAPCOM
Houston, out.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 71 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the moon now 11,232 nautical miles approaching at a velocity of 4,141 feet per second.

Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas an hour or so ago. Over.

SC
Roger. What sort of (garbled) could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the sun right behind the edge of the moon now.

SC
Roger. What sort of (garbled) could you recommend for that solar corona. We've got the sun right behind the edge of the moon now.

SC
Roger. It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three-dimensional aspect of (garbled) corona coming from behind the moon glares.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
And it looks as though - I guess what gives it that three-dimensional effect is the earth shine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I right that up, I believe it's Tycho in moonshine, I mean in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the moon. Even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

SC
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend you using magazine uniform which is loaded with high speed black-and-white film. Interior lights off. Electric hasselblads' with the 80 millimeter lens, and you're going to have to hand hold this, I guess. We're recommending an F stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.

SC
Okay. You want the magazine uniform instead of magazine tangle. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not-to-interfere basis, of course. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
And on the exposures, we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second, and if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.

SC
Roger. Copy.

CAPCOM
Roger. Out.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.

SC
Go ahead, Houston.

CAPCOM
Roger. We'd like to do a little cryo tank balancing, so if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the cyro switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.

SC
Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get it in a minute.

CAPCOM
Roger. How far out can you see the corona extending? Over.

SC
How much - a little bit like the (garbled) light? It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.

Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters off for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?

CAPCOM
That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters off and oxygen tank number 1 heaters off.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
Roger, out.

SC
We have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters off. I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters off.

CAPCOM

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.

CAPCOM
Oh, very good.

PAO
That was Mike Collins reporting.

SC
And Houston. I suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see - throwing the light out to 2 lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about - about an eight to a quarter of the lunar radius.

CAPCOM
Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately 1/8 to I quarter lunar radius. Over.

SC
That's 2 lunar- 2 lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right, a quarter to an eights of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the south pole.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. The sky is full of stars, just like the nights out on earth. But all the way here, we have just been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps trough the monoculars, but not recognize any star pattern.

CAPCOM
I guess it has turned into night up there early, hasn't it?

SC
Really has.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 72 hours, 7 minutes. Apollo 11 is 9761 nautical miles from the moon, velocity 4217 feet per second. Weight 9612 pounds.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.

SC
Okay. We went to high gain. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.

CAPCOM
Roger. We missed the OMNI switch there. Over.

SC
All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to flow on secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is the normal system of operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease is always due to contraction in the fluid. Over.

SC
Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as though there were no decrease in accumulated quantity. Right?

CAPCOM
Roger. Press on.

SC
Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.

CAPCOM
Houston. Roger. Out.

SC
And that is a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we are going to do it or don't do it anymore.

CAPCOM
That's for sure.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, we can read you up the morning news here.

SC
Go right, ahead, let's hear it.

CAPCOM
Roger, hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
First off, it looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil, "The Czar of the Ship." I think maybe they got the wrong mission. West Germany has declared Monday to be "Apollo Day." school children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places. BBC in London is considering a special radio alarm system to call people to their TV sets in case there is a change in the EVA time on the moon. And in Italy, Pope Paul VI has arranged for a special color TV circuit at his summer residence in order to watch you, even though Italian television is still black and white. Back here in Houston, your three wives and children got together for lunch yesterday at Buzz's house. And according to Pat it turned out to be a gabfest. The children swam and did some high jumping over at Buzz's bamboo pole. In Moscow, space engineer Anatoly Koritsky, was quoted by Tass as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by he press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the moon and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis. Even the kids at camp got into the news when Mike, Jr. was quoted as replying "yeah" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history - then after a short pause he asked, "What is history?" In Washington, President Nixon is planning to use his executive power to streamline the Interstate Commerce Commission. According to industry sources, it was reported Nixon would trim the commission from 11 to 7 members by not making new appointments. And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the Sports World the Houston Astros rallied in the 9th inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the 9th however, things looked pretty bleak. The Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out Jesus Aiou stroked a single to the right field. John Edwards hit another single to the right, Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score. Then a sacrifice fly by Denis Menke Brought in the final run. They really came through in the 9th. And other games in the National League.

SC
Yeah, those Astros have really been catching those flys since they put a roof on the stadium.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 9:01  -  GET 72:29  -  TAPE 217/2

CAPCOM
Good work. In other games in the National League, New York beat Montreal 5 to 2; Pittsburgh beat St. Louis 4 to 1; and Atlanta over San Diego in the first game of a double header 6 to 2. Im the American League, Detroit beat Cleveland 4 to nothing; New York trounced Washington 5 to nothing; Baltimore out hit - Boston out hit Baltimore to score 6 runs to the Orioles' 2; and Chicago beat Kansas City 6 to 1. Okay, in golf world, Tommy Jacobs, infrequent competitor in recent years took the lead in the Philadelphia Golf Classic yesterday. His second round score was 139. You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham says that all the signs are right for your trip to the moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgement, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have quote, "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling," unquote. Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative. And last but not -

SC
Who said all that? (laughter)

CAPCOM
Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now that we've got a check with Flight Operations for all the signs of the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.

Okay, following Tommy Jacobs, we have a hot smoking word from a Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She say that all the signs are right for your trip to the moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgement, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted and distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have quote, "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling," unquote.

The orbital period for Apollo 11's present orbit 2 hours 8 minutes 37 seconds, and as you heard we passed up to the crew information that we would perform the LOI 2 burn using only bank A. The banks are the drive mechanisms for the ball values in the service propulsion system. They open and close these ball valves. The valves allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the engine. There are redundant valves and redundant banks, banks A and B. There was apparently - they are driven by nitrogen and that was the reference to the pressure drop there. It was apparently a leak in nitrogen tank B during the LOI 1 burn. This burn was performed with both banks open. The engine can be operated with only bank. It's apparent that the tank leaked only during the burn while the bank was actuated. Pressure has held steady since the end of the burn and the experts are reducing the data and looking at the leak rate, determining whether it was constant throughout the burn, precisely what the situation is. We're showing pressure in tank B of 1960 psi. In tank A 2250 psi. Both of these are well above the red lines of 400 pounds psi.

CAPCOM

SC
No, not of (garble). I've got several pictures of it though.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy.

PAO
That was Buzz Aldrin making a report, a geological report on that site pass.

CAPCOM
We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor a sort of a brownish gray.

SC
(Garble) the way they're describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows, it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera right now is looking out the number 5 window and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, and for your information we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now .

SC
Okay.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the (garbled) B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.

SC
I'm flying in an SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to mascons or what, but I can get it completely stabiized in data and let it alone and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.

CAPCOM
This is Houston, Roger.

PAO
That was Mike Collins making that report.

SC
Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at we approach the powered descent. Over.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. Roger, and we're through with the uplinks. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.

SC
Roger, copy.

SC
Okay, Houston, several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data and since then I have been moving forward, the LM pointed straight down toward the radius vector and that's been dispite a number of down minimum pitch impulses.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
We're over Smyth's Sea right now.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
We're about 88 degrees east of it I would estimate.

CAPCOM
We show you about south of the - southwest of the crater Jansky right now.

SC
The Smyth's Sea doesn't look much like a Sea. It's - the area which is devoid of craters of which is not very much is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the Mare at all.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a zero of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?

SC
Roger. We're approaching the approach pass through ignition. This is equivalent to 12 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 83 degrees, I guess. 83 degrees east, Does that correspond to locations you're holding there presently?

CAPCOM
Roger. We're showing your present position as about 77 - 76 degrees east looking back towards the east.

We've now heard from all three Apollo 11 crewmembers during this television pass. The individual talking earlier was Neil Armstrong.

SC
Crater Schubert and Gilbert in the center right now, and that sums it up at about a little over 12 minutes before powered descent. Instead of me looking - as they're looking back at it, we're looking straight down at it.

CAPCOM
Roger. We show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles, and of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.

SC
Say, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. Update is increasing toward my desired 315 and I'll let the hand controller alone here and I'll bet you it reverses itself.

SC
Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.

SC
Okay, there's - on the right side of the screen at the present time there's a triple crater with a small crater between the first and second, and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. (Garble) it does have a central peak at Schubert Y. There's actually several of them. You can observe those, plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.

CAPCOM
Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.

SC
Okay, we're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside wall and the bottom of it here looks flat. Look at data on the DSKY it's stabilized and is holding steady now.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Looking out the window I can see a number of tall craters on the bottom of Shubardt N. We're coming up on the Bombing Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on crater of my choice - name of crater Camp.

Okay, we observed the behavior of your DSKY and we got the day ahead to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it and we will report back to you probably in a rev or two.

Okay, well in the meantime I am going to pitch down toward 315.

Three craters, three horizontal craters, that we now have in the field of view, are immediately underneath the ground track. The right-hand, the largest crater that you see, is through' the (garble).

CAPCOM
Roger, we concur on the identification of this crater.

CAPCOM
- and we show you coming up on landmark ALPHA 1 shortly.

SC
Roger, Mike is having his first look at ALPHA 1 at the present time.

SC
Yeah, it _ is a great bright crater. It is not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and I would guess impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make ... correction the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater ... is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.

PAO
We have been some 17 minutes now into this television pass and standing by continuing to monitor.

CAPCOM
Here we can show you over the Sea of Fertility now and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.

SC
Now the crater that is in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'll be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater and you can see maybe two or three craters in the bottom of it on the west end wall, the wall that is now nearest the - the camera, near the bottom of the screen we should see a dimple crater there, within the outside and then coming back toward the bottom of the screen into the left, you can see a series of depressions. It is this type of connective craters that give us most interest to discover why they are in the particular pattern that they are in. I'll zoom the camera in and try and give you a closer look at it.

CAPCOM
Roger, we are observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the other photos

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 15:10  -  GET 78:38  -  TAPE 241/2

CAPCOM
doesn't seem to stand out very well here.

SC
Well, they are not central peaks, they are depressions in the center.

CAPCOM Roger.

SC
And you will notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've put in oh a dozen interim impulses and pitch down and I am still far from corrective back 315. We are moving the camera over to the right window now to give you well Langrenus. It - its several central peaks and -

CAPCOM
Roger, we got Langrenus in our screen now.

CAPCOM
Okay, 11, this is Houston. We are getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its really conspicious central peak.

SC
The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.

SC
Well, it may of been named by - a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.

CAPCOM
Roger, that is very interesting -

SC
At least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.

CAPCOM
Amen to that.

CAPCOM
Okay, it looks like you are coming inside now on the camera.

SC
Well, I can't get in behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in but we are going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we will be seeing coming in now. Guess it maybe two or three minutes before power descent.

SC
All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus and I'm going to move it out to Serenity and then expand the field of view.

SC
Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 02.

CAPCOM
Hello Apollo 11, this is Houston. We see you coming up on the terminator at 7853. It will be about 7 minutes from now and we also got the LOS 02 and TEI 05 pad ready for you after the TV and when you ever want to terminate, over.

The outlines are just barely able to be seen.

CAPCOM
Roger, I think we can make them out. The color really enhances the ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.

SC
Right, at these low sun angles there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the acre says, it has a look of plaster paris to it, at this sun angle which is completely lacking in earth angle.

CAPCOM
Roger.

PAO
We're now some 25 minutes into our television pass.

SC
Okay this is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Maryland, a triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen. At the present time with crater secchi (garbled) on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.

CAPCOM
Roger, we're getting a good view of mount Maryland and Secchi satum.

SC
And now we're looking at what we call boot hill, occurs 20 seconds into the descent.

PAO
Watching this pass with a great deal of interest here in mission control center is Pete Conrad, the commander for the Apollo 12 mission.

SC
On the right edge of the screen crater censorinus P. Now passing the 1 minute point in power descent.

CAPCOM
Roger, and for your information your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.

SC
It should be. I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.

CAPCOM
I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.

SC
I wouldn't be surprised.

SC
We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of the moon craters that were photographed by Apollo 10, and the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50 thousand feet.

CAPCOM
Roger, we can observe there also steep even from this altitude. You've got quite a shadow being casted by the sun at these low angles.

SC
The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the sun was quite high above us. The crater in the, bright crater

in the center of the screen, the smaller one is censorinus.

CAPCOM
Roger, and we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.

SC
How's the brightness of that picture you're receiving? Do you think we ought to open F-stop some as we approach the terminator.

CAPCOM
Yea, the brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic white level compensation seems to be working beautifully.

SC
There's a good picture of Boot Hill.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
3 minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.

CAPCOM
Roger, we're seeing Boot Hill now.

SC
The next crater coming into the bottom of Duke Island there, and to the left, the crater, the largest of the craters, near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our downrange position check, and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.

CAPCOM
Roger, I imagine you get a, you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.

SC
(garbled) is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.

SC
That's a good name too. Sidewinder, and Diamondback, it looks like a couple of snakes down there in the lake bed.

SC
And we're approaching the terminator now. See the (garbled) has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. The picture is getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the F-stop.

SC
Landing point is just barley in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small well defined crater is Moltke, which is about a beam in the landing sight.

CAPCOM
Roger, we can just see it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.

CAPCOM
And we can make out just barley some features on the surface, maybe from earth shine.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 15:20  -  GET 78:48  -  TAPE 242/3

CAPCOM
Are you wide open on the F-stop, at this time.

SC
Now we are. Yea and it looks like we're just about to get the sun comming into the lens so we'll have to move the camera light.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
We can't see any earth shine or any surface features at all in earth shine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows, as compared to the terminator.

CAPCOM
Yes it's a very beautiful and rugged sight we've got on the screen now.

SC
And I think you've got some interesting data on thrustor firing versis pitch angle. It looks like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface is all.

CAPCOM
Roger, I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for, I believe.

SC
And as the moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.

CAPCOM
Roger, we sort of thought it was the sun setting in the east.

PAO
There you have it. Our first glimpse of the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission. The eleven crew took us on a guided tour of the front side, plus talked their way through the power descent that lies ahead in tomorrows activities.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We are some 20 minutes away, at this time, of ignition for lunar orbit insertion burn number 2. This - the fine tune second burn in the series of two as we have inserted into lunar orbit. For LOI2, the Apollo 11 will be heads down. The burn will be initiated near perilune as the spacecraft passes over the far side of the moon. Retrograde, like LOI1, but unlike Apollo's 8 and 10. The burn will not be targeted to place a spacecraft into a precise circular orbit. Taking what was learned on Apollo 10, this LOI2 burn is designed to take into account predicted perturbations and gradually circularize itself. The numbers that we're looking at for LOI2, that would be time of ignition, 80 hours 11 minutes 36 Seconds, which should change our orbital parameters, giving us an apolune of 65.7 nautical miles and a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. The Delta-V intended for this burn, 159.2 feet per second. Burn duration anticipated 17 seconds. That's a burn of short duration, but certainly important in that it establishes the proper orbital parameters for the events that lie ahead. As you heard in earlier conversation,

between our capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless and crewmembers aboard the spacecraft. We're GO for LOI 2. During this burn, we'll utilize only the bank A ball valve. The bank referred to here, which there are two mechanisms that drive the ball valves open and shut, causing fuel and oxidizer to mix for ignition. At the present time in Mission Control Center, the last reference you've heard from our capsule communicator reflects that they, on their own peculiar shift schedule, are having a change of shift. Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene and we can assume will take over the responsibilities of the conversational flow with the Apollo 11 spacecraft, once we reacquire. At 79 hours 55 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Our current altitude shows 54.7 nautical miles, apolune, 65.4, perilune, 53.8. Interestingly enough, the part of the LM activation which we will follow up most closely will be at time of reacquisition following our pass over the far side of the moon. This will be on the front side. It will afford us an opportunity for a communications check with the lunar module and there will be a transfer to LM power.

Apollo 11 has passed out of range with the ground, traversing now over the far side of the Moon. During this pass, we had an extremely successful communications checkout with the lunar module using its code name for the first time. Its code name of the Eagle. Buzz Aldrin performed the counting tasks in concert with Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator here on the ground, and at times Buzz's - Buzz's voice, we noted considerable enthusiasm for the way things are going, and at times Charlie Duke shared that enthusiasm and its maiden checkout in communications, the lunar module Eagle, looked good.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 84 hours and 28 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We're less than 2 minutes away now from our scheduled time of acquisition with Apollo 11. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center, Astronaut Owen Garriott has now replaced Charlie Duke as our Capsule Communicator. We expect that some final advisories will be passed to the Apollo 11 crew, and final report says such as crew status will be received from Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin prior to the start of their sleep period.

This is Apollo Control, Houston. Owen Garriott getting ready to place a call.

CAPCOM
Over.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACT went very well just because you came around the LM. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.

SC
Go ahead. Over.

CAPCOM
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks. Everything went fine. I would like to remind you though tomorrow you may see an asc>ent pressure light when you activate the MC and W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the AP - OP tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but the below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been disolved into the propellant. Over.

SC
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.

CAPCOM
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, and you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in REG COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters that will couple REG into your yaw and roll axes, and the - you were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling REG's into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.

SC
Yes, that may be true. It's very peculiar coupling in that it waits longer than you would think and its

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 20:59  -  GET 84:28  -  TAPE 262/2

SC
reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second per panel.

CAPCOM
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.

SC
Okay. Fine.

CAPCOM
They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various track locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumables budget, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your work quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.

SC
Okay, I got the O2 fuel cell purge. You want them now?

CAPCOM
I'll have to stand by just a moment.

SC
Okay. And then the other one is we're still charging battery A.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the back side of the moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.

SC
Okay; understand, I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning, I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.

CAPCOM
That's fine, Buzz.

SC
Terminate battery charging now.

CAPCOM
That's right and one other systems item here - in order to balance your cryo tanks, would you get your O2 and tank 1 and your H2 tank 2 heaters off. Over.

SC
Okay, I have O2 tank heater I off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.

CAPCOM
That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
One Other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page Fll-9 there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top - under tunnel at the top of page 11-9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead

check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.

SC
Understand and note has been made in my checklist.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a presleep check for us before you go to bed.

At 84 hours 40 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

SC
Hey Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
11, Houston, go ahead.

SC
Roger. We're thinking about taking the monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use, over.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight. We're receiving noisy data at this time. We've requested Apollo 11 to give us a manual relock. Standing by at 84 hours, 49 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. We request you go to MANUAL from wide beam width. The Pitch and Yaw angles in your checklist. You should be able to find us there. Over.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now?

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Loud and clear this time. OMNI.

SC
Loud and clear. You faded out on your other transmissions. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Are you in wide-beam now?

SC
Negative, but I've got you locked back on again REACQING now.

CAPCOM
Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?

SC
Sure don't. We're showing the background - 15 degrees for the pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.

CAPCOM
We concur that. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the LM for this passage. Over.

SC
That's confirmed.

CAPCOM
Thank you.

This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 56 minutes are now in the flight of Apollo 11. Our current apolune 65.1 nautical miles, current perilune 54.3 nautical miles. After receiving some noisy signal, Apollo 11 has locked back on in fine form. That was Buzz Aldrin speaking with Owen Garriott here in the Mission Control Center. I expect we will take a second look at why we had to lock on manually. As we receive any updates on this, we'll pass them along. We now read 84 hours, 57 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

SC
Go ahead Houston.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S-band and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds, then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition, over.

SC
Okay, we understand.

CAPCOM
Eleven Houston, we also would appreciate if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire, over.

SC
Roger, we'll do that.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 21:44  -  GET 85:13  -  TAPE 266/1

CAPCOM
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.

SC
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved towards 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, we're setting on about 15 degrees pitch and roll about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, oh, about 30 degrees apiece and then they picked right back on up again. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Some of the luckiest people in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. You give us the location of your pitch and yaw location of your position indicators. Over.

SC
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now, about 15 degrees pitch and - No, wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 75 instead of 265.

CAPCOM
Okay, thank you.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.

SC
Okay.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 85 hours 17 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. What you heard in the conversation between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin was following a communications check in which we secured the uplink carrier for some 30 seconds and waited to give it a period of time of approximately 3 minutes, to see if the spacecraft would reacquire. We appeared to reacquire in fine form on this first test. We will repeat it - this test a second time, delaying approximately 4 minutes before we place a call to Apollo 11. At 85 hours 17 minutes, we currently read an altitude - spacecraft altitude of 56.1 nautical miles. Present velocity shows 5,367 feet per second. At apolune 65 nautical miles, perilune 54.4 nautical miles. Present weight in orbit remains a static 70,502 pounds. Present time in orbit as shown on our displays, 1 hour 58 minute 40 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaves?

SC
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and then the yaw went to about 255, 245 to 255 and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-19-69     CDT 21:44  -  GET 85:13  -  TAPE 266/2

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles of 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles, or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire. Over.

SC
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off, gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now, and they the signal strength, would take several jumps as evidentally it goes from wide to medium to narrow.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. I understand, and on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.

SC
Roger. Zero.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've run 2 tests thus far with the S-band antenna which has reacquired nicely on both occasions. While we are standing by for further possible conversations with the crew at this time, we' re some 50 minutes from predicted time of loss of signal on Apollo 11. Currently we read an apolune of 65 nautical miles - a perilune of 54.4 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

Roger, 11, and we got about 14 minutes to LOS. AOS is about 86:30, a hour away. We are wondering whether or not you planned to have one up at that time or would ya'll like to be asleep inside the next hour?

SC
Somebody will be up.

CAPCOM
Roger. The thing that we are still puzzling on is the antenna and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.

SC
Okay, we'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're still finishing up dinner.

CAPCOM
Rog, Mike thank you.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 29 minutes now into the flight. That was Mike Collins reporting to the capsule communicator Owen Garriott that the Apollo 11 crew completing dinner at this time. And earlier perhaps if you listened to the air/ground, you heard some music in the background, soft music which would indicate that the this was being played in concert with their evening meal. When we reacquire, we expect one of the three crew members to still be, at least one to be still awake as we run a further check on our spacecraft antenna. At 85 hours 30 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Okay, we just appeared to get a solid lock from the last, oh about a minute. The tune-for-max needle has been wandering up and down and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just finishing up our fuel cell purge hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off. They'll be coming off just in a second.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. Apollo 11, Houston. We believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous rev. It looks like it was a receiver power supply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. Over.

SC
Okay, glad to hear.

11, that really winds things up as far as we're concerned on the ground for the evening. We're ready to go to bed and get a little sleep. Over.

SC
Yeah, we're about to join you.

CAPCOM
Rog.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 86 hours, 33 minutes. You heard that last exchange. The Mission Control Center has isolated our earlier loss of lock on with the S-Band antenna to a faulty power supply to Goldstone which in turn introduced noisy data causing a ground based receiver to go out of lock. This power supply, a 24 volt one, has already been replaced at Goldstone. In summary, the spacecraft looks good and the difficulty was caused here on the ground. At 86 hours, 34 minutes, we now read our orbit at 64.9 nautical miles apolune, 54.6 nautical miles paralune. This is Apollo Control, Houston. This is Apollo Control, Houston at 86 hours, 52 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current altitude on the Apollo 11 spacecraft now reads 64.9 nautical miles. This corresponds with our apolune of 64.9 nautical miles. Our perilune on this pass 54.6 nautical miles. We've had no further conversation with the Apollo 11 crew nor do we expect to do so.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 87 hours, 31 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 spacecraft continues on it's front side pass above the moon. We're now less than 10 minutes away from loss of signal. The Apollo 11 crew in - currently in their rest period. We've received no indication yet that any of the crew members are actually sleeping, although all three appear to be in a very restful mode. This will be the final sleep period for the crew. Now at the threshold of their prime mission objective for the final sleep period prior to landing on the lunar surface and returning. The next scheduled rest period will in fact take place on the surface of the moon. We are now past mid night Central Daylight Time. It is now July 20., the day scheduled for lunar landing. Our current orbital parameters read apolune 67. - correction 64.7 nautical miles, paralune 54.8 nautical miles.., Current spacecraft altitude 54.8 nautical miles. Our time of orbit or little period remains the same 1 hour, 58 minutes, 40 seconds. So at 87 hours, 30 minutes, we wil'l continue to stand by in the event that we have any conversation with the crew.

This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 16 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft in its 12th revolution of the moon. At this time Armstrong and Aldrin should be completing pressure checks on their spacesuits. Coming up in this revolution, they will be running checks on the guidance platform of their LM guidance system. They will also be running checks on the reaction control system thrusters and their descent propulsion system, as well as the rendezvous radar. We will also be giving them the GO/NO GO for undocking in the following revolution. The checkout and activation up to this point has been moving along very smoothly. All systems performing well and we were ahead of the flight plan at the end of the last revolution. We will stand by now to reacquire the spacecraft. The LM and CSM are still docked and Armstrong and Aldrin within the LM. That will be their home for the next 30 hours or so. Now about 45 seconds from reacquiring. We are now about 15 seconds from reacquisition of Apollo 11. Spacecraft currently in an orbit with an apocynthion of 63 and one-half nautical miles and pericynthian of 55.9, as we are continuing to see the apocynthion drop and pericynthian raise as the orbit becomes more and more circular. We should have acquisition of signals shortly. We will have some noise on the circuits until the LM ,steerable and the CSM high gain antennas are brought into play.

to take marks on a landmark near the prime landing site. This information will be received here in Mission Control and will be used to update the Ground's knowledge of where the spacecraft is, and in turn that information will assist them in setting the precise time for the powered descent. Once the orbital navigation is completed we'll be able to get a high gain antenna and LM steerable antenna lock and we should see some improvement in the communications.

Roger. In the first of - on page 47 step 1 we had the guidance control in PGNCS and mode control PGNCS AUTO and of course the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet. So when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 and we're looking at NOUN 47 now, so we've got an RCS CWA light and we've got 4 out of the 8 other bright colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in PGNCS and AUTO and unable to fire the thrusters. Over.

Out of contact - out of radio contact, the DOI maneuver scheduled to come at 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and it will be a 76.4 foot per second burn. The burn duration 29.8 seconds, and the resulting orbit for the LM will be 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles. When next we acquire the lunar module, it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles on its way down to a low point of about 50,000 feet from where the powered descent to the lunar surface will begin. As the spacecraft went around the corner, all systems on both vehicles looked very good. Everything is GO here in mission control and aboard the spacecraft for the descent orbit insertion to occur in 6 minutes, 38 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 101 hours 29 minutes.

This is Apollo Control at lOl hours, 35 minutes. We're. now. less than one minute from the scheduled time for the descent orbit insertion maneuver performed by the lunar module on the backside of the moon. Of course, we don't have radio contact with the spacecraft. In mission control here normally maneuvers of that sort would be monitored on plot boards in front, and we have the boards set up there for the powered descent. To occur about 1/2 rev from now over landing site 1. Flight controllers standing around in little groups. Not much that we can do at this point until reacquiring spacecraft. We're now 20 minutes - or 20 seconds rather from ignition on the descent orbit insertion. It will be a 29.8 second burn of the 9800-pound thrust descent propulsion system. We should be burning at this time. The result of this maneuver will be to put the spacecraft into an orbit 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles, and it would remain in that orbit until powered descent.

PAO
We should have a cut off by this time. That should have completed descent orbit insertion maneuver. We would expect to reacquire the command module first. Command module acquisition time is 102 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. That will be just about 2 minutes prior to the time that we will have reacquired the lunar module. The LM acquisition time is 102 hours, 16 minutes, 25 secomds. That is about 37 minutes, 20 seconds from now on the CSM at about a little less than 2 minutes longer than that for the LM.

I believe back in the viewing room, we probably have one of the largest assemblages of space officials that we've ever seen in one place. Included among the viewers are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Jim Elms, Director of the Electronic Research Center at Cambridge, Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of NASA's Lewis Research Center, Rocco Petrone, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center is there. From Marshall Space Center, we have Dr. Wernher von Braun, the Director, and his Deputy, Dr. Eberhard Rees. Also a large number of Astronauts including Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, Jim McDivitt, and John Glenn. We also see Dr. Kurt Debus, Director of the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Edgar Cortright, Director of the Langley Research Center. Dr. S. Draper, Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentations Laboratory is also in the viewing room. Here in the control room proper down on the floor a number of Astronauts including Pete Conrad, Fred Haise, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and Donald K.

We're now 2 minutes 53 seconds from reacquring the spacecraft, 21 minutes 23 seconds from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface. It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control. A few moments ago Flight Director Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and closed with a remark "Good luck to all of you". Here on the front of our display boards we have a number of big plot boards which will be used to keep track of the burn progress. Along the more important of those is one which will show the performance on onboard guidance systems, both the primary and the back up guidance system and compare the guidance systems with the Manned Space Flight Network tracking. These displays, by the time this is all over, will look a great deal like a combination Christmas tree and Fourth of July. We're now 1 minute 39 seconds from reacquiring the command module, Columbia. Acquisition of the lunar module will come a little less than 2 minutes after that. At the time we acquire the LM it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles descending toward the 50,000 foot pericynthion from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated. If for any reason the crew does not like the way things look as they are coming across the pericynthion, simply by not initiating the maneuver they will remain in a safe orbit of 60 miles by 50,000 feet, and if they desired they would be able to attempt the powered descent on the following revolution at a ground elapsed time of about 104 hours 26 minutes. We're now coming up on 30 seconds to acquisition of the command module and we'll stand by for that event.

Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase. The auto targeting was taking us right into a football field, football field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about 1 or 2 crater diameters around us, and it required a (garbled) on the 366 and flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.

We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shapes, angularities, granularities, every variety of rock you could find. The colors vary pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the 0 phase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all, however it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though there going to have some interesting colors to them, over.

The Czar has said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are the winners today. We were a little busy, worrying about program alarms and things like that. Part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot and aside from a good look at several of the craters we seen over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizons. I haven't had the reference as yet.

Window is a relatively level plain crated with a fairly large number of craters of the five to fifty foot radi and from ridges small 20, 30 feet high I would guess and literally thousands of little one and two foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us, difficult to estimate but might be a half a mile or a mile.

Roger Tranquility. We copy. Over.

COLUMBIA
Sounds like it looks a lot better now than it did yesterday at that very low sun angle. It looked rough as a cob then.

CAPCOM
Roger, tranquility. We understand. It must be a beautiful sight. Over.

PAO
We would like to point out that the fuel pressure problem that had been called to the attention of the crew, is in the descent system and it is probably the downstream of the tanks where a small amount of fluid has been trapped in a line and we don't expect it to cause any problem. The line should be able to take far more pressure than the fluid would exert. In the event that there was an overpressurization, we would expect that the line would spring a small leak, the pressure would drop rapidly. Again, we point out that we do not see this as a significant problem.

CAPCOM

This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal now from the command module and of course, we'll maintain constant communications with the lunar module on the lunar surface. We have some heart rates for Nell Armstrong during that power descent to the lunar surface. At the time the burn was initiated, Armstrong's heart rate was 110. At touchdown on the lunar surface, he had a heart rate of 156 beats her minute, and the flight surgeon reports that his heart rate is now in the 90's. We do not have biomedical on Buzz Aldrin.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 32 minutes. We have an update on that touchdown time on the lunar surface. This still is not the final, official time which we will get from readout of data, but the refined time is 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds, which would have been 12 minutes 36 seconds after initiating the powered descent. That was 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds for touchdown and a total time of powered descent 12 minutes 36 seconds, and we would expect then those numbers to change perhaps a little when we get final data readouts.

This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 44 minutes. There will be a brief statement from Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, in the building 1 autitorium at 4:30. We also have some updated information on the landing point. It appears that the spacecraft, Eagle, touched down at 799 degrees north, or just about on the lunar equator. And 23.46 degrees longitude, which would have put it about 4 miles from the targeted landing point downrange.

PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 104 hours 44 minutes. You heard that last exchange and there is a very strong indication we might have an early EVA with the hatch opend perhaps at 8:00 Houston time. One other item of significance that this the pressure rise in - depth descent propellant line downstage of the tanks has relieved all aspects of the mission, looking very good at this time. At 104 hours 45 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 105 hours now into the flight of Apollo 11. We expect a - our - our capsule communicator Owen Garriott to pass along data to spacecraft Columbia, momentarily. We're standing by for that. Meanwhile, I think we should discuss a little further the projected EVA. Our current plan is to have crewmembers above the Eagle to eat and relax for a little while prior to starting EVA preps. We won't know with certainity or have a reasonable time hack until about an hour before the scheduled event. Right it looks like it could occur at 8:00 Houston time. We have conversation going now with the spacecraft. We'll pick that up.

We'd like you to let the auto optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the Lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course.

Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two old-1ooking craters. Over.

COLUMBIA
Roger, Houston. Columbia no joy I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time, hoping I'd get a flash of vector light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my skim areas that you suggested.

CAPCOM
Roger. On that - southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater in the southern rim of - one slot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.

Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sighting. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Poppa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.

COLUMBIA
Stand by one.

CAPCOM
Roger.

COLUMBIA
Houston, Columbia.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Columbia.

COLUMBIA
Well, the craters I was telling you about is located exactly at Mike 6. 7.

CAPCOM
Roger. We found that one.

COLUMBIA
The other one was located at 7 - the other one was located at 7.2 - just turns it away from Mike to Nan.

CAPCOM
Roger. We believe you're looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Understand. I was looking where our optics was tracking on the average and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west. Actually, a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?

CAPCOM
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature to that was just gravity of the small bright crater around the rim of the large fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.

COLUMBIA
Well, just give me your best estimate as the new location and the coordinance system and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.

Houston, Columbia. Did you enable the S-band relay at least one way affirm Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?

CAPCOM
Roger. There's not much going on at the present time, Columbia. I'll see what I can do about the relay.

CAPCOM
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you aware that Eagle plans the EVA about 4 hours early? Over.

COLUMBIA
Affirmative. When's hatch open time in GET estimated?

CAPCOM
Roger. Somewhere around 108 hours. We'll have an update for you in that a little later.

COLUMBIA
Okay, I haven't heard a word from those guys, and I thought I'd be hearing them through your S-band relay.

CAPCOM
Roger. They're about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.

COLUMBIA
Glad to hear it.

Go ahead.

CAPCOM
On your next pass Columbia rather than performing a P22 as scheduled, we would like you to look into the center of the coordinates we gave you which is our best analysis based on MAP physics trajectory and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on an interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on the way down. The coordinates of this second site are MIKE .7 and 8.0. I say again. MIKE .7 and 8.0. Over.

COLUMBIA
Roger, copy. MIKE .7 and 8.0. The only thing is my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I bring the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time or don't you think -

CAPCOM
Roger, if you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want, over.

COLUMBIA
Okay.

CAPCOM
And if you can find the LM then by all means track it or make a note of where is was and we can track it on the next rev. If you are ready we have a RFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time if you will give us P00 and accept, over.

COLUMBIA
Okay, P00 and accept you got and this is an updated landing site RSFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?

There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at 1/6g that we performed in the simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. There's about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but very insignificant amount. Okay, Buzz, we're ready to bring down the camera.

About 2 to 3 or maybe 4 easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. Next direction like a football player, you just have to split out to the side and cut a little bit.

I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you ... for every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans, in recognizing what a feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to double our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth. For one priceless moment, in the whole history of man, all the people on this earth are truly one. One in their pride in what you have done. And one in our prayers, that you will return safely to earth.

Still have not fully configured the voice communications, however, we are getting telemetry - good telemetry from Tranquiltity Base showing a cabin pressure of 5 pounds per square inch, temperature of 60 degrees. We expect to establish communications before too long. During this period the crew is removing the portable life support systems, checking over their spacecrafts systems, getting ready for jettisoning equipment from Tranquillity Base. The cabin will be depressurized before too long and equipment will be jettisoned onto the lunar surface.

Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. We can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission. It's your option. How do you feel? Over.

TRANQUILITY
I guess we can pick them up now.

CAPCOM
Okay, and your friendly green team here is pretty well been relieved by your friendly maroon team, and I'll put Ward on with the questions.

TRANQUILITY
Okay. Thank you, Bruce.

CAPCOM
Tranquility, Houston. First question here is your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal of crew flight plan. Over.

TRANQUILITY
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow, we probably have about 13 degrees left of the shadow.

CAPCOM
Roger, that's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA, and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.

TRANQUILITY
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizeable number of selective rocks of different types.

CAPCOM
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was selected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.

TRANQUILITY
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at (garbled)

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 3:03  -  GET 114:21  -  TAPE 385/2

TRANQUILITY
the variation with depth at ... with the bulk sample, that there really was an appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, other types and other areas where I got just a short distance - an inch or two - and couldn't go any further.

CAPCOM
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitations, and wonder if you would be able to divide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.

TRANQUILITY
We got 2 core tubes and a solar wind, and about half of a big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked hurriedly around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.

CAPCOM
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which luminate from the DPS engine burning area. We were wondering if the rays luminating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.

TRANQUILITY
The ones that I saw back in the back end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker, and of course, viewed from the aft end, well they did have the sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Understand that near the aft end up to the eve, that the rays did appear to be darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending out. Is that correct?

TRANQUILITY
No, I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way covered to be more cohesive and perhaps go together or something - I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started traveling around out front, why we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show that. But, that didn't extend very far. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, Tranquility. And, this

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 3:03  -  GET 114:21  -  TAPE 385/3

CAPCOM
is great concern that you've described or at least suggested - your suggestion was that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -

TRANQUILITY
I believe so.

CAPCOM
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the moon during deployment? Over.

TRANQUILITY
I think that two corners did touch just when it was deployed but both of them did come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly and of course the crane that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch, 3/4 to 1/2 an inch deep and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners, and I think these are on the western ones. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Understand the description and the next subject on the 2 core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these two - -


END OF TAPE


APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 3:14  -  GET 114:42  -  TAPE 386/1

CAPCOM
- the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over.

TRANQUILITY
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it and the second one took 2 hands on the handle and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there it didn't for some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that it would support it and I'd keep it from falling over if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continuing hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it into a total depth of 8 or 9 inches and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical. That they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?

TRANQUILITY
Yeah, that's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - the way it adhered to the cord tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. I understand the general impression of being moist as packed in the cord tube. Next question. We did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have anymore lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.

TRANQUILITY
We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow, okay.

CAPCOM
Yes indeed. That will be fine. Just a couple more here and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.

TRANQUILITY
Well, I could do it like this. About all the struts are about equally stroked and the heighth from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet.

CAPCOM
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, just after landing you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the left. Are there

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 3:14  -  GET 114:42  -  TAPE 386/2

CAPCOM
large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray. Over.

TRANQUILITY
No, I don't believe so. I think that it's about as level as any other area is that we chose.

CAPCOM
Roger.

TRANQUILITY
There's nothing large anyway that's going to get in the way.

CAPCOM
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appears from the television I think and now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your flight to the landing spot you had passed over a football field size crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football size crater from your present position? Over.

TRANQUILITY
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.

CAPCOM
Roger, so you estimate your present position less than a half mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.

TRANQUILITY
That's correct.

CAPCOM
Okay, you all. That takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight and unless you have something else that will be all from us for the evening. Over.

TRANQUILITY
Okay, thank you.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 8:42  -  GET 121:00  -  TAPE 394/1

PAO
This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft Columbia has gone behind the moon on the twenth third lunar revolution. Be acquired again at - well, let's see now, it looks like we don't have acquisition table up yet for next rev. During this pass and the short conversation toward the end of the front side pass with Columbia, the network transmitters have been arranged so that the transmissions would not disturb the crew of Eagle who at this time should be asleep. Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins is experiencing during this 47 minutes of each lunar revolution when he's behind the moon with no one to talk to except his tape recorder aboard Columbia. While he waits for his comrades to soar with Eagle from Tranquility Base and rejoin him for the trip back to earth, Collins, with the help of flight controllers here in Mission Control center has kept the command module's system going "pocketa-pocketapocketa". At 120 hours, 12 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. Let's join the call to Tranquility Base.

CAPCOM
How is the resting stand up there, or did you get a chance to curl up on the engine camp?

EAGLE
Roger, Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a weight gutter, and he's been lying on the hatch and engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger. Copy, Buzz. We've got a couple of changes to your surface check-1ist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P-22 tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. This will be - in other words, P-57, P-22, and then press on (garble) with the check list, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the check list. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we expect that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms that we're getting during descent.

EAGLE
Okay, we had the rendezvous radar in slew during descent though.

CAPCOM
Traquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.

EAGLE
Roger, I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the P00 position, not the LCG position.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - there's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes if you want to get out your surface check list and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.

EAGLE
Allright, go ahead. I've got it out.

CAPCOM
Okay, before we start here, request P00 and data and we'll give you some vectors.

EAGLE
You've got P00 and data.

CAPCOM
Okay, and on surface 50 will be the first change there.

EAGLE
Okay, and I understand you want us to do a P-57 option 3 and then a P-22. Is that the general idea? Over.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, so on the surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after pro after 2 recycles, stick in a time of 1:22 plus 15, do P 22 as per ping 20 of G and N dictionary. Over.

EAGLE
Roger, understand that's 1:22 15 to P-22 as per pings 20 G and N dictionary.

CAPCOM
Roger. Okay let's skip on over to surface 59.

EAGLE
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, this is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank, so at the top of the page just after

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 10:13  -  GET 121:40  -  TAPE 395/2

CAPCOM
EPS invertor 1 close, add - okay after EPS invertor 1 closed, add prop, descent helium red flash vent close, and then after stabilization control, AELD close, add prop displays flash engine overide flash logic close. Over.

EAGLE
Roger, copy. These are 2 circuit breakers, right?

CAPCOM
Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.

CAPCOM
Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those 2 on the proportion circuit breakers?

EAGLE
Roger, I have those 2.

CAPCOM
Okay, let's go over to surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then add the switches -

EAGLE
Roger, go ahead then.

CAPCOM
Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN add descent propulsion fuel vent open add descent propulsion oxidizer vent open add verify talkback gray. Over.

EAGLE
Roger. Descent propellant fuel vent open, descent propellant oxidizer vent open verify talkback gray.

CAPCOM
Roger, you've got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to surface 61 down there at T minus 17.

EAGLE
Roger, I'm there. Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, at t minus 17, delete CB 11, AC Bus A, rendezvous radar closed wait 30 seconds, delete PGNCS rendezvous radar close, and then add updated link switch to voice backup. Over.

EAGLE
Roger, I have that. Leave those 2 circuit breakers open, and have the updated link to voice backup, and we'll make the appropiate changes on the following circuit breaker status cards.

CAPCOM
Roger, and you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - NOTE: - this is the bottom of page 61 - NOTE: Do not use tapemeter in PGNCS, i.e., do not place mode select switch to ping. Over.

EAGLE
Okay. We'll put it in AGS.

CAPCOM
Roger, that's fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 10:23  -  GET 121:50  -  TAPE 396/1

CAPCOM
Okay, that's all the changes we have the checklist here, I've got some - just the general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information, over.

EAGLE
Okay, and then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.

CAPCOM
Roger, we agree wholeheartedly. And while your starting on that, I'll read, just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as describing on things 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. Rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate bail. Key A proceed and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the Range Altitude Monitor Switch in altitude, altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.

EAGLE
Roger, I think I have that.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. A little over 2 minutes until Columbia comes over the hill again on the 24th Lunar Revolution. In that wake up call to Eagle, the crew described how they slept in the spacecraft by lying on the floor and on the engine cover. Some of the preliminary times being generated now ascent show ignition about 1 minute 26 seconds earlier than the premission flight plan. Ignition time now showing 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds. Burn will have a magnitude of 6,068 feet per second. Quite a bit of that will be in vertical rise and actually starting from zero feet per second on the lunar surface. The CSI maneuver behind the moon, the Concentric Sequence Initiate, CSI the acronym being for that maneuver. 125 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds. Consistent Delta heighth CDH 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds. Terminal Phase initiation 126 hours 57 minutes 0 seconds, and Terminal Phase Finialization or the final breaking before docking 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. These are Ground computations. And they will be computed by the crew from radar tracking, rendezvous radar. So actually these number computed on the Ground are somewhat academic in that they will be computed in real time by the crew. We're standing by here for Capcom to resume conversation. During this up coming pass here, more definite fix on the Eagle positions will be attempted by using the rendezvous radar from the Eagle in Program 22, rendezvous radar lunar surface navigation program. The transponder on Columbia in the meantime has been warmed up. During the last revolution, Mike Collins was advised to - have the - the transponder warmed up. As of now, the exact location is somewhat vague. And perhaps this rendezvous radar exercise will give a final, more pinpoint location of where Eagle does indeed nest on the moon. We'll continue to monitor the airground circuit. We've had acquisition of signal with Columbia, so likely the conversation will increase here as we get the

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-21-69     CDT 10:23  -  GET 121:50  -  TAPE 396/2

We had alot of help down there, didn't we.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal with Columbia going behind the moon. Toward the end of that pass, Apollo 11 backup commander, Jim Lovell, who's had some experience in Lunar missions came up with his congratulations with his job-well-done. He mentioned that he would be here giving moral support during the rendezvous sequence to follow. There are likely to be further communications with Eagle until the command mmodule comes around the corner again some 44 minutes from now We'll bring the circuit back up as communications resume perhaps playing catch up with tape recordings, and at 123 hours, 10 minutes ground elapsed time, 1 hour, 11 minutes to ignition this is Apollo - stand by. We may be - let's listen in again.

TRANQUILITY
Going to give you a few comments with regards to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively clear crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters most of which have rims irrespective of their rays and irrespective of their size. That's not universally true. There are a few of the smaller craters around which do now have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I say the thing that would be most like it on earth is the powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying inconsistencies as I said I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and particular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent, and the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed, and in our traverse around the surface and particularly working with the scoop we can run into boulders below the surface probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.

CAPCOM
Tranquility, Houston. Roger, very fine description.

TRANQUILITY
Now I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edge rocky rim crater that we passed over in final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in, but I thought that it might just fit in the astrodome as we came by it, and it runs in the

TRANQUILITY
vacinity of the - this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly poculated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows and irregular patterns, and then there are spans between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of the hard rocks. Over.

Tranquility base, Houston.

EAGLE
Go ahead Houston.

CAPCOM
Roger, for your P57 errors, we did a looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel at a detent 6 would be real good on that. Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel it's about 55 degrees, over.

EAGLE
Roger, Houston, the only trouble is that the sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm unable to use that at all.

CAPCOM
Okay, we understand, out, and thank you.

CAPCOM
Tranquility, Houston, for your information the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.

EAGLE
Roger, I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy.

EAGLE
And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.

EAGLE
And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did return.

CAPCOM
Roger, mighty fine, thank you.

Tranquility, Houston.

EAGLE

CAPCOM
Roger, it looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minutes, that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50 over.

EAGLE
Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar.

CAPCOM
Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.

EAGLE
On our detents, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'll be using right rear, it's okay.

CAPCOM
Roger, that's fine then.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. Some 57 minutes 22 seconds away from ignition on the LM ascent back into lunar orbit. Some 30 minutes away from acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia, as it comes around again on the 25th revolution. And the latest information from the scientific experiment placed on the lunar surface last night by the Apollo 11 crew, our Science Support Room reports receiving continous data from the Passive Seismic Experiment. The Passive Seismic Experiment is part of the early Apollo science experiment package which has the acronym ASEP. Recorded the astronauts footsteps on the moon; also sent down signals when the crew climbed up the ladder back into the Eagle, and recorded a strong signal when they expended Portable Life Support

PAO
This is Apollo Control. Here in mission control center Flight Director Glen Lunney is polling the various positions here in the control room on their readiness to go ahead with the ascent from this next pass as the command module comes around the moon, and we're some 53 minutes now away from ascent. Meanwhile back at the scientific experiment situation, another attempt is scheduled today to shoot another laser beam up to the laser retroreflector, which is the other part of the experiment package left on the moon. The seismic experiment will continue to record and send back measurements to mission control and will probably receive it's strongest signal when the ascent engine ignites and starts Eagle on it's way into lunar orbit and rendezvous with Columbia. There's considerable amount of conversation going on with the crew even though command module Columbia is behind the moon at this time. Rather than disconnect the air-ground line and be in a tape play-back mode, we'll leave a circuit up all the way through to loss of signal on the next rev when both spacecraft will go behind the moon. At 123 hours, 29 minutes, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.

CAPCOM
Tranquility Base, Houston.

TRANQUILITY
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a plans change, but in the worst case it would be up to 30 feet per second, and of course we don't expect that at all.

TRANQUILITY
Okay.

TRANQUILITY
Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on 604.

CAPCOM
Tranquility, Roger, that's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is that correct?

TRANQUILITY
We have one primary canister on board and one secondary. The other primary is out in front of the Z plus B pad. Over.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. Network controller just informed the flight director that items called battle shorts have been installed around the network. These are mechanical shorts of critical power supplies and transmitters and the like, so that before they will go off-1ine, they'll actually burn up in critical phases of the mission. They want to get as much data as possible through the burn, so for that reason any circuit breaking funtion of the equipment is inhibited with these battle shorts. They're not a piece of apparel. In the upcoming ascent some 14 minutes from now, almost 5000 pounds of propellant will be run through the ascent engine to propel the lunar module upper stage or

This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal with Eagle. Quite scratchy as Eagle went over the hill to complete the 25th lunar revolution as it gets to the midpoint on the lunar far side. Ascent burn just completed went quite well on time at 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds ground elapsed time. Coming up on this rev, approximately 10 minutes from now as a matter of fact, will be the concentric sequence initiate maneuver, CSI, which will raise the Eagle's perilune to some 45 nautical miles. Eagle now is in an orbit measuring 9.4 nautical miles at insertion or perilune, and 46.7 at apolune, This CSI maneuver will be made approximately at apolune. Therefore, the effect takes place 180 degrees later and has the effect of raising perilune to the desired 45 nautical miles. This maneuver will take place at 125 hours 19 minutes 34.7 seconds. He will have a DELTA-V or velocity change of 51.5 feet per second. All of these maneuvers, incidentally, in the rendezvous sequence by Eagle will be made by using the reaction control system of Eagle. Following the CSI at 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds a 9.2 foot per second burn, probably mostly a radial burn, at 126 hours 18 minutes will twist the Eagle's orbit to equal distance from the orbit of Columbia, what they call a constant DELTA height, or CDH maneuver. At 126 hours 57 minutes 00 seconds, terminal phase initiation, TPI. In this maneuver the crew visually thrusts along the line of sight toward Columbia when the line of sight is some 27 degrees above the local horizontal. This maneuver will have a magnitude of about 24.9 feet per second, and, in turn, it raises the apolune to 60.5 nautical miles, which is approximately the altitude Columbia's orbiting. Terminal phase finalization. TPF 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. This is the start time for a series of small burns which are a combination of midcourse correction and velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle inwith Columbia and match the velocity so that they stationkeep for a short period for photography, etc., and move on in to docking at approximately 128 hours ground elapsed time. In all of these maneuvers Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver approximately a minute after the Eagle is scheduled to make its maneuver, and if for some reason Eagle can not make the maneuver, Collins would do the exact same maneuver only in reverse so that Columbia would in effect begin a CSM active rendezvous with Eagle. As Eagle went over the hill on the 25th revolution, a velocity was being measured at 5410 feet per second. Eagle's weight somewhat lighter than when it started out in excess of

This is Apollo Control at 129 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 36 minutes 40 seconds from coming around the other side of the moon for reacquisition on the 28th revolution. We're nearing the end of the 27th revolution at this time. On the backside of the moon, Armstrong and Aldrin should be involved in preparing for transferring back to the command module with Mike Collins, and they'll be cleaning up equipment and vacuuming off any particles of dust that remain before transferring to the command module. About 15 minutes after we reacquire we would expect Neil Armstrong to be ready for the transfer to the command module. Buzz Aldrin to follow along behind about 30 or 40 minutes later. Here in Mission Control we're presently completing the shift change. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Glenn Lunney, and the Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. The change of shift briefing is scheduled to occur in the news center at 6 p.m. Central Daylight Time. At 129 hours, 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 16 minutes. We reacquired Apollo 11 about 25 minutes ago, at 129 51. At that time Mike Collins reported that all 3 crewmen were in the command module. The transfer occuring while the spacecraft were on the back side of the moon. They had closed out the LM early and had transferred to the second coolant loop. That decision was made in mission control because the secondary loop was on, the primary loop disabled in the close out process. We did not want to have the LM docked to the CSM for an undue length of time, because the primary guidance system is not cooled. The decision was initially made to jettison the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, however the crew continued ahead of schedule. They were ready to jettison ahead of that time, and Collins reported at 130 10 about, 17 minutes ago, that they were, had jettisoned the LM and said it had departed at several feet per second, and we heard a comment from Buzz Aldrin, that he noticed some cracks in the thermo covering around the LM tunnel, docking area, however he said it did not appear to be a structural crack but merely some cracks in the thermal covering. We are currently scheduled to perform the small reaction control system maneuver with the command and service module for seperation from the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, or about 12 minutes from now. We'll pick up this pass as it began on tape and when we've caught up, we'll continue to follow the activity live.

That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 pad from you

CAPCOM
Rog, we want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can, for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30, correction P47 or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, which ever you want to do, over.

COLUMBIA
Yea, I see Ron was going to give me a P30 pad and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.

COLUMBIA
Roger.

CAPCOM
Columbia, Houston, over.

CAPCOM
Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out and it would fight us all the way around and we'd loose comm with it. We're thinking separating at

This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 48 minutes. We're standing by to reacquire Apollo - Apollo 11. Acquisition should come in about 5 seconds. This revolution should be relatively quiet. We don't have a great deal of activity scheduled. The crew may have time to get something to eat, and here on the ground we will be computing the information needed for their transearth injection burn. We do have data now from the spacecraft. We'll standby for a call to the crew.

CAPCOM
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here, over.

SC
11. Roger.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. We suspect the crew is having something to eat at this time which probably accounts for the relatively quiet period. One of the things that we are watching with interest here in Mission Control is the lunar module. At the time Aldrin and Armstrong left the LM and came back into the service module, they switched over to the secondary cooling loop as part of a test that we are running to determine just how long the primary guidance and navigation system will last without cooling. The primary guidance system is not cooled on the secondary loop which provides backup cooling for the secondary guidance system and it has always been a point of interest as to just how long the primary guidance system will survive without cooling - estimates range up to several hours. The LM TEL COMM Controller reports that at this time we are seeing some rise in the PIPAS. These are the Pulse Integrating Pendulium - Pendulous Accelerometers which - the primary guidance system uses to detect changes in motion and attitude and of course they are an essential item in the - the primary guidance system. We are seeing a gradual rise in temperature but the TEL COMM engineer reports that the primary guidance system still looks very good. At the time the crew reported they were back that Armstrong and Aldrin reported that they were back in the command module, we asked them what time they did switch over to the secondary loop. Armstrong estimated that that occurred about 129 hours 40 minutes which was a little over 2 hours ago. We will continue to monitor the LM and to observe the performance of the primary guidance system. All systems on the command service module continue to function very well at this time and the same can be said for the lunar module. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in a orbit 62.5 nautical miles by 54.2. The spacecraft travelling at a speed of 5349 feet per second.

Roger Neil. Starting off, congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britian and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than sixty percent of the news used across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which we mentioned before has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today, even though it ran 950 000 copies, that it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts has also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace." And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime-free night of the year. And in London a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the moon Before 1970 collected $24 000. That's pretty good odds. You're probably interested in the comments your wive's have made. Neil's Ann had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public and all mankind, the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike,

Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz' Joan said, "Apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the moon." She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved, After the moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown." In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm-damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew. Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and Football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that Broadway Joe had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jet's training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129 000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league-1eading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twinbill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by 4 and 1/2 games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All-Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area, before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you already know. Out.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 29 minutes. That last string of numbers read up to the spacecraft included the information the crew will need to start them on their way back to Earth in about 2 hours, 54 minutes. The time of ignition for the transearth injection burn again is 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. They will burn their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes, 28 seconds and increasing their speed by 3283 feet per second. And our preliminary estimate is that that will put them into the Pacific Ocean at the primary landing site at 195 hours, 18 minutes, 47 seconds, ground elapsed time, or almost precisely on the flight plan. The spacecraft weight at the time they do the transearth injection burn will be 36,691 pounds. We'll continue to stand by for any communication from the spacecraft. We now have about 29 minutes, 30 seconds until the Apollo 11 goes around the corner and behind the moon out of radio contact.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. We're now about 30 seconds from loss of signal with Apollo 11 on the 29th revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 46 minutes. As the spacecraft comes around on its 30th revolution, that will be the next to the last full revolution in lunar orbit. The transearth injection maneuver will be performed at the end of the 30th revolution, just after - actually, just after beginning the 31st revolution of the moon. Apollo 11 is now in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point of 54.2. The current spacecraft velocity is 5,356 feet per second, and we show an orbital weight of 36,691 pounds. We have loss of signal now. We'll be coming back up when we reacquire in about 45 minutes. At 133 hours, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 133 hours 45 minutes. We're now 50 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the 30th revolution of the moon. This will be our last front side pass before transearth injection. On this revolution we'll be passing up to the crew the final computations for their transearth injection maneuver, which is scheduled to occurr at 135 hours 23 minutes 42 seconds, or about 1 hour 38 minutes from now. We should have acquisition of signal now in about 10 seconds. We'll stand by.

PAO
We have acquired the signal from the spacecraft now. We're standing by at this time for a call from the crew or for Capcom Charlie Duke to put in a call to the crew from the ground. We presently show the lunar module in an orbit 63.3 by 56 nautical miles, the command service module is in an orbit 63.2 by 53.9. At the time of the transearth injection burn we expect that the command module will be about 1 mile below the LM and about 20 miles in front of it.

This is Apollo Control. At this time the crew should be involved in their pre-ransearth injection status checks. They will also be aligning the platform on their spacecraft guidance system and will be passing up the final information for the transearth injection burn computed on the ground. A few minutes ago you heard Charlie Duke advise the crew that we show the LM platform is about to go. We've mentioned that prior to leaving the lunar module the crew had deactivated the primary cooling loop placing the secondary cooling loop in operation aboard the LM. This means that the primary guidance system does not get cooling. This is part of a preplanned test to find out just how long the primary guidance system would continue to function without cooling. We had predicted in advance that it would - may not - possibly not last much longer than a hour or so, but at the time Charlie Duke reported the platform had just gone down on the LM, it had been in operation without cooling a little more than four hours. We had an approximate time from the crew of transferring to the secondary cooling loop of about 129 hours 40 minutes and we got the report from Duke that the LM guidance platform was no longer usuable at 133 hours 55 minutes. We'll continue to standby for any further conversation from the crew. We're now one hour twenty minutes ten seconds away from transearth injection which will occur on the backside of the Moon at the beginning of the thirtyfirst revolution.

This is Apollo Control at 134 hours, 10 minutes. We have about 47 minutes, 30 seconds before losing contact with Apollo 11 as it goes behind the moon in preparation for the transearth injection burn. With the burn we would reacquire the spacecraft at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 11 seconds. Without the transearth injection burn on the upcoming revolution we would reacquire at 135 hours, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. The final figures on that burn as passed up to the crew a few minutes ago are as follows: ignition will occur at 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. The burn duration will be 2 minutes, 28 seconds. That will add 3284 feet per second to the spacecraft velocity starting it on its path back to Earth. And we would consume about 10,000 pounds of propellant with that burn. Splash would occur according to our preliminary figures, just about precisely as predicted in the flight plan. We'll continue to monitor now for any further conversation from the spacecraft.

And our LM telecommunications engineer reports that we've just had acquisition of signal from Eagle which is still in lunar orbit. The last fix that we had on Eagle's orbit showed an apogee of 64. 1 and a para - apocynthion rather of 64. 1 and a paracynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. The spacecraft altitude is now climbed to almost 700 nautical miles from the moon. We show a weight of 26,510 pounds.

Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.

SC
Yeah. The transients are more noticeable than on previous burn, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact that we had a light command module but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds I would guess after the burn but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal and seemed to be deadbanding fatherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees inside the center line and after the first couple of - of after the first 20 seconds or so the gimbals were quiet and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates-total attitude hung in there pretty well.

This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the taped conversation. We'll stand by for any further live communication from the crew before they begin their sleep period. We've gotten some preliminary figures from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transearth injection burn after a reveiw of the telemetry data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal. Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost precisely as predicted or planned in the flight plan. That would be at 195 hours and 18 minutes, 40 seconds ground elapse time. And we would expect that splash down time to change some what during the transearth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for midcourse correction becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles from the moon

Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it is about 40 feet from the LM in the 11 o'clock position. Over.

ARMSTRONG
No, it's about in the 9 or 9:30 position and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.

CAPCOM
Roger. Copy. Also did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.

ARMSTRONG
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM went out in all directions and usually in the same distance as far as I can tell, but I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud.

CAPCOM
Roger. I understand all you could see were parts of the LM going out. What was your first comment on it?

ARMSTRONG
It was Kapton and other parts of the LM of staging scattering all around the area at great distances but I didn't see a dust cloud.

Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to extend our damping period for another 5 minutes, let the rates get way down. Over.

SC
11. Roger.

PAO
This is Apollo control at 137 hours, 27 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of about 4982 feet per second. At about 5900 nautical miles from the moon, and about 198,900 nautical miles from earth. A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene on the lunar surface at the time the planned ascent stage lifted off. Armstrong reported seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton, which is a plasticlike insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is found on the outside surface of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes, about 40 minutes or so ago that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived of the coolant, a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant. The platform apparently begin to become unuseable after about 4 hours, and the computer itself finally gave up after about 7 hours, 13 minutes. Both items going considerably longer than had previously been predicted. The lunar module ascent stage still in lunar orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. All other systems appear to be functioning well at this time. The LM orbit we show as currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And, the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and here's a call to the crew.

CAPCOM
Over.

SC
Thank you, Charlie, and I think we'll bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 - correction - we have 8 pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules of which - let me correct that. We have 7 pockets of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving 6 remaining. And, the other side, over there in the BT, we have another container with 7 pockets, so we have a total of 7 plus 6 and those are filled with 6 chlorines and 7 buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point and time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to (garbled) you right on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date like maybe tomorrow. Over.

This is Apollo Control at 146 hours. We have heard nothing from the crew. We assume they are still asleep, and that sleep period began at about 137 hours, 47 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is 28,421 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at a speed of 4322 feet per second. The decision on midcourse correction number 5 is still tending toward not doing that midcourse, however the decision hasn't been made final, and there will be some additional tracking prior to firming up that decision. At this point it appears that the midcourse path number 5 opportunity would require about 4 to 5 feet per second. By waiting until the opportunity of midcourse correction 6, about 7 feet per second would be required. We do not plan to awaken the crew, at least immediately. Let them continue sleeping. All spacecraft systems continue to look very good to us from the ground. We've completed the change of shift here in mission control.

Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth has elected to perform the midcourse correction maneuver scheduled at transearth injection plus 15 hours. That would be at about 150 hours 25 minutes ground elapsed time. The exact time of that midcourse correction is not critical and it could move around somewhat.

Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only 4 nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All-Star basball game in Washington. After the game he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy Communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency Tass reported that "scientific research in near-moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. G.I.'s on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces Network radio and TV network in Vietnam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Isreali's along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All-Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night, in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and says he will play in the All-Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts.

I got two barber's poles indicating that the three capture latches, er, not capture latches, but the three gizmotches had made and we were soft docked; and at that time the situation looked very stable so I went to CMC's free, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time a gyration began between the two vehicles due - I am not sure to what, perhaps the LM dropping or perhaps it was building up prior and I had not noticed it. But anyway, during the retract of the probe, there were yaw-my-yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees and I had to come back on take the free switch and throw it back to auto and try to damp them out and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I will let him tell you about his side of it. And I thought that we were

not going to get a successful retraction and hard dock. However, in about I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I could see the situation damping out and we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband holds and at contact I thrusted plus X and shortly after that we had sizeable attitude oscillation and thruster bearing so we opened up the deadband to max and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went off after (garble) retraction.

This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 58 minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the crew a few minutes ago was for the midcourse correction number 5. That is scheduled to occur 150 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds. It will be a Reaction Control System burn using the spacecraft reaction control system thrusters. With a velocity change of 4.8 feet per second, and that will be retrograde. Primary purpose of the maneuver will be to adjust the entry conditions which is - would primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a ground elapse time of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured from lunar orbit insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that - before the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and the moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both bodies. And we would define this as the equal potential point. That will occur at 155 hours 30 minutes. And at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth, 52,543 nautical miles from the moon. We're now 1 hour 28 minutes 26 seconds from ignition for the midcourse correction 5 maneuver.

I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. It was when we were in orbit and had - after we took our helmets off.

CAPCOM
Roger, did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called us?

SC
It just might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.

CAPCOM
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by your erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.

SC
Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motion the PCO2 gage.

CAPCOM
Roger. What was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister - that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.

SC
I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy. Was there any change in your suit loop count? Go ahead.

SC
I should mention Bruce that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary. I didn't notice any change, but about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes the water stopped coming out. So, maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.

CAPCOM
Roger, did you make any changes in, the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion - that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the divertor valve position to egress any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.

SC
No, I don't believe we did that at all Bruce.

CAPCOM
Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.

Go ahead.

Go ahead, Houston.

CAPCOM
Roger. For 64,000 dollars we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM2 Chart at Julia .5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts onboard? Over.

SC
Stand by one. They're packed.

CAPCOM
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of west crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent lunar state or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing we're wondering about is that if you were at this position you would have seen the Cat's Paw during the ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.

SC
We were looking for the Cat's Paw too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big Z. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.

SC
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 millimeter film was working at that point in descent and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters and crater rows and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.

CAPCOM
Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.

SC
It was mostly white - perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it, and it seemed to be, as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter of the Earth's radii. Over.

CAPCOM
Roger, Buzz; we copy.

SC
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.

SC
And I saw that too. It was a very bright - spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.

CAPCOM
Okay, 11, very good. Now with respect to the documented sample container on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being - given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves, and we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.

SC
Yes, you remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks off the surface and several that were just subsurface, and about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM and then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on and several beyond that and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.

CAPCOM
Mike, over here on page 9-7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not mark a VERB 16 NOUN 20. It turns out that the significance of that is that if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20 then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24 you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24 and NOUN 01 ENTER before you load the three registers.

Okay, that's enough of the moon Charlie. We're getting set up for some inside pictures.

CAPCOM
Right.

SC
We've got a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed and then brought inside the LM and then put inside these fiberglass bags zippered and resealed around the outside and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes and as soon as we get onto the ship I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the lunar receiving laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock. The ground mass is the soil, the sand and silt and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.

CAPCOM
Roger Neil thank you much for that description. We've got a pretty dark picture down here could you set your F-stop. We'd like to have it, see if you can open it up a little bit, over.

Okay our moniter showed that to be very bright.

food department. I'm sure you've already seen the drink container. A little later Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out hydrogen. Essentially this water gun is put in this hand and filled up this bag with water and the tang then disolves in the water and this end of the - out feeding. Likewise we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can probably see this shrimp cocktail meal. This afternocn while the two of us had salmon salad. Another early development was the use of bite size food.

CAPCOM
Eleven, Houston, Buzz, you're breaking up badly, will you check your vox, over.

SC
Roger, how am I coming through now, Charlie.

CAPCOM
You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your vox is not keying at every word, over.

SC
Okay.

SC
These bite size objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin so they designed a particular size that would be able to go all into the mouth at once. I think since all of our experience we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back to some of the type meals that we have on earth. As a matter of fact on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread and along with the bread we have a ham spread, and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham - while I'm in zero "G". I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to - - you're all very familiar with.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 so we'll be loosing a high gain shortly, over.

SC
You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. We know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, I'll do this by pushing my hand against it in this fashion once its spinning, by the equations we can predict, if as I put this torque on it, it will in fact -


END OF TAPE


APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-22-69     CDT 20:20  -  GET 155:47  -  TAPE 488/1

SC
and begins to in this fashion onceits spinning. By the equations, we can predict that if I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out. See even if I apply the torque this way, its rotated this way.

SC
Too close isn't it?

CAPCOM
11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.

SC
Houston this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon kids?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative 11.

SC
Okay, well as I said, I was going to tell you but I'm afraid I filled it too far and its going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and give me the water and start all over again. Okay?

CAPCOM
Okay.

SC
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another and that really is water, I tell you.

SC
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you. Here's the water gun, this cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes. One allows water to pass but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass but not any water so by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through the filter we're able to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And of course all we do to get it started is pull the trigger. It's sort of massy. I haven't been at this very long. It's the same system that the Spaniards used to drink at a winestand at the bull fights, only I think it'd be more fun.

SC
We'll be seeing you kid.

CAPCOM
Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the earth from the moon.

Now in the passive thermal control mode, or barbecue mode, Charlie Duke is going to make another call to the crew. Let's listen in, in a moment. He's discussing with Flight Director Deke Frank, who tonight is spelling Gene Kranz on this shift, although Gene is here. They're discussing some adjustments to the passive thermal control mode. Apollo 11 has left the moon some 53,666 miles behind it. And relative to the moon, Apollo 11 is traveling now at 4306 feet per second. Continue to monitor air to ground here till the crew settles down. They're not scheduled to go into their rest period until about another 4 hours from now.

PAO
This is Delta Launch Control. We have postponed the launch of the Delta vehicle tonight. The launch of INTELSAT 3, 24 hours. The reason for this postponement is to examine the second stage propellant ground equipment. There is a slight chance that the acid used in the second stage for an oxidizer inhibited red fuming nitric acid, could have contained an excessive level of contaminants. This possibility is the most that there is a desire to make the examination. During fueling today, it was noticed that the transfer of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid took longer than expected, or longer than normal. In examining the ground equipment, it was found that a filter element had dislodged and had traveled approximately 2 feet into the line. There is need now to insure, that in fact, the displacement of this filter was what caused the slowdown and also a need now to analyze the IRFNA, or inhibited red fuming nitric acid to insure that no contamination is evident. The launch has been rescheduled for 24 hours from now, or 24 hours from 10:00 PM tonight. This has been cleared with the range. We have the same launch window tomorrow night. 10:00 PM to 11:10 PM. This is Delta Launch Control.

How's the weather down there? You got any rain?

CAPCOM
Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, and it's been overcast. A slow storm system has been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.

SC
Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California which is a little bit unusual.

CAPCOM
Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have cleared up outside now according to some of the people coming in. It's a constant overcast. The marker here is a little hard to see outside.

It's apparently raining fairly hard up in Washington where the all-star game was to be played tonight. They started out on it and then it was rained out, and they called it off.

Let's see, right now the mid, yes, the MPL - we've got 3 clouds of scattered, visibility, 10, waves at 3 feet at the present water. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - Flight just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast. There are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and vicinity. There's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. Looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery. Navy called up those special COMM C's for you guys from up there on the Hudson.

SC
Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess. We ought to be given a pretty close eye.

SC
AUTO it is.

SC
Houston, Apollo 11.

SC
What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our storage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back in the command module and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM in Compartment Able-8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A-8 into stoop bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old photographing and also old underwear and helmet protective advisors from the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.

Apollo 11, Houston, based on our sighting since the midcourse we're showing a gama of -6.57. This is preliminary though and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, we could tweak it right on to the quarter. It's just about in the center of quarter, everything's looking fine. We'll have you a entry pad in a couple of hours before you go to sleep, and from our friends in public affairs a few headlines, other than your flight. Your still dominating the news, however there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the all star game was rained out, it's going to be played tomorrow, however President Nixon will not be able to see it as he had planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And also the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forcast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area, it should be real fine out there. President Nixon as he prepares to fly out to greet your return says that within 31 years man will have visited at least 1 other planet having some form of life. In the year 2 thousand we, on this earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life, he told 2 thousand foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip the president sent congress his proposal for reorganizing the interstate commerce commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelsat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 PM Eastern Daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system shows some contamination. And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And also today NASA announced that it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn 5. And your television pictures attracted a lot of interest.

This is Apollo Control, 158 hours, 1 minute ground elapsed time. There's been a certain amount of conversation between Charlie Duke here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. We'll play back the accumulated tape at this time and then rejoin the conversation when it does resume on a live basis. Let's roll the tape now.

CAPCOM
Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz you brought the surgeon out of his chair. We see you exercising. Over.

SC
Thank you.

CAPCOM
Exercising. Is that correct Buzz?

SC
Yes Buzz is.

CAPCOM
Roger. We've got his heartbeat way up.

SC
(Garble) I have seen.

CAPCOM
Yes. That's what we thought.

SC
Right - you sure got a busy one tonight, huh Char?

CAPCOM
Say again Mike. Over.

SC
I said the white team really got a busy one today, huh?

CAPCOM
Oh boy. We're really moving along here with all this activity. Can barely believe it.

SC
What are you doing? Sitting there with your feet up on the console doing drawing?

CAPCOM
You must have your x-ray eyes up. You still can see a long way.

SC
We're watching you as well, you know.

CAPCOM
Your right.

SC
You people in the viewing room and the boys in the trench.

CAPCOM
We've got 8 in the viewing room and let's see, about 6 in the trench right now. And this is the highlight of the day, Buzz's exerecise for the surgeon. 11 you copy. Over.

SC
Roger 11.

CAPCOM
Neil has the highest heartbeat ever seen on a manned spaceflight. We just went low bid rate. The surgeon is about to die.

SC
I measured it up here to be 247.

CAPCOM
Boy, that's super.

SC
The units on that furlong per fortnight.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy that. EECOM says if you keep that up, you're going to have to change your CO2 canisters.

SC
You were going to make me do that in another 45 minutes anyway.

CAPCOM
That's true.

SC
That's why I waited until Monday, I was really looking forward to that.

CAPCOM
Thank you 11. We appreciate you turning that off.

SC
Charlie, could you copy our music down there?

CAPCOM
Did we copy what, Neil?

SC
Did you copy our music down there?

CAPCOM
Roger. We sure did. We're wondering who selected - made your selection?

SC
That's an old favorite of mine. It's an album made about 20 years ago, called Music out of the Moon.

CAPCOM
Roger. It sounded a little scratchey to us, Neil. Either that or you're tape was a little slow.

SC
It's suppose to sound that way.

SC
It sounds a little scratchey to us too, but the czar likes it.

CAPCOM
That's what we figured, he and his 40,000 votes.

SC
Well, the answer we got looks like about 150,000 out now.

SC
It's getting appreciably larger now. It's getting more like the world.

CAPCOM
Roger. I'm looking at the right side of the screen this time.

SC
How's everything going on the - say again, Charlie?

CAPCOM
Roger. I'll never hear the last about that Earth, Moon business on the TV there and I was just saying that I was looking at the right side of the board here so your going towards the earth. What were you going to say Mike?

SC
You'll have a lot of fun at the press conference after this shift, then, won't you?

CAPCOM
It's 2:30, everybody will be asleep. I going to sneak off through the back way.

SC
I was just wondering how everything is going at the homefront. Are all our kids in one piece.

CAPCOM
Roger. Sure are. Everything doing fine. All the gals are having a little party tonight as far as I know.

SC
Roger. Glad to hear it.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about the earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into Verb 24 and did the two ENTERS, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.

SC
Yeah, I'm all ears.

CAPCOM
Okay, I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97 and we could walk you through it and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.

SC
Okay, I got it.

CAPCOM
Okay, Mike, what happened is, you know, you were sitting there monitoring Verb 16, Noun 20 and at step 7 you went into Verb 24, Noun 01 and keyed in the EGRESS and then information information and on the final enter of that 35400 enter, right after that, that did put you back into the 16, Noun 20. Then when you did the Verb 24 ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU's, and when you got the two entries in in register 1 and 2, it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU's, and the CMDAC looked at that and saw what it thought it had - My gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate, and it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out, and the rate filters that it's looking at - well, the rate is looking at its filters, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up and then it starts reading the rate filters and it says - well, I really didn't have 600 degrees, so then it turns it off and tries to slow it down, but until that happens, and it is some time lag and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second range. Over.

SC
Okay, I got you.

CAPCOM
Roger.

SC
Man.

SC
Hey, Charlie, you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded Noun 20 with some value other than what's being read by the CDU's?

CAPCOM
I think I got, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second Verb 24 the noun was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it and the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU's. Stand by on your comments. We' re switching antennas.

SC
Okay.

SC
Alright.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that Buzz? Over.

SC
Yeah, I think so. I - I thought that noun 20 was one of those that you can never load from the DSKY and

APOLLO 11 MISSION COMMENTARY    7-22-69     CDT 22:43  -  GET 158:11  -  TAPE 495/2

SC
and that still may be. Maybe you would load it just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the gimbal angles, then they changed it back to what they actually are, but in the meantime, the DAP is different numbers. Is that right?

CAPCOM
Well, I got it. Guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDUs, the actual CDUs, but we're checking on that. Over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the noun 20, but you should not.

SC
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

CAPCOM
You' re welcome.

SC
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, we'd like - the span guys say it look - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.

SC
I doubt if it will fit on that one in B1. The other one might - might go into sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags. and the LM EVVA's in the LM EVVA bags.

SC
I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay filled up. It won't hack, Charlie, with a cover. I tried it already.

CAPCOM
Okay. Fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd let you check it out. Sounds like you've already done that so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.

Okay, Buzz. On your flight plan items a few updates first of all. We have cancelled the midcourse No. 6. Just remain in PTC. I'll give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the flight plan is we're ready for a Bat B charge anytime you want to put it on the line and third item we'd like a waste water dump a little differently this time. We'd like to do it on our marks on the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged and we'd like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration

The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from earth satellites you were taking yesterday afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical conversion zone which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola. Further to the west its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm, Viola, has been intensifying and should be transfered to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so, however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to take some pictures and comment on it when you get a change to see Viola in a few hours.

Okay, go ahead.

CAPCOM
Oke doak. Hot off the press here, we find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designates after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the national movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain. House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities. House could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loans institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way. Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway linking toll with the Port of Ingchong has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit the 7 nations including Rumania during this trip. As I think you also knew, had to miss the All-Star Baseball game yesterday as it was rained out, but it is being played today. The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, British Columbia, San Francisco, all plan to make their areas visible to the 3 of you by lighting their lights between 9 p.m. and midnight according to the associated press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see the Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on. A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea," said Mrs. McGhee, "it was my husbands." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they compromised on just Module. Over.

So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.

Thank you very much, Owen. I think maybe ya'll could use some water.

Okay, I guess there's been worse.

Houston, Apollo 11. It was rightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOM notice any change in data or any explanation for that?

Roger, stand by just a moment. We're going to check some temperatures.

SC
Up until last night it was - if anything on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.

CAPCOM
Roger, then we'll run down the temperature for the two nights.

Oh, it's no big thing. Just a matter of interest.

And how did you like the Command Module RCS temperatures?

CAPCOM
11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.

We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going to be required by a country mile.

SC
The peculiar thing, Owen, now on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking, I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DPC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle difference is - seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.

CAPCOM
Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.

SC
Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.

SC
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I thought, well, the heck, I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway, and I got 5 zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on I have consistently been getting .01.

CAPCOM
Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.

SC
I usually do. The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's I would say even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient, so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and keep - it sweeps within the capability of the sextant field of view.

CAPCOM
Understand, Mike.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, those look like the spacecraft may have cooled down about 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level. Over.

SC
Okay. Is that a LM off phenomenon?

CAPCOM
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of lunar orbit, so we don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can get a better answer.

SC
Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.

CAPCOM
Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

SC
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 11.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler inside the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amount of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.

SC
That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem that though between the dirt and all, we've had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel - correction - the LM hadn't been opened yet and we were translunar.

CAPCOM
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.

SC
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time, but subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any build-up in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft for example, the windows are not fogging, and various other cool spots of the spacecraft, all then appear to be completely dry.

Reentry is scheduled to begin based on no further midcourse corrections at 195 hours 3 minutes 5 seconds. At this time, it appears that midcourse correction 7, if it were done, would only require 0.2 of a foot per second, and based on current tracking, we wouldn't expect to have to midcourse correction 7, although the tracking will be continued and a decision on midcourse correction 7 will not be made - until closer to the time of the maneuver.

Eleven, this is Houston. We're receiving a light signal from you right now but we are getting TV, over.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. The network controller now reports that the TV signal is down. Apparently having been turned off and we suspect that what we have is a test of the system by the crew. The television transmission from the spacecraft is scheduled to begin at 177 hours 30 minutes or about 2 minutes past 6, Central Daylight time. At the present time Apollo 11 is 93 thousand 2 hundred 18 nautical miles from the earth.

ARMSTRONG
Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Vernes wrote a book about a voyage to the moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean, after completeing a trip to the moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.

ARMSTRONG
We'll be right back with you.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.

ARMSTRONG
We're glad to hear that.

CAPCOM
Okay 11, you're back on with Mike in the middle of the screen there.

COLLINS
Roger. This trip of ours to the moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to say that it has not been a game. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery. Every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary. Each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone. There is one single switch designed. In addition to that, there are myriad of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the AFT end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow, or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First the American workmen, who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is

somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface, are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say thank you very much.

CAPCOM
11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modilation. And would you open up the F-stop on the TV camera, try 22, please? That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.

ALDRIN
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. But we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft. We've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than 3 men on a voyage to the moon. More still than the efforts of a government and industry team. More even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon, "this is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the moon. The acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight. Depicting the US eagle, bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth, from the planet earth to the moon, that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon. Personally, in reflecting the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."

ARMSTRONG
The responsibility for this flight lies first, with history.

ARMSTRONG
The responsibility for the flight lies first with, history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort. Next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire. Next to four administrations, and their congresses, for implementing that will, and then to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and back pack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their, their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God Bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.

Houston, Apollo 11, do you want to crank that PTC again, do you have some reason to hold its attitude or what's your pleasure.

And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh - magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings. F 11 at 1/250th frames per second. Focus on 7 feet for the fireball. F 2.0 1/60th of a second. 6 frames per second. Focus on 50 feet when the chute's opened. If you are using a magazine part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend F 16 at 1/500th of a second. 6 frames per second. Focus on 7 feet for the fireball. F 2.8 1/60th of a second. 6 frames per second. Focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open, and we would like to know the magazine number if you are intending to use if you have a chance, over.

Okay, I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be - color interior, over.

CAPCOM
Roger. When you get - get it out we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.

Okay, and we're thinking that we might want to run some of this at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from point size of - point 0 size B down that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and (garbled) double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it six.

CAPCOM
This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us Neil.

SC
Okay.

And lastly, we would like to know if your storage configuration for entry is going to conform to the nominal. The retros down here are acted to get accurate CG computed for you and in particular where the EVVAS are being stowed, over.

SC
Okay.

CAPCOM
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got on the helmet bag, correction hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint on the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bags traps are only - configured for zero "G" and it is a pretty difficult job getting it latched down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard latch down procedure and you could also use the Betta cord that you have onboard. You concurr, over.

Yeah, we'll look at it Charlie, and let you know.

CAPCOM
Roger, and I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time and also the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange, correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control.

Because of forecast thunderstorms in the prime recovery area in the midpacific for tomorrow the Apollo Spacecrafts lifting capabilities will be used to stretch the entry path some 215 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a new landing point, aiming point with the very rough preliminary coordinates of 13 degrees 19 minutes north by 169 degrees 10 minutes west. These numbers will be refined through the night as retrofire officer exercises the computer and comes up with more definitive numbers. These will be passed on as they are available. Apollo 11 now 75 thousand 9 hundred 51 nautical miles out from earth approaching at 6 thousand 8 hundred 99 feet per second. At 181 hours 50 minutes and standing by on the air ground circuit this is Apollo Control.

CAPCOM
Apollo 11, Houston, some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet, it turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet so just set it at infinity, over.

This is Apollo Control. All good nights having been said, the crew of Apollo 11 is now preparing to get their 10 hours rest and their last night in space. Here in the Control Center one of the 10 by 10 Eidophor television projectors - a drawing has been projected on the screen ribbing Capcom Charlie Duke for his slight error yesterday on the television pass where he mistook the moon for Earth. It has the spacecraft midway between the moon and Earth and it says, "Neil, I just spotted a continent on the moon. Charlie, the camera's on Earth now." Apollo 11 now 74,906 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6954 feet per second. And at 182 hours, 6 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.

Crew now in their rest period. Started their sleep period a little over an hour ago. To reiterate the change in landing point, this is a weather avoidance situation where thunder storms are forecast for the landing point - the original landing point in the Pacific, therefore, after the normal entry interface the lifting characteristics of the Apollo Command Module will be used to extend entry range some 250 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a preliminary aiming point, that is the aiming point may shift around between now and entry which is some 11 hours, 36 minutes from now. But at any rate the aiming point as calculated now is some 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, by 169 degrees 10 minutes west longitude. The preliminary time of drogue decline is 195 hours, 12 minutes. As you were - yes 195 hours, I2 minutes, 4 seconds.

Houston, Apollo 11. I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.

CAPCOM
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant G, and what we're trying to do is extend the constant G range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulators and it works fine. The best way to go through it, just go through it and if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector UP until MAX G, and then lift vector DOWN and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay, this procedure is essentially the same so far, and then hold g dot zero until you pass the retro elapsed time of V circular and then after you pass this retro elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you've come to the retro elapsed time of drogues.

SPEAKER
President Nixon waving to the astronauts. The curtains have been drawn. There they are in the rear window. President is receiving applause from the crowd. Astronauts gather in the window.

NIXON
Neil, Buzz, and Mike. I want you to know that I think I'm luckiest man in the world. And I say this not only because I have the honor to be President of the United States, but particularly because I have the privilege of speaking for so many in welcoming you back to earth. I could tell you about all the messages we received in Washington. Over one hundred foreign governments, Emperors, and Presidents and Prime Ministers and Kings have sent the most warm messages that we have ever received. They represent over 2 billion people on this earth. All of them who have had the opportunity through television to see what you have done. And then I also bring you messages from members of the Cabinet and members of the Senate and members of the House and Space Agency. And in the streets of San Francisco where people stopped me a few days ago, and you all love that city, I know, as I do. But most important, I had a telephone call yesterday. The toll wasn't, incidentally, as great as the one I made to you fellows on the moon. (Laughter) I made that collect, just in case you didn't know. But I called the three of, in my view, three of the greatest ladies and most courageous ladies in the whole world today, your wives. And from Jan and Joan and Pat, I bring their love and their congratulations. We think that it is just wonderful that they could have participated at least through television in this return; we're only sorry they couldn't be here. And also, I've got to let you in on a little secret - I made a date with them. (Laughter) I invited them to dinner on the thirteenth of August, right after you come out of quarantine. It will be a State dinner held in Los Angeles. The governors of all the 50 States will be there, the ambassadors, others from around the world and in America. And they told me that you would come too. And all I want to know - will you come? We want to honor you then.

ARMSTRONG
We'll do anything you say, Mr. President. Just anything.

NIXON
One question, I think, all of us would like to ask. As we say you bouncing around in that boat out there, I wonder if that wasn't the hardest part of the journey. Was that - did any of you get seasick?

ARMSTRONG
No, we didn't. And it was one of the harder parts, but it was one of the most pleasant, we can assure you.

NIXON
Yes, well, I just know that you can sense what we all sense. When you get back now - incidentally,

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, 7-24-69     TAPE 581/2

have you been able to follow some of the things that happen when you've gone. Did you know about the All-Star game?

ARMSTRONG
Yes, sir. The Capsule Communicators have been giving us daily news stories.

COLLINS
They daily post us.

NIXON
Were you American League or National League?

ARMSTRONG
I'm National League man.

ALDRIN
I'm nonpartisan, sir.

COLLINS
That's right.

NIXON
There's the politician in the group, right.

ARMSTRONG
We're sorry you missed that game.

NIXON
Yes, well - you knew that too.

ARMSTRONG
We hear that -

NIXON
The rain -

ARMSTRONG
The rain. Well, we haven't been able to control the weather yet, but that's something we can look forward to as tomorrow's challenge.

NIXON
Right, right. Well, I can only summarize it because I don't want to hold you now. You have so much more to do. And gee, you look great; do you feel as good as you look?

ARMSTRONG
Oh, we feel just perfectly, Mr. President.

NIXON
Yeah, I understand your - Frank Borman says you're a little younger by reason of having gone into space, is that right. Do you feel that way, a little younger?

COLLINS
We're a lot younger than Frank Borman. (Laughter).

NIXON
There he is, over there. Come on over Frank so they can see you. You going to take that lying down?

ALDRIN
It looks like he has aged in the last couple of days.

NIXON
Come on Frank.

BORMAN
Mr. President, the one thing I wanted. You know we have a poet in Mike Collins and he really gave me a hard time for describing new words of fantastic and beautiful. And you - and counted them, in three minutes up there you used four fantastics and two beautifuls. (Laughter).

NIXON
Well, just let me close off with this one thing. I was thinking as you know, as you came down and we knew it was a success, and it had only been eight days, just a week, a long week. But this is the greatest week in the history of the world since the creation. Because as a result of what happened in this week, the world is bigger infinitely, and also as I'm going to find on this trip around the world and as Secretary Rogers will find as he covers the other countries and Asia. As a result of what you've done the world's never been closer together before. And we just thank you for that. And I only hope that all of us in government,

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, 7-24-69     TAPE 581/3

all of us in America that as a result of what you've done, we can do our job a little better. We can reach for the stars just as you have reached so far for the stars. We don't want to hold you any longer. Anybody have a last re- How about promotions, do you think we could arrange something? (Laughter)

ARMSTRONG
We're just pleased to be back and very honored that you were so kind as to come out here and welcome us back, and we look forward to getting out of this quarantine -

COLLINS
Great.

ARMSTRONG
- and talking without having glass between us.

NIXON
And incidently, the speeches that you have to make at this dinner can be very short. And if you want to say fantastic or beautiful, that's all right with us. Don't try to think of any new adjectives; they've all been said. And now, I think incidently, that all of us who - the millions that are seeing us on television now, are seeing you, would feel as I do that in a sense our prayers have been answered, and I think it would be very appropriate if Chaplain Pierto, the Chaplain of this ship were to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. If he would step up now. Chaplain, thank you.

CHAPLAIN
Let us pray. Lord, God, our Heavenly Father. Our minds are staggered and our spirit exalted with the magnitude and precision of this entire Apollo 11 mission. We have spent the past week in communal anxiety and hope as our astronauts sped through the glories and dangers of the heavens. As we try to understand and analyze the scope of this achievement for human life, our reason is overwhelmed with abounding gratitude and joy, even as we realize the increasing challenges of the future. This magnificent event illustrates a new what man can accomplish when purpose is firm and intent corporate. A man on the moon was promised in this decade. And though, some were unconvinced, the reality is with us this morning, in the persons of Astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. We applaud their splended exploits and we pour out our thanksgiving for their safe return to us, to their families, to all mankind. From our inmost beings, we sing humble, yet exhuberant praise. May the great effort, and commitment seen in this project, Apollo, inspire our lives to move similiarly in other areas of need. May we the people by our enthusiasm and devotion and insight move to new landings in brotherhood, human concern, and mutual respect. May our country, afire with inventive leadership and backed by a committed followership, blaze new trails into all areas of human cares. See our enthusiasm and bless our joy with dedicated purpose for the many needs at hand. Link us in friendship with peoples throughout the world as we strive together to better the human condition. Grant us peace beginning

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, 7-24-69     TAPE 581/4

in our own hearts. And a mind atuned with good will toward our neighbor. All this we pray as our thanksgiving rings out to thee. In the name of our Lord, amen.

COLLINS
Amen.
