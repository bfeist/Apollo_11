000:28:53|LMP|How are we doing on that time, anybody? Neil, are you sort of master of ceremonies on time, yet?
000:29:00|CDR|Well, I didn't ...
000:29:22|LMP|(Singing) Okay, your DRINKING WATER SUPPLY valve is ON.
000:29:27|CMP|How about this ... circuit configuration? GLYCOL RESERVOIR BYPASS valve OPEN?
000:29:33|CDR|(Cough) ... BYPASS is OPEN.
000:29:38|CMP|RESERVOIR OUT valve CLOSED?
000:29:40|CDR|OUT's CLOSED.
000:29:41|CMP|IN valve CLOSED?
000:29:42|CDR|IN's CLOSED.
000:29:43|CMP|ECS RADIATOR FLOW CONTROL, PRIMARY.
000:29:48|LMP|...
000:29:51|CMP|Hey, Buzz?
000:29:52|LMP|Yes.
000:29:53|CMP|How would you like the camera?
000:29:55|LMP|Okay.
000:29:56|CMP|PRIMARY GLYCOL TO RADIATOR valve, NORMAL.
000:29:59|LMP|Why don't I leave the dark slide - -
000:30:01|CDR|Are we ready for that, you think? What's the time?
000:30:04|LMP|30 minutes. ...
000:30:08|CDR|... to NORMAL, and check the radiator.
000:30:13|CMP|It will take awhile, that's - -
000:30:16|LMP|Okay, now, is that normal for the discharge pressure to zap down low and to do that? Do you think, Mike?
000:30:23|CMP|What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
000:30:25|LMP|When Neil sends the GLYCOL RADIATORS to NORMAL, temporarily, it - -
000:30:31|CDR|It drops?
000:30:33|LMP|Yes.
000:30:34|CMP|The temperature done that?
000:30:35|CDR|LMP
000:30:36|CMP|Yes, pressure - you might get a little drop in it, I don't really know, but it came back up.
000:30:38|LMP|Yes, it goes back up.
000:30:39|CMP|Alright, Buzz, here's one Hasselblad for you.
000:30:40|CDR|Coming around the right-hand couch.
000:30:42|LMP|That seems okay.
000:30:44|CMP|Buzz?
000:30:45|LMP|Yes, just a second.
000:30:47|CMP|Okay. I'll just let go of it, Buzz; it will be hanging over here in the air. Coming up - it's occupying my couch.
000:31:03|LMP|Okay.
000:31:05|CMP|Just leave the dark slide with it?
000:31:08|LMP|Well, I thought about ... the dark slide or something, and then I thought we might need it later for a magazine change; so, I left it with it.
000:31:25|CMP|Well, I know there's an orange dot on this ... somewhere.
000:32:05|LMP|That looks just a couple of degrees still above the -
000:32:19|CMP|Buzz, did you ever get that camera?
000:32:21|LMP|Yes.
000:32:23|CMP|Okay.
000:32:44|CDR|Now, look.
000:32:46|CMP|Yes, I guess it's 5 minutes after you do this before ...
000:32:55|LMP|It's coming down, but it's - -
000:32:56|CDR|Is it?
000:32:57|LMP|- - as I said before, that's -
000:33:06|CDR|It looks like that's about equal to the limit pressure.
000:33:07|CMP|Yes, they're about - they're just about the same now.
000:33:11|CDR|Not getting much out of the radiator.
000:33:18|CMP|Okay, Buzz, are you ready for 16 millimeter?
000:33:20|LMP|Yes. How about a bracket?
000:33:22|CMP|Let - Neil will give you the bracket.
000:33:40|CDR|And the bracket - bracket slide -
000:33:47|CMP|Okay, Buzz, I'm going to have to do something about your couch. You mind sliding over to mine?
000:33:52|LMP|No, that's fine.
000:33:54|CMP|Could you - -
000:33:55|LMP|Can you work on that strap?
000:33:56|CMP|Oh, yes, I will. Sure will. The - the one that your strut's off ... instrument panel.
000:34:01|LMP|Yes. ...
000:34:54|CMP|And your ...
000:35:09|CDR|That temperature's coming down a little bit now.
000:35:14|LMP|Yes.
000:35:41|LMP|Now, let's see. You got an 18 millimeter on here, right?
000:35:44|CMP|Yes.
000:35:46|LMP|So - Do I push the thing all the way up? Is that right?
000:35:50|CMP|Yes.
000:35:51|LMP|About with that white mark?
000:35:52|CMP|Yes, one's for the 18, and one's for the 75; I – I think just as long it looks like it's out and ... the window, that's the main thing.
000:36:40|CDR|Did you get a secondary radiator leak check?
000:36:43|LMP|Yes, we did that.
000:36:44|CDR|Okay. We're not hearing them, but we're ... Tananarive.
000:36:48|CMP|Are we on SIMPLEX A?
000:36:49|CDR|We're on SIMPLEX A.
000:36:51|LMP|We're on SIMPLEX A, but we're not due over Tananarive for another couple of seconds.
000:36:56|CDR|Okay.
000:36:58|CMP|What - ... time is 36 something - -
000:37:00|LMP|Am I set up on VHF? Can you tell ...?
000:37:11|CMP|Yes, just a second. Just a second - Your MASTER is ON; your INTERCOM is ON; your VHF is ON; your PAD COMM is OFF; your S-BAND is ON; and you're in INTERCOM/PUSH-TO-TALK, so you're all squared away, except for maybe VOLUME dial.
000:37:29|LMP|Okay.
000:37:31|CDR|Now, Buzz, this item here at Canaries. LOS, 23:36; POTABLE WATER HEATER, MAIN A - -
000:37:38|LMP|Yes, I got that.
000:37:39|CDR|- - PCM BIT RATE, LOW - -
000:37:40|LMP|I got that.
000:37:41|CDR|- - You got all that, okay. Okay, when was the - -
000:37:44|LMP|And the purge check's complete, and I'm working my way down to ECS.
000:37:50|CDR|Okay.
000:37:51|CMP|I'm having a hell of a time maintaining my body position down here; I keep floating up.
000:37:56|LMP|Well, there's such a great tendency to - to try and put a little force ... want to stay there. Just forget about all that and go wherever you want.
000:38:11|CDR|Okay, I got the SYSTEMS TEST meter set up on 4-B and ... attitude ...
000:38:18|LMP|4-B, okay.
000:38:19|CMP|What are you reading?
000:38:20|CDR|I'm reading 3.50.
000:38:26|LMP|... our attitude quantities ...
000:38:36|CC|Houston, Apollo 11.
000:38:41|CDR|Hello, Houston; Apollo ll.
000:38:46|CMP|OPTICS ZERO is OFF. I'm going to jettison the ... cover - -
000:38:50|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11; this is Houston through Tananarive. Over.
000:38:56|CDR|Hello, Houston; Apollo 11. Go ahead.
000:39:03|LMP|Houston. Apollo 11, read you on VHF A SIMPLEX. How do you read? Over.
000:39:09|CC|Roger, 11; this is Houston. We're reading you loud and fairly clearly. For your information, Tananarive radar shows you in a 103.0 by 103.0 orbit. Over.
000:39:24|LMP|Beautiful.
000:39:26|CC|We concur.
000:39:30|CDR|Well, we're just coming into the terminator, here.
000:39:40|CMP|I jettisoned the optics; I hope they went. Did you see them go?
000:39:44|LMP|I heard a little something, but I - -
000:39:47|CMP|Don't want to miss that.
000:39:48|LMP|No.
000:39:55|CMP|Can't really tell here. I think I'm seeing the horizon - out there, but I'm ... far from being dark-adapted; it's hard to tell -
000:40:08|LMP|... a double blind on this?
000:40:12|CMP|Yes. What were those Z-30 angles? 0.22, isn't it?
000:40:18|LMP|That's right, plus.
000:40:19|CMP|Sure's a big one, isn't it? Okay, well, I'm standing by to do this - -
000:40:28|LMP|Got A and B down.
000:40:32|CMP|- - IMU align. Unstow the optics handles. Anybody wants any of that claptrap out of R-1, now is the time to say it.
000:40:47|LMP|Give me that little circular Job.
000:40:52|CMP|Alright, I'll - I'll look for it, Buzz. Let me get these - optics handles. I guess I really didn't mean what I said right when I said it a little while ... Oh, I knew there was something messed up.
000:41:09|LMP|You say you had about 3-point-something volts up there?
000:41:12|CMP|Yes. ... and on the ...
000:41:17|LMP|3.4?
000:41:19|CMP|3.45, something like that - -
000:41:20|LMP|Oh, that's - that's the minimum. 3.4, 4.1. And you can whip it over to 4-A, if - -
000:41:28|CMP|Okay, 4-A is 3.8. Okay.
000:41:38|LMP|No, 4-A.
000:41:41|CMP|4-A?
000:41:42|LMP|Yes.
000:41:43|CMP|And 3.8.
000:41:44|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. 1 minute to LOS Tananarive; AOS Carnarvon is at 52:15. Over.
000:41:53|CDR|Apollo 11, Roger.
000:41:56|LMP|52:15.
000:41:57|CDR|You want some of these lights down further, Mark - Mike?
000:42:04|CMP|Don't worry about it for the time being; I'm potting around with handholds right now, Neil. ...
000:42:13|LMP|That battery compartment pressure, Mike, it ought to be less that 1.5. However, it says NA until first vent.
000:42:21|CMP|Okay.
000:42:22|LMP|It's greater than 1.5; that vent - vent –
000:42:25|CMP|Well, we haven't even done it yet.
000:42:27|LMP|...
000:42:28|CMP|Yes.
000:43:13|CDR|Man, we are in the dark, now.
000:43:25|CMP|You got any reading off that REPRESS O2 to be greater than 8 ...
000:43:37|LMP|We got - No, not quite that much. That's that crazy gage.
000:43:48|CDR|Okay, can I have the ... now?
000:43:53|LMP|Yes, you got it. ... 50 degrees ...
000:44:06|CDR|... here is your acid test.
000:44:10|CMP|Okay, what did he say 52 -
000:44:11|CDR|52 ... percent, about.
000:44:15|CMP|As I say, I can't see ... Let me know if you want me to - come back ...
000:44:52|CMP|It's - Menkent.
000:44:58|LMP|... ball on that pad - it's maintaining about 39 degrees, Mike.
000:45:02|CMP|Yes, I noticed that. Before, it was maintaining less than that; it was abnormally low. I almost asked them about it during boost, and then I decided to heck with it. Damn, it'll be hard to see through these optics ... down a little bit. Okay, proceed to Menkent. There she goes - Menkent.
000:45:31|CMP|Menkent - God, what a star.
000:45:35|LMP|Nobody in their right - -
000:45:36|CMP|Menkent's good - -
000:45:37|LMP|- - nobody in their right mind would pick that one.
000:45:38|CMP|- - Menkent's a good star.
000:45:40|LMP|Hey, I sure wish you'd get out that - that star chart.
000:45:45|CDR|Can't see a thing, huh?
000:45:46|CMP|No. It's in the - -
000:45:48|CDR|Did you look in the telescope?
000:45:49|CMP|- - in the sextant. Yes, but I can't see it in the telescope; in the sextant - I can't.
000:45:53|CDR|Okay.
000:45:54|CMP|I believe it's at the angle we have to mark on it.
000:46:06|LMP|It's a little on the chilly side in the cabin. Would you like - -
000:46:08|CDR|Feels comfortable to me.
000:46:09|LMP|- - would you like it a little warmer, anybody?
000:46:10|CDR|I don't think so; I think it's a little on the - -
000:46:13|LMP|...
000:46:16|CDR|It sure doesn't look - sure doesn't feel like - Actually, it may be a little - it may be a little warm.
000:46:20|LMP|Well, my - my feet are a little chilly; see, it's 47. Okay, 37 is - -
000:46:26|CMP|No, that's - -
000:46:27|LMP|- - is Nunki. What?
000:46:30|CMP|Okay. Hey, Buzz?
000:46:31|LMP|What?
000:46:32|CMP|Did you write down any marks on 30 and on 37?
000:46:35|LMP|I was going to mark on 37, and that's Nunki; 30 and 37?
000:46:39|CMP|Yes, sir.
000:46:43|LMP|30 -
000:46:45|CDR|I can see some stars. Well, maybe I ...
000:46:53|CMP|Okay, again, looking through the telescope, I'm absolutely unable to tell if it's Nunki, but I have it in the sextant - so let's mark on it.
000:47:18|CMP|... you guys would appreciate doing this with old G&N men.
000:47:24|CDR|0.01.
000:47:26|CMP|0.01, alright. - Shoot, I forget, I think that's gray Gienah.
000:47:29|CDR|Cup of coffee around here later on when you get a little time.
000:47:34|LMP|You like that, Neil? You want us to record that star?
000:47:40|CMP|I got it, I got it; go ahead.
000:47:41|LMP|Let's see, what's tearing me up is we're going to ORB rate on this damn booster, and the rate is very evident.
000:47:48|CMP|Okay, Z torque is plus 0.152 instead of 150; I suppose that's close enough. Now then, you got those numbers written down, Buzz?
000:48:01|LMP|Copy.
000:48:02|CMP|Okay. Now I - I - If I remember right, I think you're just supposed to torque without further ado. We give them the time at which we torque. So, as soon as you got them written down, let me know and I'll proceed and you can mark the time.
000:48:13|LMP|I've got it.
000:48:14|CMP|Okay, here we go. Proceed - torque.
000:48:15|LMP|48:15.
000:48:18|CMP|Okay, now I - I'm going to verify with the third star, and let's see what that star's going to be. Star number 34 - -
000:48:34|LMP|Atria - -
000:48:35|CMP|- - is Atria. You might note that, Buzz, also. I think - -
000:48:39|LMP|34?
000:48:40|CMP|Yes, I think that's the third star; it'll say somewhere in that checklist. Proceed to Atria. Alright, if IMU is realigned, realign the GDC.
000:49:04|LMP|0.1 degree. Probably GDC's off a lot more than that.
000:49:12|CMP|Okay, and Atria is there in the sextant. Well, you know, it's not right in the middle of the sextant. Of course, I guess - I don't know what - Have you ever heard any rules on what constitutes a good third star check?
000:49:32|LMP|No, all you're really doing is seeing that you've got the right stars, it seems to me.
000:49:36|CMP|It's there, but it's not dab-smack in the middle of the sextant; it's off, I would guess - 0.02 or some crazy number like that. Alright, having done that, VERB 37, ENTER; ... ENTER, and I'm going OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL, and cranking up the floodlights down here.
000:50:04|CMP|God, I'll tell you, the visibility through that telescope is a big disappointment.
000:50:10|LMP|It's ...
000:50:13|CMP|Okay, Buzz, got all that good stuff?
000:50:20|CDR|GDC's realigned, okay -
000:50:27|CMP|Reticle brightness ... I don't know anything about that. ... Stow optics eyepieces, okay, that's in work.
000:50:35|CDR|And ... out there right now. ... , Buzz?
000:50:46|LMP|Neil, I haven't been looking out - My eyes aren't very well adapted.
000:50:52|CDR|You got your light on.
000:50:59|CMP|Yes, look at those bright ones down here.
000:51:09|LMP|Lightning! Is that lightning out your window?
000:51:12|CDR|No, I haven't seen any lightning.
000:51:15|LMP|Hell, that must be lightning. Either that or it's the ...
000:51:19|CMP|You know, no matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces - -
000:51:23|CDR|I just saw something. Maybe it is the ... They said that Borman's ... could see it; they couldn't hear it, but they could see it alright -
000:51:30|LMP|Yes.
000:51:35|CMP|No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right.
000:51:45|CMP|0.01, God damn it! Now that's enough to piss a body off.
000:51:51|CDR|... that time.
000:51:53|LMP|S-band noise.
000:51:57|CDR|We're about to get - 10 seconds until acquisition.
000:51:59|LMP|Okay.
000:52:02|CMP|Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.
000:52:09|CDR|You want me to take your checklist, Mike, and kind of skim through it?
000:52:16|CMP|It says here, coming up on Carnarvon LOS at - -
001:04:44|CMP|Let - let me tell them about the TV ...
001:04:47|CMP|Roger, Bruce. Thank you. We expect TV. We've got it all hooked up. We have not yet turned it on; we're ready to do that now.
001:05:02|CMP|Okay, you think we can do that?
001:05:04|LMP|That's fine with us.
001:05:05|CDR|This one here?
001:05:17|LMP|Tell them that we've got nothing to do here but recheck it here for the next 20 minutes or so.
001:05:26|LMP|Okay. I'm ready to turn the TV on. Play with it. ... flashlight ... hook it up ...
001:06:00|CDR|Want a - ...? Mike?
001:06:01|LMP|No.
001:06:04|CMP|Yes, I'd love one, Neil; thank you. I just stuck it in my pocket.
001:06:15|CMP|Can I give you the wrapping back?
001:06:18|CDR|(Laughing) Now that is a problem, trying to find - -
001:06:21|CMP|It's a gooey one. Gooey when the paper doesn't want to come off, but thanks anyway.
001:06:54|LMP|What was you doing? (Laughter)
001:06:57|CMP|I don't know ... I almost lost it. I figured I'd really go along with the ... and put some of that ointment on - so slick that I rubbed my ring off (laughter).
001:07:08|LMP|Is that right?
001:07:09|CMP|Yes.
001:07:18|CMP|Have we got any daylight? I can't see outside at all.
001:07:22|CDR|Nothing yet, ...
001:07:26|LMP|How are you going to rig that up, Michael?
001:07:29|CMP|Well, Buzz, I'm going to hold it out that hatch window.
001:07:30|LMP|Handhold it?
001:07:32|CMP|Yes - yes, yes, handhold it; don't dick with that.
001:07:38|CDR|Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor; have you run ...?
001:07:40|CMP|Yes.
001:08:09|CDR|Mike, how about this thing?
001:08:16|CMP|REPRESS - let's see, it's supposed to be - 865.
001:08:22|LMP|Go ahead.
001:08:23|CMP|And it - it kind of varies - not 865, but it's - 830.
001:08:33|CDR|...
001:08:40|CMP|Well, I don't know how - that ought to ...
001:08:44|CDR|I can turn - turn it on FILL for a minute, if you like. That's what we need to do, I think.
001:08:51|CMP|Maybe the ... this son of a bitch is working or not.
001:09:06|CDR|You got the power switches turned on up there at the - -
001:09:10|CMP|Yes. ...
001:09:21|LMP|Let's get into the Hasselblad ... get the right settings on it.
001:09:26|CMP|Okay.
001:09:29|LMP|Is Goldstone the only station that's going to get this?
001:09:32|CDR|Yes, that's all. That's the only one that's got a scanner converter. We've only got about 4 minutes, looks like.
001:09:44|LMP|That must be doing something.
001:09:46|CMP|Yes.
001:09:47|CDR|How long - -
001:09:48|CMP|You got it on infinity for one thing; let me put it down here.
001:09:52|CDR|- - how long is it supposed to take to - -
001:09:53|CMP|...?
001:09:54|CDR|No, no, it's the one with the ...
001:09:59|LMP|Okay, it's - it's working somewhat; it's just the question of not enough light in here when I get it.
001:10:06|CDR|Yes.
001:10:07|LMP|... It's, I think, working okay.
001:10:10|CDR|We ought to be coming out into the daylight here in a little bit. Get it all shaped up?
001:10:22|LMP|I think it's fine. Now the one thing I forget about this is this zoom.
001:10:30|CMP|Do we want to write on this what - what we're taking pictures of? 0.5 millimeter.
001:10:46|LMP|Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5 millimeters to 75; I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoom - -
001:10:58|CDR|I would think so.
001:10:59|LMP|- - and 12.5 is wide angle. The only thing that confuses me is that it says for vehicle to vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view. Probably ... telephoto.
001:11:15|CMP|Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.
001:11:18|LMP|Okay. You didn't touch this lighting?
001:11:21|CMP|No, I didn't ... Minimum ...
001:11:29|LMP|I've got bright.
001:11:32|CMP|Focus, I'll put at infinity, and the f-stop for vehicle to vehicle is - -
001:11:58|CDR|Not much light in here.
001:12:02|CMP|- - f:2.8.
001:12:04|LMP|What?
001:12:09|CMP|Okay. I - I'll show what it looks like inside of the cabin.
001:12:27|LMP|Okay, this looks alright, I think.
001:12:30|CMP|Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yes, we'll get it. ... You want to see the monitor?
001:12:41|LMP|...
001:12:43|CMP|Yes. You want to see the monitor?
001:12:49|CDR|Is this all rceady to go; I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz.
001:13:02|LMP|Yes.
001:13:07|CDR|Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.
001:13:14|LMP|Okay.
001:13:16|CDR|There are two pieces on the back of them ...
001:13:17|LMP|You think so, huh?
001:13:18|CDR|Yes, over, just a little up toward the ...
001:13:28|LMP|Now, ... - It's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down.
001:13:53|CDR|I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.
001:13:59|LMP|Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to - know which way to move it.
001:14:07|CDR|Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.
001:14:25|LMP|Hey, there's something. How's that window?
001:14:37|CDR|When you get around there, Buzz, I'll give you the briefing (laughter). You just slid out of your - -
001:14:40|LMP|I was out of my ...
001:14:57|CMP|Handkerchief or something - -
001:14:59|LMP|Where do we have to go to get a tissue?
001:15:02|CMP|All the way down to the ...
001:15:04|CDR|How about - using a piece of cloth, like - -
001:15:10|LMP|While I'm here, let me - -
001:15:11|CMP|What - what - do you want a tissue for?
001:15:14|CDR|Hey, that's a good idea. We can get rid of that stuff - -
001:15:16|LMP|...
001:15:17|CDR|- - that's a good idea; good head.
001:15:22|LMP|Brilliant ...
001:15:23|CDR|I got your checklist, Mike; you want it back?
001:15:27|CMP|Yes, I'll take it back, Neil - Thank you, just put it here.
001:15:37|CMP|No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me BUZZ'S.
001:15:41|CDR|Excuse me.
001:15:44|CMP|... I'd rather have my own.
001:15:47|LMP|How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?
001:15:51|CDR|Yes, it looks fine to me.
001:15:53|LMP|Good.
001:15:56|CMP|I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on ...
001:16:06|LMP|...
001:16:07|CMP|Yes, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?
001:16:16|LMP|No, one-handed snap. ... I'm in the center now.
001:16:28|CMP|Okay, Buzz, the - -
001:16:29|LMP|Alright, I'll put yours on the left.
001:16:32|CMP|It doesn't matter, they're all good - far as I'm concerned, one's like another.
001:16:37|LMP|As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.
001:16:38|CMP|Okay.
001:16:40|LMP|...
001:16:43|CMP|This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can – on this bracket.
001:16:52|LMP|Yes.
001:16:53|CDR|Okay, that was correct. You - you were asking about that.
001:16:58|CMP|And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color; you got 15 minutes worth - 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th.
001:17:20|LMP|Okay. The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that?
001:17:31|LMP|Outside of it - on the magazine?
001:17:36|CMP|Yes.
001:17:41|CDR|How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?
001:17:44|CMP|No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.
001:17:46|LMP|... I don't know - even feel that.
001:17:49|CDR|I feel the horizon coming up.
001:17:52|CMP|Oh, yes.
001:17:54|CDR|Buzz, are you ready to - -
001:17:55|CMP|... 90 degrees the wrong way - -
001:17:58|CDR|- - are you ready for this briefing? Buzz?
001:18:00|LMP|Yes, let me get this.
001:18:01|CDR|Oh! Okay.
001:18:04|CMP|Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.
001:18:09|CDR|Say, we got the rookie with us; he hasn't seen so many of those.
001:18:23|CDR|(Laughter) Okay. 30 seconds.
001:18:30|CMP|Oh, no, there is a possibility.
001:18:33|CDR|We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?
001:18:42|LMP|Okay, go ahead and talk.
001:18:44|CDR|Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It works like a camera. It has the – The f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom - Your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and it's 12.5 millimeters on the middle one – See the 12.5 millimeters? That's the zoom.
001:19:18|LMP|Yes.
001:19:19|CDR|Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.
001:19:46|LMP|I think that - that's going to do it.
001:19:55|CDR|Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.
001:19:57|CMP|Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!
001:19:59|CDR|Isn't that something?
001:20:00|CMP|God damn, that's pretty; it's unreal.
001:20:08|CDR|Get a picture of that.
001:20:10|CMP|Ooh, sure, I will. I've lost a Hasselblad. ... Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far - big son of a gun like that.
001:20:40|CDR|Now, what do we have - Is that all the -
001:20:44|CMP|You had the switch down - inside. ... automatic light control features.
001:21:05|CMP|Well, that pisses me off. Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the ... Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?
001:21:17|LMP|Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it ...?
001:21:23|CMP|Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.
001:21:45|CMP|... much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.
001:22:01|CDR|And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time.
001:22:13|CMP|I've looked - I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.
001:22:21|LMP|You can go to your ...
001:22:24|CDR|It's too late for sunrise, anyway.
001:22:27|CMP|I know, but I'm worried about - -
001:22:28|LMP|But you want to get it before TLI.
001:22:30|CMP|- - I know it. That's what I'm worried about.
001:22:31|LMP|Neil, could you look around over there?
001:22:32|CDR|Yes, I'll look.
001:22:35|CMP|I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it - Do we have to throw some other switches?
001:22:41|LMP|No, the switches are all thrown.
001:22:45|CMP|... under you.
001:22:57|CMP|Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?
001:23:10|CMP|Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody ...?
001:23:18|LMP|I've looked already.
001:23:24|CMP|Ah! Here it is.
001:23:25|CDR|Find it?
001:23:26|CMP|Yes.
001:23:27|CDR|Beautiful.
001:23:28|CMP|It was floating in the aft bulkhead.
001:23:30|CDR|On your side?
001:23:34|CMP|I got a way on it - of keeping it.
001:24:17|CMP|I got a little horizon. Man, look at thatl
001:24:21|LMP|Looks like what you have to do to this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up - -
001:24:27|CDR|How's the monitor, working okay for you? Anything I can do to help?
001:24:33|CMP|...
001:24:46|CMP|I found a spot that really ... my window.
001:24:50|LMP|Yes, it looks like ... I got my - -
001:24:51|CMP|Trees and a forest down there; it looks like trees and a forest or something. Looks like snow and trees. Fantastic. I have no conception of where we're pointed or which way we're going or a crapping thing, but it's a beautiful low pressure cell out here.
001:25:10|LMP|Yes, go ahead and take a picture. Keep your ... down.
001:25:15|CMP|Beautiful low pressure.
001:25:16|LMP|Must be past Hawaii by now. 01:28 is AOS.
001:25:22|CDR|Buzz, how's it going there, the monitor giving you good service?
001:25:25|LMP|Not yet - flicking an awful lot.
001:25:26|CDR|Well, that's ... - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off 22, maybe not – focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.
001:25:44|LMP|Sun is bright, isn't it? ... It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth.
001:26:00|CDR|I think you probably want sort of a wide angle - -
001:26:07|LMP|Yes, I think ... would be something ...
001:26:20|LMP|Well, if I take normal to the window, it's going to be ..., ...?
001:26:26|CDR|Yes, that would be pretty nice.
001:26:41|CDR|Getting a little of the rim there?
001:26:44|CMP|To get a little more view, you have to move down - away from -
001:27:18|CDR|Now, how we doing checklist-wise? Let's make sure we don't screw up and forget - -
001:27:22|CMP|I'm working on the attitude reference check right now.
001:27:29|LMP|Now, do we need to do anything else to configure this for ... receiver?
001:27:32|CDR|No, far as I know it's all up to them.
001:27:50|LMP|Oh, shoot; they're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI pad, TLI abort, and a P37 pad. They're all right here in this little book; don't forget to remind me of that.
001:28:02|CMP|Okay, that's good.
001:28:14|LMP|How do you think we can ...?
001:28:17|CDR|Yes, you can fold it flat; would that help you?
001:28:19|LMP|Yes.
001:28:20|CDR|That's pull - pull - -
001:28:28|CMP|See that, Buzz? You're a TV expert.
001:28:48|CMP|Now, the next big thing we got to do is, after the attitude reference check, is extend the docking probe. No big thing. Copy down a bunch of pads and then you got your RCS hotfire.
001:29:08|CMP|That booster, when that thing - -
001:29:09|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston through Guaymas. Over.
001:29:14|CDR|Roger, Houston. Reading you loud and clear.
001:29:16|CC|Reading you the same. Coming up on AOS Goldstone.
001:29:19|CDR|Roger.
001:29:21|CDR|It should be right now, Buzz.
001:29:27|LMP|Cecil B. De Aldrin is standing by for instructions.
001:29:32|CC|Houston. Roger.
001:29:40|CDR|Okay, and I got pads, need to extend the probe, and do an SM RCS hotfire.
001:29:49|CMP|That's right, that's the same way I read it. I don't know what this is, coming up.
001:29:53|CDR|When you - when you come up on this SECS LOGIC - and MSFN GO for pyro arm, don't forget to get an okay from them before you send the ... out.
001:30:09|LMP|Wow, I hope they get that; that's pretty.
001:30:11|CDR|With the sun glaring like it is, you're - you're correct on the f:22, I'm sure. It might be part of the - -
001:53:56|CC|- - and the launch - vehicle guidance are both looking to be in good shape. We estimate you have better than a 99-percent probability of a guidance cut-off on the launch vehicle. So, things are apparently holding in very well. For your information, MLA received approximately 1 minute of a usable TV picture; so, apparently the system is working. You're a little over a minute from LOS at Canary; AOS Tananarive is 2 hours 9 minutes and 18 seconds. Over.
001:54:34|CMP|Roger. We like those 99 numbers. Thank you.
001:54:38|CC|Roger. Out.
001:54:39|CDR|Okay.
001:54:40|CMP|Now, let's see. We want to go to the suit circuit - -
001:54:44|LMP|Yes, I'll get the suit circuit if I can find that valve.
001:54:50|CMP|Okay, let's see, that's the EDS POWER, ON.
001:54:54|LMP|Oh, that thing is hard.
001:54:59|CMP|What - what do we want here - -
001:55:00|LMP|Suit's closed.
001:55:01|CMP|- - on that VERB 48?
001:55:10|CDR|Ready for EDS POWER, ON, you think?
001:55:13|CMP|EDS POWER, up and ON, yes.
001:55:17|CDR|Okay, it's ON.
001:55:20|CMP|EMS FUNCTION, OFF, verify.
001:55:22|CDR|EMS FUNCTION, OFF.
001:55:23|CMP|MODE, STANDBY - EMS MODE, STANDBY.
001:55:28|CDR|Okay, it's at STANDBY.
001:55:30|CMP|EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V; set range VHF A.
001:55:32|CDR|Okay.
001:55:33|CMP|Set for 1586.8.
001:55:34|CDR|Okay.
001:55:38|CMP|Then go to NORMAL. Anybody know what we're doing with VERB 48 up there?
001:55:54|CMP|What are we supposed to be putting in there?
001:55:58|CDR|...
001:56:08|LMP|I wonder what the hell that is?
001:56:22|CMP|Just verify you got a 3 there?
001:56:25|LMP|I guess so, that's what you need.
001:56:30|CMP|That's all you need.
001:56:31|LMP|Yes.
001:56:32|CMP|I don't know what that entry is in the checklist.
001:56:33|CDR|It doesn't matter what the other numbers are.
001:56:36|CMP|No, I mean any - any other weights or anything?
001:56:38|LMP|No.
001:56:39|CMP|Doesn't seem to me, for the pad we got, we – we want to load in any - -
001:56:43|LMP|No.
001:56:44|CMP|- - any of this - stuff. That's what we got in there, anyway.
001:56:45|CDR|Yes.
001:56:46|CMP|Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.
001:56:56|CDR|We don't want to do that.
001:56:57|LMP|No.
001:56:58|CMP|It's almost the same anyway.
001:57:00|CDR|It's about the same anyway, yes.
001:57:06|LMP|Okay. You ready for the - your EMS MODE, NORMAL?
001:57:11|CDR|NORMAL.
001:57:12|LMP|EMS FUNCTION to DELTA-V TEST.
001:57:15|CDR|That's good; that light enough.
001:57:20|LMP|...
001:57:21|CMP|Now, we want a GDC align.
001:57:24|CDR|Yes.
001:57:25|CMP|Now, let's see - -
001:57:27|CDR|Minus 19.9.
001:57:29|CMP|That's alright - minus 0.1 to - can you write that one down?
001:57:34|CDR|It's real close.
001:57:37|CMP|Yes.
001:57:41|CDR|That's just about perfect.
001:57:44|LMP|Alright. EMS MODE, STANDBY.
001:57:48|CDR|STANDBY.
001:57:51|LMP|And EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V, set. Set DELTA-VC. You got the number?
001:58:03|CMP|Yes. 10 4256.
001:58:10|CDR|4256? How about 4356?
001:58:16|LMP|That's right, 4356.
001:58:25|CDR|And how about ORDEAL? Does that go back, Buzz?
001:58:28|LMP|Yes.
001:58:35|CDR|I guess we got all of those -
001:58:49|CMP|Where did all those numbers come from?
001:58:54|CDR|Yes; much better.
001:58:57|CMP|They give us a new state vector?
001:59:00|CDR|Yes.
001:59:02|LMP|Yes, they did.
001:59:03|CDR|They did, yes.
001:59:04|CMP|No, that's VERB 66. ... apogee - perigee.
001:59:25|LMP|I'll just put a question mark here about - not show our ignorance.
001:59:32|CMP|Well, looks like we're picking up a little. That sound reasonable? 1166?
001:59:40|CDR|... the time, is that right?
001:59:41|LMP|The S-IVB?
001:59:45|CMP|Yes, you add about 4 or 5 miles to your orbit - apogee - perigee.
001:59:49|CDR|Yes.
001:59:51|LMP|Yes, that's too much.
001:59:54|CDR|We're up to 6 ...
002:00:00|LMP|That thing ... now, that may not be now; that may be at TLI.
002:00:18|LMP|I don't have any reason not to believe it.
002:00:21|CDR|No.
002:00:25|CMP|If it isn't any good, we'll need another one anyway, huh? So, there isn't any point in saving the other one.
002:00:32|CDR|Okay.
002:00:33|CMP|VERB 66.
002:00:39|CDR|Okay. 10 435.6.
002:00:52|LMP|10 435.6. Alright, go to EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V.
002:01:00|CMP|DELTA-V.
002:01:01|LMP|GDC align is at - What's this "D"?
002:01:12|CDR|Huh?
002:01:13|CMP|That means ...
002:01:15|LMP|Oh.
002:01:16|CMP|Won't get them on S-band.
002:01:17|LMP|S what?
002:01:19|CMP|VHF.
002:01:20|LMP|Okay. A SIMPLEX, it should be on.
002:01:23|CMP|Set ORDEAL? Do something with it, anyway.
002:01:28|LMP|Let's see, ORDEAL is - -
002:01:29|CMP|What happened to that card that was here?
002:01:30|LMP|I already fired it.
002:01:32|CDR|What was that?
002:01:33|CMP|Um hum.
002:01:34|CDR|Saturn boost? This was a boost card.
002:01:38|LMP|Okay.
002:01:39|CMP|You can't have that.
002:01:42|LMP|You don't want that one, do you?
002:01:43|CMP|No.
002:01:44|LMP|Trade it - for a good one.
002:01:55|CMP|How about some LM pointing angles?
002:02:03|LMP|Okay, let's do one more. We're going first opportunity, you think?
002:02:22|CMP|Burn time is 05 plus 47.
002:02:24|CDR|Yes.
002:02:27|CMP|And emergency shutdown, Neil, is plus 10 seconds; 10 minus 40 on the DELTA-VC, is that right?
002:02:32|LMP|Plus 6 seconds - plus 6.
002:02:39|CMP|And - no - no, I'm sure about that minus.
002:02:43|LMP|No, no, it's not; it's only ...
002:02:45|CMP|No, it's plus 6 seconds and VI on the DSKY at G&N.
002:02:58|CDR|I think that's going to show up here, isn't it?
002:03:01|LMP|What?
002:03:03|CDR|TLI?
002:03:04|CMP|The roll?
002:03:05|CDR|Burn ...
002:03:06|CMP|They're in the damn flight plan; I don't think they're in the checklist.
002:03:27|LMP|Alright. You got ORDEAL set in some way?
002:03:30|CDR|ORDEAL is okay.
002:03:33|LMP|Well, do you want to get ahead on a few things?
002:03:38|CDR|Well, give me an example.
002:03:44|LMP|We don't need the sequence pyro arm yet, huh?
002:03:47|CDR|No. Don't want to do that until -
002:03:52|LMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER, ON?
002:03:54|CDR|It's ON.
002:03:55|LMP|ROT CONTROL POWER, NORMAL, two of them, AC/DC?
002:03:58|CDR|There you go.
002:03:59|LMP|DIRECT, two, MAIN A/MAIN B?
002:04:04|CDR|Okay.
002:04:12|LMP|LAUNCH VEHICLE indicators: GPI to S-II/S-IVB. GUIDANCE to IU.
002:04:24|LMP|That IU?
002:04:26|CDR|Yes.
002:04:27|CMP|Have we got pyros armed?
002:04:28|CDR|No.
002:04:29|LMP|No.
002:04:30|CMP|Okay.
002:04:33|LMP|CB, DIRECT ULLAGE, two of them, CLOSED.
002:04:38|CDR|Better wait awhile on that.
002:04:44|LMP|Okay, how about cranking the event timer to 51:00, then?
002:04:52|CDR|What's burn time? Ignition time? 2 what?
002:04:59|CMP|35, 30 minutes.
002:05:03|LMP|Well, that's going to be ...
002:05:08|CDR|Okay, I'll set up the event timer.
002:05:47|CDR|Burn time is 05:20.
002:06:07|CMP|DELTA-VI - going to be ...
002:06:45|CMP|Sure you got - you got your checklist here, haven't you? Yes.
002:06:48|LMP|Yes, they put all this TLI crap in my checklist; even though I took it out, they put it back in.
002:06:52|CMP|Well, Mattingly assured me that I was going to have a circular velocity versus altitude, you know, when they get me at 100 miles on the other side?
002:07:02|LMP|It's not in here, either, I looked.
002:07:04|CMP|Where would it be? It'd be right in here -
002:07:06|LMP|I finally gave it to ...
002:07:16|CMP|Hey, that's - you know what the numbers are, roughly.
002:07:24|CDR|25 - 25 550 at a 100 miles - something like that, it changes, probably - -
002:07:31|CMP|Yes, but this was to be - What do you have on this side to give you that on the other side?
002:07:49|LMP|I'm running a little bit on the warm side; how are you guys ... along?
002:07:53|CDR|Probably a tad on the warm side.
002:07:59|LMP|Suit and cabin pressures both look - I guess we should be cool.
002:08:06|CDR|Should be about 100 ... - okay -
002:08:10|LMP|Water - boiling - ... potable ...
002:08:18|CMP|Fuel cells ... water. It goes to potable tank first and then we - we get it.
002:08:24|LMP|Oh - stop there?
002:08:25|CMP|Yes.
002:08:26|CDR|Coming into the terminator.
002:08:46|CMP|Gee, I'm really disappointed over those optics; that telescope is horrible. Maybe it'll get better with practice - or adaptation, or what have you.
002:09:38|CDR|Gee, I almost went to sleep then.
002:09:40|CMP|Me, too; I'm taking a little rest.
002:09:48|LMP|It's going to be a long day.
002:10:03|LMP|How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part?
002:10:10|CDR|I haven't done the second GDC align yet; it comes up on the next page. About now, I guess.
002:10:25|CMP|Well, we should have Tananarive. How about going - pressing ahead with the sequence pyro arm?
002:10:31|CDR|Okay, let me align the GDC.
002:10:46|CDR|Well, they cleverly do this on - just on opposite sides of the world so you always have to pitch - run all the thumbwheels the maximum amount.
002:10:56|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive. Over.
002:11:03|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. Roger.
002:11:05|CC|Roger. Reading you loud and clear.
002:11:10|LMP|You get the pyro armed?
002:11:12|CDR|No, I haven't. Just a second, I'll be right with you.
002:11:24|LMP|Get 51 on the event timer?
002:11:34|CMP|We stopped boiling water.
002:11:37|LMP|That's good.
002:11:41|CDR|Old son of a gun.
002:11:46|LMP|Okay on the temperatures.
002:11:50|CMP|Looks like the setting on the AUTO thing is such that it just runs a little cold.
002:11:56|CDR|Yes, that's right. That's - that's what I think, too.
002:12:05|CMP|... have a feeling I have a ball in here.
002:12:09|CDR|Okay, the GDC is - is aligned. Ready to proceed.
002:12:15|LMP|Okay. We've got the VERB 48 in, VERB 83, ORDEAL set, and SEQUENCE PYRO ARM.
002:12:26|CDR|Okay. Stand by for a blast. One's ON. Two's ON.
002:12:35|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We have the pyros armed.
002:12:39|CDR|Okay.
002:12:40|CC|This is Houston. Roger; out.
002:12:41|LMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER's ON. ROT CONTROL POWER, NORMAL, two, AC/DC.
002:12:45|CDR|They're all up.
002:12:46|LMP|DIRECT? MAIN A/MAIN B.
002:12:49|CDR|DIRECT.
002:12:50|LMP|S-II/S-IVB.
002:12:52|CDR|Check.
002:12:53|LMP|GUIDANCE, IU?
002:12:54|CDR|IU, yes.
002:12:55|LMP|Circuit breakers, DIRECT ULLAGE, two, CLOSED.
002:13:01|CDR|Okay.
002:13:02|LMP|And the event timer's set.
002:13:06|CMP|Now, why don't you - why don't you put ORDEAL on 200/LUNAR?
002:13:15|CDR|Alright.
002:13:17|CMP|Maybe you can start figuring out what the hell that ought to be.
002:13:32|CMP|I guess - leave them on INERTIAL for the time being.
002:13:45|CDR|Beyond my ability to - compute here right now.
002:14:10|CDR|...?
002:14:27|LMP|You're not worried now on that thing.
002:14:29|CMP|When the motor lights up, he's worried.
002:14:38|CDR|... 190, 110 degrees.
002:14:50|CMP|Got a long way around, yet.
002:15:23|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. 1 minute to LOS Tananarive; AOS at Carnarvon, 02:25:30.
002:15:35|LMP|Roger.
002:15:36|CDR|02:25:30.
002:15:37|LMP|Yes. 02:25. ...
002:15:58|CMP|Why did they do that? That should be up here, before 02:35.
002:16:10|LMP|I don't know. It's screwed up in here anyway.
002:16:29|CDR|Well, weren't they giving us two abort pads before?
002:16:33|CMP|No, TLI plus 90 and TLI plus 4 hours. And now the TLI plus 4 hours is TLI plus 5 hours, P37.
002:16:44|CDR|Oh, is that right?
002:16:45|CMP|Yes. Got them on the same page.
002:16:49|CDR|Yes, they're on the same page.
002:16:50|CMP|Yes, I was expecting them to get something in.
002:17:29|CMP|Going to have to break your ... here, I mean - your LMP handhold.
002:17:35|LMP|Oh, my G&N handhold; don't do that. ... managed to hang on to it, ... up there.
002:17:44|CMP|Holding against the ... - the couch.
002:18:13|CMP|Well, let's see ...
002:18:35|CMP|Think I was that slow punching the clock?
002:18:39|LMP|Huh?
002:18:40|CMP|I wonder if I was that slow getting everything going? I ought to have given them a second or ...
002:18:56|LMP|It didn't seem to me as though there was a tremendous cue; there's no doubt that you were moving, but to say exactly what the precise time was when you started to move, I think you'd call it whenever the thing started vibrating.
002:19:12|CMP|Yes, I didn't know when the hell we were airborne; I just took his word for it. It was sure shaking, rattling, and rolling, son of a bitch!
002:19:46|LMP|Wake me up at TLI, somebody.
002:19:50|CDR|Another 15 minutes, just time to sleep.
002:19:52|CMP|You need to get out the alarm clock.
002:20:06|CDR|I don't know, I think I'll just put my window guard up.
002:20:12|CMP|Yes.
002:20:32|CMP|Whopseedoo, we picked up an S-band. No noise.
002:20:45|CDR|What's VERB 85 going to tell me - if I call that up, Mike?
002:20:50|CMP|It tells you range - range rate in C, which is the angle between your - optics line of sight and the horizon, depending on what - -
002:21:03|CDR|What's that little bump in the ... somebody?
002:21:06|CMP|That's me; I - I'm thrashing around over here a little bit.
002:21:08|LMP|I - if you wonder, I stuffed my launch checklist and - in the little gap between the -
002:21:19|CMP|You don't have a launch checklist.
002:21:22|LMP|My cue card.
002:21:23|CMP|Oh.
002:21:24|LMP|In between the - the Y-Y strut and the wall over here, to keep it from bouncing around.
002:21:31|CMP|Oh.
002:21:32|LMP|...
002:21:34|CMP|Yes, that says 58-1/2 degrees, huh?
002:21:40|CDR|Yes.
002:21:42|CMP|... 57-1/2 isn't that something like that? Now wait a minute.
002:21:50|CDR|Yes, 57-1/2 degrees.
002:21:52|CMP|I guess they're ... about on the horizon anyway. Yes, okay.
002:21:55|CDR|Huh?
002:21:56|CMP|Buzz, I put 39.5 volts over here; that's a reminder on the battery check - real good on the wall. Okay, Neil, now TLI - I'm going to write on the wall here - TLI - nominal is 05 plus 47; and 6 seconds later, it's 05 plus 53. And you want me to let you know when that is; I'll yell "cut-off" at that time.
002:22:27|CDR|Okay.
002:22:38|CMP|Now, we want to get what that time's going to be up there. Is that alright, Neil?
002:22:43|CDR|Yes, that's right. 05:53, I want it yelled.
002:22:45|CMP|Okay. I'll yell "cut-off," huh?
002:22:57|CDR|Yes, I guess. And I'll cut off if the G&N says - -
002:23:04|CMP|Agreed.
002:23:05|CDR|- - we're overburned.
002:23:06|LMP|That's right.
002:23:39|CMP|You got that TRANSLUNAR switched to INJECT, huh?
002:23:41|CDR|Yes, to INJECT.
002:23:47|LMP|EDS POWER, you got ON?
002:23:49|CDR|EDS POWER is ON.
002:23:53|LMP|PYROs are ARMED?
002:23:55|CDR|PYROs are - four breakers are in, and switches are up.
002:24:06|LMP|Okay, on this thing here, we should be reading 02:41:01, shutdown, and - -
002:24:14|CDR|Add 6 seconds to it?
002:24:15|LMP|Yes. At 07, cut-off.
002:24:48|LMP|BLOCK, BLOCK. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS?
002:24:53|CDR|It is.
002:24:57|LMP|Tank pressures looking alright?
002:25:02|CDR|Tank pressures are looking good.
002:43:18|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Slightly less than 1 minute to ignition, and everything is GO.
002:43:42|CDR|Okay, 59:25 - and this light will go off at 42 -
002:43:53|CMP|Time is based on tracking data; let me know when you start it up.
002:43:54|LMP|Okay.
002:43:59|CDR|When you feel it, that's when it is.
002:44:01|LMP|Okay, this light is out - know any of it any more.
002:44:09|CDR|Okay, we're operate - 59:59.
002:44:16|LMP|There we go; thrust.
002:44:18|CDR|IGNITION. Call it at 15.
002:44:22|CMP|Okay.
002:44:26|CDR|Whew!
002:44:27|CC|We confirm ignition, and the thrust is GO.
002:44:33|CDR|Pressures look good.
002:44:37|CMP|Flashes out window number 5.
002:44:38|MS|...
002:44:40|CMP|I'm not sure whether that's - it could be lightning, or it could be something to do with the engine -
002:44:59|CMP|Continual flashes ...
002:45:09|LMP|About 2 degrees off in the pitch ...
002:45:12|CDR|Yes, wouldn't worry too much about that.
002:45:14|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. At 1 minute, trajectory and guidance look good, and the stage is good. Over.
002:45:21|CDR|Apollo 11. Roger.
002:45:50|CMP|Don't look out window 1. If you're - if it looks like what I see out window 5, you don't want to look at it (laughter).
002:45:55|CDR|I don't see anything.
002:45:56|LMP|Why?
002:45:57|CMP|These flashes out here - -
002:45:58|CDR|Oh, I see a little flashing out there, yes.
002:46:03|CMP|You see that? Buzz is usually looking – just watch window 5 for a second. See it?
002:46:10|LMP|Yes, yes. Damn, everything's - just kind of sparks flying out there.
002:46:14|CMP|Yes, that's - Oopsedo.
002:46:16|CDR|Man, that really - -
002:46:18|CMP|That's PU shift?
002:46:19|CDR|I don't know, but it sure put a little blip in there at 2 minutes; I think it increased in thrust.
002:46:24|CMP|Think it's the PU shift?
002:46:26|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good; everything's still looking good.
002:46:32|CMP|That's about like a pitch change rather than an acceleration increase. Did it feel that way to you?
002:46:38|CMP|Okay. We got a lighted horizon at 2-1/2 minutes. Pretty horizon.
002:46:48|LMP|A fairly smooth ride, you know; it's just a little tiny bit rattly, but nothing like Stafford's – H-dot looks great. Don't bet you could do any better.
002:46:58|CMP|I'm sure I couldn't. I'd do worse because I'd be a - a full degree off from where it is right now.
002:47:14|LMP|Don't sweat that. 3 minutes.
002:47:16|CMP|3 minutes. What we got, about one g, Neil?
002:47:24|LMP|Pressures are good - -
002:47:25|CMP|Yes, we've got 3 feet per second - -
002:47:26|CDR|Just under one g.
002:47:27|LMP|Mike, we're within 3 feet per second on the card H-dot.
002:47:32|CMP|Fantastic. And it's shaking everything a little bit.
002:47:34|LMP|Shaking at 3 minutes.
002:47:35|CDR|Okay.
002:47:36|LMP|I hope that camera doesn't fall on your face.
002:47:38|CMP|I checked it; it's locked in there pretty well. Won't hurt this visor -
002:47:43|CDR|03:30 coming up - Should be 5.5, and it is 5.5.
002:47:53|CMP|Nice ride.
002:47:54|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. At 3-l/2 minutes, you're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
002:48:04|CDR|Roger. Apollo 11's GO.
002:48:07|CMP|I see a bright star out there, must be Venus. Forgot to memorize John Mayer's views out the window well enough to say that's Venus or not, but it's sure bright.
002:48:17|LMP|What would you do about it?
002:48:18|CMP|Nothing.
002:48:19|CDR|4 minutes –
002:48:20|CMP|Tell you what - that's Venus.
002:48:22|LMP|10 feet per second off on H-dot -
002:48:25|CMP|..., that's about where it is.
002:48:27|LMP|Here comes the old sun.
002:48:29|CMP|Gee, that's going to be bright.
002:48:31|CDR|Glad I got my card up.
002:48:32|CMP|I'm glad you had - you do too, Neil; that was a good idea, a hell of a good idea. I can't see - well, my tapes are ... I can't ... see very much.
002:48:42|CDR|Coming up on 04:30. How you look, Buzz?
002:48:49|LMP|Looks good. Oh, about 14 feet per second right now. The altitude's very good. We ought to get a real good 5-minute cut at the ...
002:49:12|LMP|You guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes?
002:49:14|CMP|Okay.
002:49:15|CDR|Just a second.
002:49:16|CMP|5 minutes.
002:49:17|LMP|MARK.
002:49:18|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO at 5 minutes.
002:49:21|CDR|Roger. We're GO.
002:49:23|LMP|Okay, we're just a little bit low on time.
002:49:25|CMP|Right on it.
002:49:27|CDR|... yaw.
002:49:33|CMP|... do that?
002:49:34|CDR|Yes, we better do that.
002:49:37|CMP|5 - 5 seconds –
002:49:40|LMP|What kind of g we pulling?
002:49:42|CDR|We got a 1.2 or 3 - 1.3, maybe.
002:49:46|CMP|Gee, feels a lot more than that already.
002:49:51|LMP|Okay, 6 - okay, about 5 seconds to nominal.
002:50:03|CMP|LMP
002:50:06|CDR|We have cut-off.
002:50:09|LMP|3.3 on the DELTA - -

002:50:19|CMP|SECS PYRO ARM, two, SAFE.
002:50:22|CDR|I got out - I got out of kilter here; let's go back and let Buzz pick up on it. You're just a little bit ahead of yourself on the checklist.
002:50:29|CMP|Okay.
002:50:30|CDR|Okay, Houston, you read 11?
002:50:35|CMP|Buzz, forget I read anything in the checklist.
002:50:38|LMP|Yes - -

003:18:00|CDR|She's pitching.
003:18:02|CMP|Trying - to turn itself off again; look at this.
003:18:05|CDR|Is it holding it this time?
003:18:06|CMP|Watch, it'll probably go back to RATE COMMAND.
003:18:10|CDR|That slows it down?
003:18:11|CMP|... keeps pitching.
003:18:15|LMP|Your MAN ATT, PITCH, to ACCEL COMMAND?
003:18:19|CDR|It went to RATE - Okay, I see a SLA panel going out.
003:18:23|LMP|Okay, you got to get a pitch rate in there -
003:18:30|CDR|See that SLA panel?
003:18:35|LMP|Is it flying - yet?
003:18:37|CMP|It's alright. She's darn well unbelievable - something.
003:18:47|CDR|I see it ...
003:18:50|LMP|Do I need some circuit breaker in to get - -

003:19:16|CMP|Okay. We'll stop here.
003:19:18|CDR|- - ... and we're pretty far away from him, too.
003:19:25|CMP|Okay, watch it, we should be stopping here.
003:19:40|LMP|How long do we want to run this film?
003:19:46|CDR|How does he look, Mike?
003:19:47|CMP|He's - he's fine.
003:19:52|CDR|Okay, you got 100.4 now.
003:19:54|CMP|Yes, I know; those numbers don't mean anything. They were 99-something when we turned around; don't ask me why. I thrusted toward him quite a bit, and I don't know why those numbers were screwed up, but they were.
003:20:13|CDR|Buzz, how does he look to you; looks like he's getting closer to me.
003:20:15|CMP|... get the BMAG?
003:20:18|LMP|Okay.
003:20:19|CDR|Yes, it looks like he's drifting down just a tad, and he's supposed to be.
003:20:22|CMP|How are our eight gray talkbacks; they still good?
003:20:29|CDR|Very good.
003:20:43|CMP|Flies like a spacecraft instead of a simulator. Hope that's good.
003:20:52|CDR|Sure beautiful. I hope you got some pictures, Buzz.
003:20:55|LMP|I got the 16 millimeter going - -

003:21:16|CMP|It's on the - it's printed - -
003:21:18|CDR|Yes.
003:21:19|CMP|- - yes, it's six frames at 15; I suggest toward the end you probably goose it up a little bit.
003:21:23|LMP|You want to get the whole thing?
003:21:24|CDR|I don't care - ... tell by looking at ...
003:21:32|LMP|The thing is, with this sitting there, I can't get much with the Hasselblad. That window's no good, I'm afraid.
003:21:46|CDR|Can I hold something for you?
003:21:49|LMP|Take a couple of ...
003:21:54|CMP|Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.
003:22:05|CDR|I'll do it.
003:22:06|LMP|...
003:22:15|CDR|Be sure that your RCS is working anyway.
003:22:23|LMP|How far out are you, Mike?
003:22:25|CMP|I'm still quite a ways. That's definitely a SLA panel - there's no doubt about that. Sure looks like ... panel. That stuff's hitting from the S-IVB from us. Gees, look it - that one thing just hit the - gyro package on the S-band antenna.
003:22:46|LMP|Yes, things occasionally come scooting out.
003:22:52|CMP|...
003:22:53|LMP|And, occasionally, you know, a little piece of something hits the - what do you call that - covering? The whole LM quivers every so often. All - all the surface of it, Neil, you know, just kind of shakes like that.
003:23:12|CDR|Yes?
003:23:13|LMP|Just in one spot; it's not being hit. I hope it doesn't come in ... - -
003:23:17|CMP|Stand by; we're getting pretty close.
003:23:20|CDR|Just from the APS firing, you think?
003:23:25|CMP|Stand by; we're closing.
003:24:40|LMP|Okay - -
003:24:41|CDR|We don't have too much - -
003:24:43|LMP|- - BMAG MODE, three - You should v align CM - BMAG MODE, three, to ATT 1/RATE 2?
003:24:49|CMP|Okay.
003:24:50|LMP|And we're - translated plus X. That CAPTURE PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, you've done that; CMC MODE, FREE?
003:24:54|CDR|Yes, sir.
003:24:55|CMP|Yes.
003:24:57|LMP|Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?
003:24:58|CDR|We did that.
003:24:59|LMP|Yes, you've done that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, PRIMARY 1?
003:25:01|CMP|We did that.
003:25:03|LMP|Alright, after dock - -
003:25:20|LMP|- - EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF?
003:25:21|CDR|DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF, I did that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, ... to OFF.
003:25:27|LMP|Okay, DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, two of them, OFF?
003:25:30|CDR|No, no, wait a minute. It says "DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF," huh?

003:26:01|CDR|... get this to stop ...
003:26:05|CMP|Yes, that wasn't the smoothest docking I've ever done.
003:26:08|CDR|Well, it felt good from here.
003:26:10|CMP|I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know? I thought I could about equal the simulator in ... and I didn't - I bet you I used - I hate to quote a number, but I've been down around 30-some pounds in the simulator, and I'll bet this was 50, 60 pounds, something like that. Hate to quote a number.
003:26:31|CMP|How do the - Speaking of that, how do the service module RCS quantities look?
003:26:35|CDR|Well, Buzz is fooling around with that - Let me just - -
003:26:38|LMP|They - they're all 90 except B, which is above 90.

003:27:18|LMP|Sure is squiggly, isn't it? It really wanders all over, doesn't it?
003:27:33|CMP|Neil, where do you put this guy - usually?
003:27:35|CDR|I - clip it to that - clip up there beside the COAS - you see - -
003:27:38|CMP|Okay.
003:27:39|CDR|- - see those clips up there, one of those. It's got a snap right here that's pretty good.
003:27:48|CMP|I think I can get it now - ...
003:28:10|CMP|Okay, Buzz, how am I doing on the checklist?
003:28:18|LMP|Well, I'm trying to - -
003:28:19|CDR|You're at the high gain - -

003:28:47|CMP|What? Okay.
003:28:48|CDR|I'm amazed how it just wanders around for a given setting; you notice that?
003:28:55|CMP|There - it sounds like we got it now. There's your VERB 64.
003:28:58|CDR|We got signal strength.
003:29:00|CMP|Okay. You have to really be on MANUAL for those things to be indicating correctly.
003:29:05|CDR|He was but - -
003:29:06|CMP|Okay.
003:29:07|CDR|- - this one was just kind of wandering around there - with no - -

075:50:56|CDR|Well, it's still below zero, I just - -
075:50:59|CMP|I'll bet you we're never going to catch up. Let's do it and see what happens.
075:51:09|CDR|Okay, that should be gray -
075:51:13|CMP|g feels sort of pleasant, doesn't it? We're measuring just a shadow over zero g on the g-meter.
075:51:19|LMP|Tank pressures are good.
075:51:20|CMP|Okay. The chamber pressure is holding steady as a rock. It's holding - it's building up a little bit, actually; it's up around 96 now. Gimbals are sure a little bit busier than I would have guessed.
075:51:36|CDR|That's a little more chamber pressure than they were predicting.
075:51:42|CMP|Yes, they're all plus 95.
075:51:44|CDR|We may - -
075:51:45|CMP|Shut down a little early.
075:51:46|CDR|- - shut down a little early.
075:51:48|LMP|What do you think about this crazy g-scale?
075:51:56|CDR|All your ... look okay over there, Buzz?
075:51:58|LMP|Man, I'm not going to look at them.
075:52:00|CDR|Alright, probably a good rule.
075:52:15|CMP|How about that? It's running a couple up.
075:52:16|CDR|35 more seconds, and we'll be out of mode 2.
075:52:29|LMP|Well, it's more than just - -
075:52:31|CMP|Chamber pressure continuing; it's up to about 97 - 98 percent.
075:52:35|LMP|- - more than just gray.
075:52:36|CMP|Yes, there's a little pinging in there. That might have jammed; keep your arms off the cockpit, ... all day to look at that thing.
075:52:42|LMP|Look at that thing; that's just where I want it. What do you think about that? A tad low. We're not going to - match it - ... creep up. Okay? Pressure is on INCREASE - -
075:53:04|CDR|Tank pressures are still good.
075:53:05|LMP|- - ... at the beginning.
075:53:07|CMP|Chamber pressure - -
075:53:08|LMP|Take a look at this.
075:53:09|CMP|- - is holding. Wandering off a little bit in roll; that's to be expected. Coming back.
075:53:22|LMP|Okay - -
075:53:23|CDR|We're well into mode 3.
075:53:24|LMP|- - it's going to be about 3 seconds early - cutoff.
075:53:30|CMP|Alright, cut-off nominal at 06:02; expect cut-off around 6 minutes even then, huh?
075:53:36|LMP|...
075:53:42|CMP|Okay, the rates. We're ... all three axes are about 0.1 degree per second. APS is punting back and forth.
075:53:52|CDR|I'm predicting 05:58.
075:53:55|CMP|Okay.
075:53:56|CDR|4 seconds early.
075:53:58|CMP|Right now.
075:53:59|CDR|May be - might be 5 by the time I get my ...
075:54:05|CMP|Okay, she's steering like a champ; chamber pressure sneaking up to 100.
075:54:10|CDR|Look at the ...
075:54:11|CMP|..., didn't recognize it ....
075:54:23|CMP|Pitch trim is holding a little over 2; it's oscillating between 2 and 2.4, roughly. Yaw trim is oscillating between minus 0.5 and zero. It's just sort of aimlessly wandering back and forth between those values. Rates are still wandering; they're deadbanding the rates in all three axes; they're plus or minus 0.1 a degree.
075:54:53|CDR|We're now predicting 5 seconds early, 05:57.
075:54:57|CMP|Chamber pressure is 100 psi even.
075:55:11|CMP|Ball number 1 and ball number 2 both right on value. Roll zero, pitch 225, roughly, and yaw 348; and hold.
075:55:29|LMP|Okay, going to get the DELTA-V switches OFF right at shutdown?
075:55:34|CMP|Shutdown, I'll get both DELTA-V THRUST, NORMAL switches, OFF.
075:55:38|CDR|10 seconds.
075:55:40|CMP|Okay. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, - -
075:55:48|MS|...
075:55:49|CDR|SHUTDOWN.
075:55:50|CMP|Okay, now.
075:55:51|LMP|Ball valves closed - -
075:55:52|CMP|50 seconds.
075:55:53|LMP|- - barber poles - -
075:55:54|CMP|Okay.
075:55:55|LMP|All four. Standing by for the gimbal motors.
075:55:56|CMP|Alright. PITCH 1 - OFF.
075:55:57|LMP|Got it.
075:55:58|CMP|YAW 1, OFF.
075:55:59|LMP|Got it.
075:56:00|CMP|PITCH 2, OFF.

075:56:08|LMP|1, OFF; 2, OFF.
075:56:10|CMP|MAIN BUS TIE is OFF.
075:56:11|LMP|Okay.
075:56:12|CMP|1, OFF; 2, OFF.
075:56:14|LMP|Man, man!
075:56:15|CMP|Alright.
075:56:16|CDR|Understand.
075:56:17|LMP|Look at the residuals. PROCEED.
075:56:20|CMP|PROCEED? Copy them down; we're not going to trim them.
075:56:22|MS|...
075:56:23|CMP|... minus 1, minus 1, plus 1. Jesus!
075:56:27|LMP|Got them.
075:56:29|CMP|I take back any bad things I ever said about M.I.T. - which I never have.
075:56:34|CDR|Okay, will you just leave them, now? They vary around.
075:56:35|LMP|Alright, get the EMS, too.
075:56:37|CMP|Okay, EMS says minus 6.8.
075:56:39|LMP|Got it. You got them on the ... switches?
075:56:43|CMP|Minus 6.8 to the DELTA-V to B.
075:56:45|CDR|... flight plan.
075:56:47|LMP|Alright, no nulling residuals. EMS FUNCTION to OFF, we got that ...?
075:56:51|CMP|1 minute - Neil's got it. We got it, minus 6.8. Okay, stand by on OFF on EMS. What else you got, Buzz, in the way of a checklist?
075:57:02|LMP|The EMS MODE, STANDBY?
075:57:04|CMP|STANDBY.
075:57:05|LMP|BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 2?
075:57:06|CMP|Three to RATE 2.
075:57:07|LMP|ATT DEADBAND, MAX?
075:57:08|CMP|ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
075:57:09|LMP|PCM BIT RATE, LOW?
075:57:13|LMP|ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, two of them, OFF?
075:57:14|CMP|DIRECT, two, is OFF.

075:57:17|CMP|PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN. Proceed.
075:57:21|LMP|Okay, proceed. Okay, VERB 82 in there. Go to P00. Well, that isn't what it says, but -
075:57:30|CMP|Well, it's good.
075:57:45|CDR|I think we're going to have to - Well, we'll leave this here anyway ... magazine ...
075:57:48|CMP|What goes in this VGX column?
075:57:53|LMP|That was the - that's the VGX residual at – before you spin.
075:58:00|CMP|Okay.
075:58:02|LMP|So just read the ... A.
075:58:04|CMP|Alright.
075:58:10|CDR|That was a beautiful burn.
075:58:12|CMP|God damn, I guess.
075:58:14|LMP|Whoo! Well, I have to vote with the 10 crew, that thing is brown.
075:58:19|CDR|Yes.
075:58:20|CMP|Sure is.
075:58:21|CDR|Looks tan to me.
075:58:23|LMP|But when I first saw it, at the other sun angle - -
075:58:24|CDR|Yes?
075:58:25|CMP|It looked gray.
075:58:26|LMP|- - it really looked gray.
075:58:27|CDR|Yes.
075:58:28|CMP|More - more sun angle you get - -
075:58:29|LMP|It got more - more brown - with increasing sun angle.
075:58:35|CMP|Okay.
075:58:36|LMP|It's a long ways off.
075:58:37|CDR|Alright, let's - Okay, now we've got some things to do -
075:58:43|LMP|Okay, let's do them.
075:58:48|CDR|We got to do a VERB 66.
075:58:51|LMP|Hey, wait a minute - alright.
075:58:53|CMP|Buzz will want to do a VERB 82; now, I don't know what comes first here.
075:58:55|LMP|Yes, VERB 82.
075:59:08|CMP|Well, I don't know if we're 60 miles or not, but at least we haven't hit that mother.
075:59:11|LMP|Look at that! Look at that! 169.6 by 60.9.
075:59:15|CMP|Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
075:59:17|LMP|What - what'd it say - -
075:59:18|CMP|You want to write that down or something?
075:59:19|LMP|- - 60.2.
075:59:20|CMP|Write it down just for the hell of it. 170 by 60, like gangbusters.
075:59:28|LMP|We only missed by a couple of tenths of a mile.
075:59:36|CMP|Hello, Moon; how's the old back side?
075:59:41|LMP|Well, it's - -
075:59:42|CDR|VERB 66, alright?
075:59:43|LMP|VERB 66.
075:59:47|CDR|We won't need that other vector ever again.
075:59:49|LMP|Now, we're - PCM, LOW, and we want to turn the TAPE RECORDER, OFF?
075:59:52|CMP|Yes, why - I don't care.
075:59:53|LMP|Okay.
075:59:54|CMP|Why don't you go PCM, LOW, and don't worry about the tape recorder; it's got 2 hours.
075:59:57|LMP|Okay.
075:59:58|CDR|Okay, we'll look at service module RCS - and SCS -
076:00:07|CMP|I want to look at the DAP again and enter a VERB 48, ENTER.
076:00:14|LMP|What was our ...?
076:00:16|CDR|1500.
076:00:24|CMP|Okay.
076:00:26|LMP|You got all your things logged now?
076:00:30|CMP|Yes, sir, I'm all logged.
076:00:31|LMP|Okay.
076:00:34|CDR|Now, it says what we do is roll 180 and pitch down 70.
076:00:39|LMP|That do it? Alrighty, let's go to SCS and do it.
076:00:45|CDR|And -
076:00:53|LMP|Don't waste all the gas, now.
076:00:55|CMP|... When I get around there, I'll pitch down 70, huh? What are we pitching down for, what, what, what - -
076:01:01|CDR|We're going to - what we're - -
076:01:02|CMP|I don't even know what we're doing.
076:01:04|CMP|LMP
076:01:05|CDR|Well, we're going to roll over and pitch down so we're looking out the front windows, down at the - -
076:01:10|CMP|Oh, yes, okay.
076:01:11|CDR|Okay?
076:01:12|CMP|We can pitch down - ... picture - -

076:01:14|CMP|- - can we take a picture - -
076:01:15|LMP|- - ... pitch attitude.
076:01:16|CMP|Yes.
076:01:17|CDR|Now, we're going to have high gain, and then we're - -
076:01:18|CMP|How would you - -
076:01:19|CDR|- - going to be able to - -
076:01:20|CMP|- - like it with the - -
076:01:21|CDR|- - look at the moon ahead of us, coming out the window right now.
076:01:22|CMP|Can we see the earth horizon from here?
076:01:23|LMP|Well, we ... - -
076:01:24|CDR|We should be able to ...
076:01:25|LMP|- - ... precise. What was the time we got on it, Neil?
076:01:28|CDR|Yes, we can - -
076:01:29|LMP|Neil?
076:01:31|CDR|What's that?
076:01:32|LMP|What was the time we got on it?
076:01:34|CDR|Burn time?
076:01:38|LMP|No, no - -
076:01:39|CDR|Burn time or what?
076:01:41|CMP|We want the big camera, huh? Big lens or small one?
076:01:46|CDR|Oh, it doesn't really matter.
076:01:48|LMP|80 millimeter will probably be as good for - -
076:01:50|CMP|For the earth coming up?
076:01:51|CDR|No, for the earth - -
076:01:52|LMP|No, for the earth coming up, we want 250. Might take some - -
076:01:54|CDR|- - not sure we can get the earth coming up - -
076:01:55|LMP|- - might take some - some luck to get that, but - -
076:01:59|CMP|Here, you want -
076:02:03|CDR|Tape recorder still running?
076:02:04|LMP|Yes.
076:02:06|CMP|It doesn't matter, we've got 2 hours on that tape, and they don't care if you run out. As long as you're on BIT RATE, LOW.
076:02:18|LMP|Okay, infinity, at f:11 - and 1/250th, huh?
076:02:28|CMP|Okay, let me get my - let me get my gouge out here. I got my gouge - -
076:02:30|CDR|You might want to back off a half stop to get the earth -
076:02:33|CMP|Are you - you black and white or color?
076:02:35|LMP|Color.
076:02:37|CMP|Alrighty.
076:02:38|LMP|Moon ..., 5.6; earth ..., 11; ... terminator, 1.8 - -
076:02:44|CDR|You think it's on your - your spotmeter reading for the earth?
076:02:54|CMP|Which way are you maneuvering now, friend?
076:02:58|LMP|5.6 at - 5.6 at 1/250th is probably - -
076:03:01|CMP|Are you rolling?
076:03:02|CDR|Rolling?
076:03:03|CMP|You are, aren't you?
076:03:04|CDR|I'm rolling right.
076:03:07|CMP|Boy, they rate some rough country over there.
076:03:09|CDR|You might get it coming sideways here; stand by in case it does. What's the AOS time?
076:03:15|LMP|It was 15 with the burn. 15:23, something like that.
076:03:23|CMP|Just be with you in 10 seconds, Neil; I just want to get my - -
076:03:27|LMP|We ought to be able to get it - -
076:03:28|CMP|- - book put back together here.
076:03:29|LMP|- - a couple of good shots.
076:03:33|CMP|The earth's going to be over here?
076:03:35|CDR|AOS, 76:15. That's exact - -
076:03:38|LMP|Can you verify that you got the state vectors transferred with the VERB 83?
076:03:41|CDR|I'll do that.
076:03:47|LMP|Now, what else we got?
076:03:49|CDR|Coming up there.
076:03:53|LMP|... Eyeballing and chattering. We got the burn status report? That's all?
076:04:02|CMP|Ready to go.
076:04:05|LMP|Okay, that looks good. Give me a VERB - 64.
076:04:12|CDR|What happened?
076:04:27|LMP|Ought to wash this window over here - -
076:04:28|CDR|You have a map so we can look at ...
076:04:30|LMP|Anybody got a - -
076:04:31|CMP|Yes, it - -
076:04:32|LMP|- - anybody got a Kleenex?
076:04:33|CDR|Yes, I think I've got one. Here you go.
076:04:40|CMP|Here's one; it's a little moist, though.
076:04:43|LMP|...
076:04:49|CMP|Well, one more ... burn.
076:04:53|LMP|Two more.
076:04:57|CDR|You got two more.
076:04:59|LMP|Yes, ... got a few more.
076:05:05|CMP|Look at those craters in a row. You see them right - going right out there?
076:05:07|CDR|...
076:05:08|CMP|Look at that line of them.
076:05:10|CDR|...
076:05:13|LMP|...
076:05:15|CMP|Something really peppered that one. There's a lot less variation in color than I would have thought, you know, looking down?
076:05:26|LMP|Yes, but when you look down, you say it's brownish color?
076:05:29|CMP|Sure.
076:05:32|LMP|Oh, golly, let me have that camera back. There's a huge, magnificent crater over here. I wish we had the other lens on, but God, that's a big beauty. You want to look at that guy, Neil?
076:05:43|CDR|Yes, I see him.
076:05:45|LMP|He's coming your way.
076:05:48|CDR|That dark spot.
076:05:50|LMP|Oh, let me - here, let me - -
076:05:53|CMP|Well, there's no doubt that this is a little smaller than the earth - -
076:05:57|LMP|Look at that one.
076:05:58|CMP|- - would you look at that curvature?
076:06:01|LMP|Where is that dark spot?
076:06:02|CDR|The dark spot's right up here. You want to get the other lens on?
076:06:06|LMP|Yes.
076:06:07|CMP|Don't you want to get the earth coming up? It's going to be 9 minutes.
076:06:11|LMP|Yes, let's take some pictures here, first.
076:06:15|CMP|Well, don't miss that first one.
076:06:16|LMP|See how am I doing. Yes, you're right.
076:06:21|CDR|We'll need - we need to catch it about 10.
076:06:27|CMP|Shoot, you're going to have plenty of passes.
076:06:30|LMP|Yes, right.
076:06:33|CMP|Plenty of earthrises, I guess.
076:06:37|CDR|Yes, we are.
076:06:38|CMP|Are we about there?
076:06:40|CDR|Boy, look at that ... crater. You can probably see him right there.
076:06:44|CMP|Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.
076:07:05|CMP|Hope none of those meteors come by right now.
076:07:18|CMP|Let me look through the sextant, Neil.
076:07:41|CMP|Well, where's the freaking earth going to be now? I'm confused.
076:07:46|LMP|In plane, I hope.
076:07:50|CDR|How are you doing on your roll there?
076:07:52|LMP|Well, we got about another 60 degrees to go. When's AOS?
076:08:00|CDR|15 - we're 7 minutes away.
076:08:03|LMP|Okay.
076:08:37|CDR|What a spectacular view!
076:08:48|CMP|God, look at that moon!
076:09:20|CMP|Fantastic. Look back there behind us, sure looks like a gigantic crater; look at the mountains going around it. My gosh, they're monsters.
076:09:58|CDR|See that real big - -
076:10:01|CMP|Yes, there's a moose down here you just wouldn't believe. There's the biggest one yet. God, it's huge! It is enormous! It's so big I can't even get it in the window. You want to look at that? That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.
076:10:23|MS|...
076:10:24|CMP|Isn't that a huge one?
076:10:26|CDR|Look at the ... Did you get some pictures of that?
076:10:29|CMP|Yes, I just took one. Can take another one here when he gets around a little better. It's fantastic!
076:10:35|CDR|That's kind of a foggy window.
076:10:37|CMP|That's a horrible window. It's too bad we have to shoot through this one, but - Oh, boy, you could spend a lifetime just geologizing that one crater alone, you know that?
076:10:51|CDR|You could.
076:10:53|CMP|That's not how I'd like to spend my lifetime, but - picture that. Beautiful!
076:11:01|LMP|Yes, there's a big mother over here, too.
076:11:07|CMP|Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers; give them some scientific name.
076:11:17|LMP|It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.
076:11:20|CMP|A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.
076:11:26|LMP|Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?
076:11:41|LMP|That is, the older they get.
076:11:50|CDR|Well, we're at 180 degrees, and now we're going to want to stop that and start a slow pitchdown. We want to go - -
076:11:59|LMP|We're not going to see the earth come up over the horizon.
076:12:02|CDR|- - about 70 degrees.
076:12:03|CMP|It says pitchdown or pitchup?
076:12:04|CDR|Pitchdown, so we're looking forward.
076:12:06|CMP|Pitchdown, so we're looking forward, alright. I wonder what kind of a rate we ought to - -
076:12:11|LMP|We got 4 minutes to get down.
076:12:13|CMP|Alright.
076:12:14|LMP|Never make it. There's a couple of new craters.
076:12:25|CDR|There's a good view of that -
076:12:29|LMP|Look warm down there, Neil?
076:12:32|CDR|I sure can't tell.
076:12:35|LMP|Looks hotter than hell to me. Boy, look at the size of that one.
076:12:47|CMP|Golly! Whoo! Get another picture of that big fellow.
076:12:51|CDR|Yes. I'm going to take one out here of him.
076:12:59|LMP|I've got an Easter egg coming up, gentlemen.
076:13:02|CDR|That's good. Gosh, it's 1 o'clock already.
076:13:07|LMP|Hey, you know, we got a TV show at -
076:13:14|MS|...
076:13:15|CMP|Huh?
076:13:16|CDR|The next REV around, that is.
076:13:18|LMP|Before LOI 2.
076:13:20|CDR|Yes.
076:13:24|CMP|Could you give me a gimbal angle to pitch to?
076:13:26|CDR|What are you going to do on that one?
076:13:29|CMP|Oh, I guess - get 10 pictures of the moon.
076:13:36|LMP|What did you want, Mike?
076:13:39|CMP|A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?
076:13:54|LMP|Yes, you were at 2 -
076:13:58|CMP|296, I would guess. How many minutes we got – to AOS?
076:14:08|CDR|About another minute and a half.
076:14:09|LMP|(Coughing)
076:14:17|CMP|I rolled to slow - doubt that we'll make it. Oh, look what I got. ...
076:14:32|CMP|Golly damn! A geologist up here would just go crazy.
076:14:40|LMP|You want the flight plan?
076:14:43|CDR|Yes, please.
076:14:57|CMP|Okay, we shouldn't take any more pictures on this roll until earth comes, I don't think; this is - -
076:15:01|CDR|About out?
076:15:02|CMP|- - just about out and it's on our last color roll, so we'll switch to black and white as soon as we get to earth.
076:15:07|CDR|We might make it in time.
076:15:09|CMP|Yes.
076:15:13|LMP|There it is, it's coming up!
076:15:15|CMP|What?
076:15:16|LMP|The earth. See it?
076:15:17|CMP|Yes. Beautiful.
076:15:21|LMP|It's halfway up.
076:15:23|CDR|We ought to have AOS now.
076:15:25|CMP|You got your - -
076:15:26|LMP|Right over the LM.
076:15:28|CDR|Are you set up?
076:15:30|LMP|Just about to be cut off by the LM. Boy, does that ever look beautiful in the sextant.
076:15:36|CMP|Have you got - -
076:15:37|CDR|Okay, how about MSFN -
076:15:39|CMP|LMP
076:15:42|CDR|We're in OMNI - -
076:15:45|LMP|DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
076:15:46|CDR|- - Bravo.
076:15:48|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
076:15:52|LMP|Yes, we sure do, Houston. The LOI 1 burn just nominal as all getout, and everything's looking good.
076:16:00|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11 - -
077:41:15|CMP|That's why I'm trying to get it out.
077:42:16|CDR|No alignment this REV, huh?
077:43:02|LMP|Mike, I guess the name of the game is to go back to - B OMNI?
077:43:10|CMP|Huh?
077:43:12|LMP|Go back to B in OMNI?
077:43:17|CMP|Well, let's see - when we come over the hill next time, we're supposed to have them on the high gain, I think.
077:43:25|CDR|Not sure of that.
077:43:29|CMP|...
077:43:31|LMP|Did you use this thing?
077:43:33|CDR|No.
077:43:34|LMP|Well, let's get rid of it then; I can't see a crapping ...
077:44:26|LMP|77:44 - okay, - LOS is right on schedule.
077:44:35|CMP|77:50, we'll be at the prime meridian; now, I can set that map up so it'll tell us where we are.
077:44:43|CDR|Okay.
077:44:45|LMP|We - we're ahead on this eat period - we're behind on the last eat period or something. We got a ...
077:45:15|CMP|I think, Buzz, if you put - put the HIGH GAIN to MANUAL and go pitch 20 - yaw 360 - pitch minus 20, I guess - -
077:45:26|LMP|Minus 20; yes, that would be better.
077:45:28|CMP|- - and yaw 360 - -
077:45:29|LMP|That's okay assuming I'm at the right attitude, but I ain't going to be at the right attitude - not without wasting a lot of gas. Put -
077:45:36|CMP|That's fine, but -
077:45:42|CDR|If you did, it would be very interesting that way.
077:45:46|LMP|Yes. Oh, crap.
077:45:55|CDR|We get HIGH GAIN and we get TV at the same time - -
077:45:58|CMP|Well, I better start maneuvering then; doggone it, I've been yawed out of plane somehow. Let's see, we're pitched down - we want to pitch back up - pitched down, doggone it. ACCEL COMMAND, pitch down.
077:46:17|CDR|Okay, well - are we going to unlock the camera store and get all that claptrap put together?
077:46:23|LMP|Yes.
077:46:24|CDR|Okay.
077:46:42|LMP|Which window you want to operate out of, so I can figure out how to put the monitor on?
077:46:48|CDR|Well, I suppose the best one would be the center window, don't you think?
077:46:57|LMP|Probably, I don't know; wait until we get into attitude.
077:47:01|CDR|Get into attitude - see what we think.
077:48:19|CMP|Oh, shit; this pitch here is no good; 32, huh? Pitch 315 I want to be at, huh? Alright. They keep - all they do is they say ORB rate and that little attitude right there and right there applies to the rest of this page, all of that page, and over to this page.
077:48:46|CDR|Okay, so that's the one we'll do.
077:48:50|CMP|Okay, that's the way I'm rolling.
077:48:51|CDR|And we'll take the - we'll have HIGH GAIN - -
077:48:54|CMP|Yes.
077:48:55|CDR|- - and we'll get the camera out of the center window, if that looks reasonable.
077:49:02|CMP|Okay.
077:49:06|CDR|We'll have to give them pictures of the moon.
077:49:07|CMP|... I've been plotting on them ... 50:05.
077:49:14|CDR|We'll have a gouge as to where we are.
077:49:22|CMP|55 -
077:50:35|LMP|Outside, huh? Alright, the switch is set for outside.
077:50:41|CMP|Could I have that map that y'all were looking at before, that lunar map? Thank you.
077:51:03|CDR|Hmm - here comes the moon.
077:51:16|LMP|Really beautiful.
077:51:29|CDR|Hey, you - -
077:51:30|CMP|I wonder where we are.
077:51:31|CDR|- - we're going to stop here pretty soon, right?
077:51:33|CMP|Yes, at 315.
077:51:41|SC|(Whistling)
077:51:56|CMP|Man, that's really -
077:51:58|CDR|It really looks gray to me now.
077:52:07|CDR|...?
077:52:10|LMP|... right down toward the ground here.
078:22:10|CDR|- - and you could be busy getting up supplies if you ...
078:22:16|CMP|About a minute from AOS.
078:22:19|LMP|Okay, let's get out of this; let me get VERB 62. Okay, Mike?
078:22:22|CMP|Oh, I really need these ..., Buzz; I really need these goddam ...
078:22:26|LMP|Well, we're not going to have much of a TV unless we get high gain.
078:22:30|CMP|Alright.
078:22:32|LMP|I'll give it back to you - ...
078:22:50|CDR|You got yourself some rates going about like what you want?
078:22:55|LMP|You got - you got high gain right now, I mean the angles, right now.
078:23:00|CMP|And we're 23 - we're 30 seconds from AOS, so those angles should be okay. You reading them?
078:23:08|CDR|Minus 30 pitch - -
078:23:10|CMP|Yes.
078:23:11|CDR|- - 150 yaw, okay.
078:23:12|LMP|No, that's not 150 - that's 15. Isn't it?
078:23:14|CDR|Just a second. Yes, minus - I'm sorry, minus 31 and plus 15. Right. You got it?
078:23:27|CMP|Yes.
078:23:34|CDR|I don't know what f-stop I ought to be at - Well - See what it's doing, Mike?
078:23:42|CMP|...
078:23:44|CDR|The flicker I don't know about, the white dot is - -
078:23:47|LMP|Yes, the flicker - -
078:23:48|CDR|- - the flicker is what I'm - Nothing I can - -
078:23:50|CMP|Okay, we got it solid.
078:23:52|CDR|- - nothing you can do about the flicker.
078:23:55|CMP|Got it solid on AUTO.
078:24:07|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signal okay?
079:48:01|CMP|Another 5 minutes, Neil babe.
079:48:05|CDR|Okay.
079:48:20|LMP|This pitch angle is quite a bit off nominal; 196 instead of 212.
079:48:24|CMP|Umm.
079:48:26|LMP|16 degrees.
079:48:28|CMP|Yes, Shaffer screwed up - got to get his eccentric orbit.
079:49:21|CMP|We is there.
079:49:27|CDR|Okay, I think I got Denebola in sight; let me look at the - Sure enough, I do. And it's good enough in the telescope; let me check it through the sextant. It's even in the sextant.
079:49:41|CMP|Beautiful! Fantastic!
079:49:44|LMP|Let's burn.
079:49:45|CDR|That's MANUAL and ZERO - ZERO and MANUAL.
079:49:51|CMP|We done paid our debt to society; we done made a star check. 79:50 -
079:49:58|CDR|It used to be that you couldn't get control on LOI 2; that any burn, any attitude you made was safer than the regular attitude, but that isn't true any more.
079:50:07|LMP|Yes.
079:50:09|CMP|Okay, we got the OPTICS, ZERO?
079:50:14|LMP|Yes, I'm sure it is.
079:50:16|CMP|And we're not going to do any VERB 41, NOUN 91, any of that stuff - -
079:50:20|LMP|No ...
079:50:21|CMP|- - so you can - enter on this one.
079:50:26|CDR|Okay. OPTICS, ZERO, ZERO, huh?
079:50:29|CMP|No!
079:50:31|CDR|Supposed to be 0.7.
079:50:32|CMP|Oh.

079:50:35|CMP|VERB 37, ENTER; 40, ENTER.
079:50:46|CMP|How does that look?
079:50:48|CDR|Looks beautiful. You enter on it, huh?
079:50:51|CMP|No. Leave it there.
079:50:52|CDR|Alright.
079:50:56|CMP|Align spacecraft roll, GDC ALIGN.
079:51:06|CDR|Yes, here we go - ... doesn't look bad.
079:51:10|CMP|No, I just got through aligning it a little while ago.
079:51:42|CMP|Okay, GDC's aligned.
079:51:46|CDR|OkaY.
079:51:48|LMP|Check the circuit breakers.
079:51:50|CMP|Alright. I got - -

079:52:54|CMP|Okay, we've got - 18 minutes, roughly.
079:53:04|LMP|That TVC gimbal drive's taking up the power?
079:53:09|CMP|TVC - -
079:53:10|LMP|Putting out?
079:53:11|CMP|- - SERVO POWER?
079:53:12|LMP|No. The TVC GIMBAL DRIVE, PITCH and YAW, to AUTO. That didn't do anything, did it?
079:53:19|CMP|No. No, that didn't do a thing; servo power's what takes it.
079:53:28|CDR|You know not to leave them on too long.
079:53:42|LMP|19 seconds to ullage; two jets.
079:53:45|CMP|Okay, 19 seconds, two jets.
079:53:50|LMP|A valves only.
079:53:52|CMP|Okay.
079:54:06|LMP|What did you get out of P30 as far as HA and HP?
079:54:10|CDR|I got the right numbers.
079:54:12|LMP|65.7, 53.7?
079:54:16|CDR|You got these?
079:54:23|LMP|Yes. 65.6, 54.6. ... should get those up.
079:54:29|CDR|...
079:56:21|LMP|Now, let's see, we can take off the 16-millimeter magazines and the 70-millimeter magazines.
079:56:44|CMP|I've got your stopwatch.
079:57:46|CDR|Okay, burn time is - -
079:57:49|CMP|Light the motor.
079:57:50|CDR|- - 17 and 1 second overburn, almost ... minutes.
079:57:57|CMP|Do it right here.
079:58:07|LMP|When's TIG?
079:58:09|CMP|11.
079:58:10|CDR|80:11:36.
079:58:22|CMP|17 seconds - 17 plus 1, huh?
079:58:49|LMP|Those little - fluorescent things on there must be from the heat and transfer.
079:58:54|CDR|Where are they? On the command module?
079:58:56|LMP|No.
079:58:57|CDR|On the LM?
079:58:58|LMP|No.
079:58:59|CDR|I don't know, but the command modul's got about ...
079:59:01|LMP|Little fluorescent - circles?
079:59:04|CDR|There's one of them.
079:59:07|LMP|There's some in a lot of failures.
079:59:10|CMP|The only thing is all the engineering that went into those damn things, too. There's a lot of time and money down the pipe.
079:59:15|LMP|I mean, this big monstrosity out here, it fails -
079:59:17|CDR|Hey, we're coming up - You can see the horizon -
079:59:38|CMP|See if that looks pretty good - through the sextant and see if that doesn't come up.
079:59:47|CMP|Zap.
079:59:56|LMP|Sure has been ... back here.
080:00:05|CMP|Poor old LM is contaminated; it's got urine particles all over it; and, the way the light's shining here, they look yellow. You know, those little - I guess it probably is a little – solid now, the - everything else has boiled off and it's left a little solid.
080:00:23|CDR|..., huh?
080:00:26|LMP|... solid urine particles are ...
080:00:29|CDR|I guess.
080:00:34|LMP|Wait until the back contam - forward contamination people hear about that.
080:00:38|CDR|Yes.
080:00:41|LMP|No more urine dumps on the way to the moon. Put it all in a nice little bag and –
080:00:58|CMP|You're not - you've got plenty of black and white film, don't you?
080:01:01|CDR|Yes, plenty of black and white film.
080:01:04|LMP|... terminator, 4.
080:01:07|CMP|Use as much as you want of anything you want. 80 millimeter, 250, it's all good.
080:01:20|CMP|We got 20 minutes until TIG. Oh, excuse me, 10 minutes - 10 minutes until TIG, excuse me. A little over 10 - 80:11 - -
080:01:31|LMP|Give me a call at about 7 minutes to go.
080:01:35|CMP|Okay, right now -
080:01:36|CMP|MARK it.
080:01:41|LMP|Yes, siree; that there is rough - rough terrain.
080:01:54|LMP|I've got kind of an idea that I'm going to be getting a picture of that - ...
080:02:44|LMP|... all those characters back there.
080:03:16|CMP|8 minutes until TIG.
080:03:48|LMP|Boy, there's a crater right in the side of the wall.
080:03:54|CMP|It's a much bigger crater, and I'll be damned if it doesn't look like it just went in sideways.
080:04:02|CDR|Okay, 7 minutes. Okay?
080:04:13|LMP|... going to do it -
080:04:18|CMP|Buzz, you want to read us that checklist; we'll use my panel chart. Which checklist would you like?
080:04:32|LMP|Alright, MAIN BUS TIES coming ON.

080:07:48|CMP|Which way's it shaking, can you tell? Pitch and yaw?
080:07:54|CDR|I don't know; it goes up more on the yaw needle than the pitch needle, but I'm not sure that's indicative of anything except needle sensitivity.

080:13:42|LMP|All those listening to the tape, please report that - we need a change in the checklist.

080:13:51|LMP|No, this is about - -
080:13:52|CMP|That's right downtown.
080:13:55|LMP|- - this is 65.7 - -
080:13:57|CMP|By 54 point - -
080:14:00|LMP|We're more elliptic now, huh?
080:14:05|CMP|That's about as close as you're going to get.
080:14:07|LMP|Yes, I bet we never get circular.
080:14:10|CDR|Hey, have you got any more circuit breakers – I mean any more switches for me?
080:14:14|LMP|No. When everybody likes this one, why don't you try VERB 83 or a VERB 66 or a - suit yourself. See how much ... you put in.
080:14:33|CMP|158.
080:14:36|LMP|15.8, huh?
080:14:37|CDR|158.
080:14:40|LMP|Or 158, that's about right. Okay.
080:14:43|CMP|Everybody happy with that?
080:14:44|LMP|That's reasonable.
080:14:46|CMP|VERB 66; want to have a vote on VERB 66?
080:14:49|CDR|No!
080:14:50|CMP|Everybody in favor of VERB 66 raise their right arm.
080:14:51|LMP|Yes, yes.
080:14:57|LMP|Okay, check it again. ... Well, let's see; we didn't gain any on the old PUGS that time; we're still 0.2 behind.
080:15:14|CDR|Oh, I suspect you're right; we probably never will.
080:15:17|LMP|No. Ne should have wrapped that thing up during ...
080:15:24|CDR|Check the increase that time?
080:15:26|LMP|Huh?
080:15:27|CDR|Did you check the increase that time?
080:15:29|LMP|If it increased, it's going to stay increased from now on.
080:15:33|CDR|Okay.
080:15:34|LMP|But I waited for it to start an upward trend on the first burn.
080:15:37|CDR|Understand; that's alright.
080:15:41|CMP|Alright - back to the flight plan.
080:15:45|CDR|... 33, as I remember it - the right number - -
080:15:52|LMP|...
080:15:56|CMP|Yes, roll 180, pitch down 81, ORB rate. God damn, here comes the draft again.
080:16:11|CDR|Okay, we're supposed to start charging battery A.
080:16:18|CMP|Charge battery A, huh?
080:16:22|CDR|Let's see what we have; SPS monitor check - -
080:16:30|CMP|Two breakers out there; two breakers out there - BAT B, BAT B. BAT A, you say - Neil?
080:16:42|CDR|BAT A, yes - if you please. Charging BAT A, then on to - -
080:16:48|LMP|Then roll 180, and then we'll talk about this pitchdown, alright?
080:16:52|CDR|Then you might as well go to your - 293 INERTIAL, I guess.
080:17:05|CMP|Man, that's a gas waster. Soon as I get around here, I'll start it. We'll pass through ORB rate at some point. Takes forever and a day to get around here.
080:17:31|LMP|It's going to be a long time before that battery gets back up to 39-1/2 volts.
080:17:45|LMP|We done plumb tuckered that one out.
080:17:49|CDR|LOI 1 could've got to it, I imagine.
080:17:52|CMP|Yes.
080:18:14|LMP|Are you going to maintain ORB rate?
080:18:17|CMP|Yes, I guess so. It's going to be sort of a passthrough ORB rate kind of thing because, see if I whip - do it in a hurry, why I got to pitch down 80 degrees, stop the pitch, or stop almost all of it, except for the ORB rate amount. That's going to waste a hell of a lot of gas.
080:18:32|LMP|Do we have to do anything - to the O2 to pressurize the LM?
080:18:39|CDR|No, we haven't - small enough – DELTA-P -
080:18:46|LMP|That's 0.9.
080:18:48|CDR|0.9?
080:18:49|LMP|Yes.
080:18:50|CMP|Yes, we have to build up pressure a little bit.
080:18:55|CDR|Build up that cabin pressure just a little bit, and I'll start the DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN.
080:18:57|LMP|It says observe the lunar surface.
080:19:02|CMP|That's what it says you ought to supposed to be doing.
080:19:14|LMP|It's brown; it's brown.
080:19:17|CMP|Brown all around. There's no doubt which way that - little crater hit.
080:19:42|LMP|Here's that same one going by again, Neil, remember? That bright Job?
080:19:51|CDR|Yes.
080:20:03|LMP|Man, there's white stuff all over - and it's black right around the rim.
080:20:10|CMP|Hey, well, I'm - while this thing's rolling over, I'm going to take a pee; I'm going to go pee.
080:20:16|CDR|180, if you don't mind.
080:20:18|LMP|That's a spectacular crater.
080:20:23|CDR|Did you shoot some pictures while you were over there?
080:20:25|CMP|No, it's just going by - we'd better get it later; there will be better times. If the damn antenna isn't in the way -
080:20:42|CMP|Boy, there must be nothing more desolate than to be inside some of these small craters, these conical ones.
080:20:50|CDR|People that live in there probably never get out.
080:20:54|CMP|Yes, I think you're right. Boy, you can really see the slumping, though. Most of the - You can see where it's all gathered down in the bottom in the corner; you know, on the edge - where a lot of the white stuff has dribbled on down – and evidently it gets covered over after a while with a - a darker layer. There's always a certain amount of the white stuff right in the edges. Pretty characteristic of all of these – white conical ones.
080:21:50|CMP|Yes, you know, you can change the color of what you're looking at by moving your head to a different spot in the window - and looking in a different direction.
080:22:25|LMP|And that must be big ... right down there.
080:22:45|CMP|I haven't heard any woo-woo's.
080:22:49|CDR|Is there something we should be woo-wooing about?
080:22:56|CMP|Wait until we get the VHF on, then we'll hear the woo-wooing.
080:22:59|CDR|Okay.
080:23:18|LMP|Man, I sure hate to say it based on looking through this monocular, but there's a white spot that's just like a crater - looks like an awful lot under these small fresh ones in the bottom of this rather old crater, but right in the center of it, it looks like instead of there being a crater, looks like it's a rock. ... My eyes deceiving me.
080:23:51|CMP|How's our roll doing, Neil?
080:23:53|CDR|Oh, you got about 30 degrees to go.
080:23:55|CMP|Oh, boy!
080:23:56|CDR|Okay.
080:23:58|LMP|How far you going to roll?
080:24:00|CMP|Over and over.
080:24:30|CDR|Got that DIRECT O2 ..., didn't you?
080:24:33|CMP|Yes, just a tiny bit.
080:24:34|CDR|Okay.
080:24:42|CMP|It'd be kind of interesting to see some of this dump go on straight from polar orbit. Wonder how long it's going to take before it impacts?
080:24:53|CDR|It obviously - is not really in polar orbit if it's going off - going off that way. Yes, it's inclined to the small angle.
080:25:03|CMP|Sure looks like it.
080:25:04|CDR|It's going straight out there through. That's real funny.
080:25:13|LMP|Son of a gun, that one's got a little – little curve on it.
080:25:23|CMP|Would you believe that, Neil? One went out and curved around like that. Can you explain that?
080:25:32|CDR|I guess it just glanced off another particle or something.
080:25:35|CMP|Oh, no, no, no, no; if it's curved.
080:25:40|CDR|It had a little bubble in it that came to the surface and went kapoom and - -
080:25:43|LMP|No - -
080:25:44|CMP|There's atmospheric drag up here.
080:25:47|CDR|- - departed it with a little DELTA-V.
080:25:49|LMP|I think what's really happening is - we're rolling and - it's changing the angle that I'm looking out the window.
080:25:55|CMP|Let's see, I want to pitch down 80 degrees to - - ... 293, down 293, I believe that, I wonder what rate would be reasonable –
080:26:10|CDR|Okay, it's about 7 minutes until AOS.
080:26:17|CMP|Down 80 degrees in 7 minutes, that's - let's see, about 10 degrees per minute, 10 degrees per minute is -
080:26:31|CDR|... floating up here -
080:26:33|CMP|61 ...
080:26:38|LMP|Well, Mike probably let him out.
080:26:45|CMP|Okay, that ought to almost get it there and, damn, I don't want to see any more than that.
080:26:58|LMP|You can open the battery ... pad.
080:27:11|CMP|That ought to be enough.
080:27:31|LMP|...
080:28:02|CMP|Alright, where are we? We're pitching down. Gee, it's too bad we can't stop right here and observe the earth come up. You know, we ought to get that picture one time.
080:28:20|CDR|We probably can do it. You could stop it right here if you wanted to spend the gas.
080:28:25|CMP|Yes. That's the only trouble, the doggone gas. What are you on?
080:28:42|CMP|A picture looking out over the LM as well.
080:28:45|CDR|Yes.
080:28:46|LMP|Shouldn't be a bad picture. Why don't we stop it?
080:28:48|CMP|Okay.
080:28:56|CDR|We ought to be able to get high gain from this attitude, shouldn't we?
080:29:10|CDR|Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike?
080:29:12|CMP|Yes, we ought to get the 250 - we ought to do it at 250.
080:29:14|CDR|You've got 4 minutes; that's plenty, Now, we're going to want to - -
080:29:22|CMP|Are we at a good enough attitude? I hope so. We are out this window, babe, but we're not out that one. If the earth is right there, that's where it's coming up, huh? Better be.
080:29:34|CDR|You want color?
080:29:35|CMP|Ah - -
080:29:37|CDR|We better have color.
080:29:38|CMP|Yes, we want color.
080:29:49|LMP|I got a clean window over here so don't sweat that one too much.
080:29:53|CMP|250 - hand me your camera, Neil, and I'll change it.
080:29:59|CDR|Who's got the Hasselblad?
080:30:07|LMP|Probably over there on the shelf.
080:30:09|CDR|We got it. First quad is in - back is - -
080:30:14|LMP|That wall of that crater looks pasty through the sextant. Great big chunks of white stuff that just slumped down.
080:30:29|CDR|Did you get - ...? If you get too far over here, we may have to watch our pitch angle. We're good right now.
080:30:40|LMP|...
080:30:41|CDR|ORB rate -
080:30:45|CMP|No, we're not ORB rate.
080:30:48|CDR|The earth's going to be coming ORB rate at us.
080:30:53|CMP|...
080:31:01|CDR|Okay. Let's see, I've got to pitch up a tad then ...
080:31:06|CMP|Okay, I've still got f:8 and ...
080:31:10|CDR|250th at f:8, I think we can do it, and infinity.
080:31:16|CMP|I don't know; what's the matter with where you had it?
080:31:19|CDR|Oh, son of a gun! (Laughter) We're going backwards. Oh, well.
080:31:28|LMP|Oh dear. Dumbkopf!
080:31:32|CMP|That's it, I think, there, Neil - so pitch down.
080:31:36|LMP|Prior planning prevents poor performance.
080:31:38|CDR|Thank you. Is that right, Buzz?
080:31:40|CMP|All that - Where'd you ever hear that one, Buzz?
080:31:45|LMP|I can't think.
080:32:12|LMP|Oh, that's a bright one; I got to get that one ...
080:32:16|CMP|No lie!
080:32:25|CDR|150 - you don't want to take too many on this.
080:32:30|CMP|No. Might as well put the other one back on.
080:32:35|CDR|Well, you might save that for some earth shots.
080:32:49|LMP|Wow!
080:32:53|CDR|...
080:32:55|CMP|You got it, huh?
080:33:04|LMP|I think it focused the second one a little bit better. I think it's beautiful. Just fabulous. Not really sure what you're looking at - but there's some mighty big fresh rocks down in that crater.
080:33:37|LMP|The walls actually look pockmarked. Sure enough, and they're not filled in. Pockmarked and it looks like somebody's painted white paint vertically down the edges and then it's been eaten away.
080:34:15|LMP|... that one ... into the LM.
080:34:38|CMP|Here is the earth. Hey, I got the view over here.
080:34:44|LMP|I guess I'd better get the high gain off, hadn't I?
080:34:49|CDR|Did it just come up?
080:34:50|CMP|Yes.
080:34:53|LMP|We need that ...
080:34:56|CMP|Do we still got high gain?
080:34:58|CDR|Yes.
080:35:01|CMP|It's says minus 67 and zero.
080:35:06|LMP|Minus 67 and zero.
080:35:09|CMP|And zero.
080:35:10|LMP|Okay, MANUAL - and - AUTO - medium. There we go. Can't make up his mind between zero and - 360. Okay, we got them.
080:35:30|CDR|Okay.
080:35:31|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. ...
080:35:35|CDR|Do you want to talk to them?
080:35:39|CDR|... Roger, Houston. Burn status report follows: DELTA-TIG zero; burn time, 17; angle through the pad values, DELTA-VGX was plus 0.3; VGY, minus 0.0; VGZ minus 0.1; DELTA-VC, minus 5.2; fuel, 362; OX, 364; unbalance, plus 50, and a postburn NOUN 94, 66.1 by - -
081:40:25|LMP|Well, they look like they were made to go - That's - that's it, isn't it? Weren't they made to put here so you stow them by putting them on here instead of the way we do it?
081:40:40|CDR|...
081:40:50|CMP|Then we only have to decide what - what's supposed to go here.
081:40:55|LMP|I ... two of them.
081:41:01|CMP|Both of those - those things are in here.
081:41:05|CDR|... worry about nothing goes in there ...
081:41:22|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've played back the LOI 2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
081:41:39|CDR|Sounds good, Houston.
081:41:41|LMP|I need that film now.
081:41:44|CDR|Okay.
081:41:46|LMP|...
081:41:58|CDR|Okay, want to get film. It's a long trip to the film container.
081:42:32|CMP|You want something?
081:42:33|CDR|Oh, shoot. I'm going to have trouble getting in there.
081:43:39|CMP|How's it going, Neil? You getting any?
081:43:41|CDR|...
081:43:59|CDR|Well - Buzz, the 70-millimeter container's only got one black and white and one color in it - Isn't it supposed to - -
081:44:16|CMP|That's - that's not - that's mine.
081:44:19|LMP|You've got the wrong one.
081:44:20|CMP|No, that's not the right one.
081:44:23|CDR|The one - -
081:44:24|CMP|The one you want, Neil, is way over here in – R-13.
081:44:32|LMP|No, it's not in there; it was on my girth shelf.
081:44:34|CMP|Okay.
081:44:35|CDR|Oh, okay, there it is. Did you get that one put back?
081:44:39|CMP|No, but I will.
081:44:41|CDR|Okay, appreciate it. I had it in my mind that - our - -
081:44:47|CMP|You want to do something to the polarizing filter, Neil?
081:44:59|CDR|Uh - -
081:45:00|CMP|I'll stick it up there on the ceiling. There's a - -
081:45:02|CDR|- - not really.
081:45:03|CMP|- - we got room for it up there.
081:45:29|CMP|You want the 16-millimeter while you're down here, Neil?
081:45:31|CDR|Yes.
081:45:32|CMP|The 16-millimeter bag as well?
081:45:33|CDR|Yes, I'll take that one, too.
081:45:36|LMP|Okay.
081:45:59|CMP|Well, that - damn stuff won't stick. Haven't got a piece of Velcro on there yet.
081:46:10|CDR|You're not ...
081:47:34|CMP|Man, can't you stop some of that racket up there?
081:47:38|LMP|Huh?
081:47:52|CMP|That's the S-band - you turn your volumes down.
081:48:06|SC|(Coughing)
081:48:17|CMP|Is that better on the S-band?
081:48:19|CDR|Yes.
081:48:20|LMP|Yes.
081:48:21|CMP|Okay.
081:48:50|SC|(Sneeze)
081:48:51|LMP|There's one that's got mission rules in it – but I can't place - at the moment, put my hands on it. ...
081:50:10|LMP|It's a NO-GO - GO/NO-GO - the one one I'm looking for. Hey, that's beautiful.
081:50:28|CDR|Like this?
081:50:31|LMP|Yes.
081:50:33|CDR|That's the one we made the changes in, right?
081:50:37|LMP|Right.
081:50:40|CDR|It may be up in the - in the command module, huh? Have you got another clip?
081:50:49|LMP|For the window?
081:50:51|CDR|I thought we might just stick my – activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.
081:50:56|LMP|Right here?
081:50:57|CDR|Yes. ...
081:51:02|LMP|We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the - -
081:51:18|CDR|I'll go check around up here.
081:51:20|LMP|Oh, wait a minute, here it is. I got it.
081:51:24|CDR|I don't think the - -
081:51:25|LMP|This other one got changed.
081:51:28|CDR|No, it didn't.
081:51:31|LMP|You want to do that?
081:51:32|CDR|Yes, I can do that.
081:51:50|LMP|And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?
081:52:19|LMP|Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well - go - the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.
081:53:20|LMP|You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?
081:53:24|CDR|Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you - ...
081:53:40|LMP|...
081:53:42|CDR|Yes, dark slide in.
081:53:55|CDR|It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.
081:53:59|LMP|Alright. ... for telling me.
081:54:10|LMP|Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.
081:55:33|LMP|Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A ... - one of them is R and the other is S.
081:55:42|CDR|Yes.
081:55:43|LMP|I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.
081:55:46|CDR|Okay.
081:55:47|LMP|And the S in the surface camera.
081:55:48|CDR|Good idea.
081:55:49|LMP|Even though we're going to use them the other way.
081:56:33|CDR|Do you want to try it out in there?
081:56:36|LMP|I guess we could open the window here, just as well.
081:56:59|LMP|The window's all - frosted over.
081:57:04|CDR|Is it?
081:57:06|LMP|Well, I hate to stick my finger on it; I'm not sure which side it's on.
081:57:09|CDR|We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.
081:57:16|LMP|No, I think when the sun gets on them, it'll - ... them. Yes, the one on your side is ...
081:58:08|CDR|The black and white is magazine 2. 
082:02:05|LMP|I don't guess there's any need to tape that up now.
082:02:18|LMP|We're on the back side now, right?
082:02:20|CDR|Yes, just come into - we're just coming into sunlight.
082:02:22|LMP|And we don't get the - contrast ...
082:02:31|CDR|What's the mission time, Mike?
082:02:35|CMP|Just a second. About 82 hours even.
082:02:39|CDR|CMP
082:02:40|CMP|82:02.
082:02:42|LMP|Okay, when do you get your tracking?
082:02:44|CMP|In a little while.
082:02:47|LMP|About what time?
082:02:52|CMP|About another half hour.
082:02:56|LMP|Before 83 hours?
082:03:06|CDR|Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the sun was on it.
082:03:24|LMP|Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - ... over the horizon.
082:04:22|LMP|I don't think there's any place except in the – in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage -
082:04:33|CDR|In the card, right?
082:04:35|LMP|No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are; 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.
082:05:14|CDR|You got the flight plan handy, Mike?
082:05:16|CMP|Yes, I have; just a second.
082:05:19|CDR|I don't want it up here; I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.
082:05:26|CMP|It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the COMM.
082:06:04|LMP|12 feet per second - half an hour.
082:06:15|CMP|Did you say something about taking pictures right now?
082:06:18|CDR|No, no; stop the camera.
082:06:21|CMP|Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.
082:06:29|LMP|One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.
082:06:39|CMP|No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles.
082:06:51|LMP|Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.
082:06:59|CDR|Alright. You want one?
082:07:01|LMP|Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.
082:09:05|LMP|Hand me a towel when you get a chance.
082:09:14|CDR|... left window ...
082:09:49|CDR|This one's getting pretty well cleared off over here on the left.
082:10:03|LMP|You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.
082:11:03|LMP|All that'll do is warm it up.
082:11:42|LMP|When do we have AOS?
082:11:50|CDR|Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.
082:12:44|LMP|Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture – of the earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?
082:14:07|CMP|Unique feature - photography (laughter). ... on the top of it.
082:14:34|LMP|What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th?
082:14:52|CMP|Yes. ...
082:15:10|LMP|What do you know, it works!
082:15:18|CDR|I could sure get the stop watch, huh?
082:15:22|LMP|Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.
082:15:29|CDR|...
082:15:30|LMP|...
082:15:32|CMP|I'm just fooling around; what do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.
082:15:50|LMP|Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?
082:16:00|CDR|Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?
082:16:05|LMP|Yes.
082:16:06|CMP|Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes -
082:16:47|CDR|Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?
082:18:12|CDR|No wonder - ...
082:18:20|CMP|Uh, ...
082:18:25|CDR|... that's the reason - -
082:18:26|CMP|No, I don't think you know; I don't think you know; I don't see how you know.
082:18:30|LMP|Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?
082:18:33|CDR|What's that?
082:18:34|LMP|In the LM, this cover for the camera. Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?
082:20:01|LMP|Now, a few pictures of that and one of earthrise and - and then we'll stow it.
082:21:45|LMP|Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.
082:22:10|CDR|Do you know where the shaving cream is?
082:22:13|CMP|Shaving cream?
082:22:17|CDR|Yes.
082:22:18|CMP|Yes, I sure do; it's - -
082:22:19|LMP|In the penlight.
082:22:21|CMP|- - in the penlight compartment, huh?
082:22:53|LMP|How about this thing; you see any need to – to keep that in the LM?
082:23:07|LMP|Neil, what did you do with the - ... camera back sight?
082:23:12|CDR|I haven't had it.
082:23:13|LMP|Okay. What do you think about that?
082:23:16|CDR|I can't think of any reason why we might use it.
082:23:18|LMP|Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?
082:24:05|CMP|He's shaving.
082:24:36|CMP|I'm through with the flight plan, Neil, if you want it.
082:24:41|CDR|...
082:24:56|CDR|... razor?
082:24:58|CMP|The razor should be in there with the shaving cream, isn't it?
082:25:01|CDR|No - -
082:25:02|CMP|It wasn't?
082:25:03|CDR|- - ... shaving cream.
082:25:04|CMP|The razor wasn't in there?
082:25:06|CDR|The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but - -
082:25:11|LMP|How much time to AOS, Mike?
082:25:15|CMP|82:30 - about 5 minutes.
082:28:42|LMP|Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.
082:28:52|LMP|Hey, Mike?
082:28:53|CMP|Yes.
082:28:57|LMP|You got VHF B available?
082:28:59|CMP|What? Say again?
082:29:05|LMP|I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.
082:29:11|CMP|Not right now, not for another half hour or so.
082:29:13|LMP|No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?
082:29:21|CMP|If I'm going to record your data, I am.
082:29:30|LMP|Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.
082:30:30|LMP|... coming up now.
082:31:54|CDR|Did you get them?
082:31:56|LMP|No, sure didn't.
082:32:05|CDR|Yes.
082:32:07|LMP|But I can't see ... - I see the earth, but it's a lousy picture.
082:32:27|CMP|Could you wait just 1? I'm right in the middle of the event-timer setting.
082:32:41|CMP|Okay, Houston. We'll be doing P22 in just a couple of minutes here.
082:32:46|LMP|You want to come in, Neil? Going in?
082:33:59|LMP|Want back up?
082:34:00|CDR|No.
082:34:01|LMP|Here's your shaving cream.
082:34:03|CMP|My only problem is I'm going to come over here and grab a switch and arm this hand controller.
082:34:07|CDR|Alright. I'll be out of your way.
082:34:08|CMP|Okeydoke. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see - -
082:34:26|CDR|Okay.
082:34:27|CMP|- - whether I'm spaced properly or not, you know what I mean?
082:34:28|CDR|Yes.
082:34:29|CMP|Coach me along on when to take mark number 2, mark number 3, 4, 5.
082:34:51|CMP|And could you give me a hack on the MDC mission timer? It's going up to 35 minutes. Ready -
082:35:00|CMP|MARK it.
082:35:05|CDR|35 minutes.
082:35:06|CMP|Okay, that's good. That program alarm is normal; it will reach that when the trunnion gets down below 50 degrees.
082:35:21|CDR|Okay.
082:35:23|CMP|All I'm doing is waiting for - the time; everything else is done.
082:35:46|CDR|You holding inertial, Mike?
082:35:47|CMP|Yes.
082:35:50|LMP|No wonder the earth isn't moving.
082:36:06|CMP|Ho-hum, ho-hum. I only got set up for this thing about an hour early (laughter). Better late than never; better early than late.
082:37:04|CMP|... should be coming over the horizon here pretty soon.
082:37:08|LMP|What should be?
082:37:14|CMP|01d A-1. 0ld A-1.
082:37:20|CMP|Now, we'll see if you can find something that looks like A-1.
082:37:23|LMP|I got the earth down by the strut.
082:37:56|LMP|The problem with this window is, Neil, I think it's too cold in here.
082:37:59|CMP|Neil, I'm going to get up here and get pitch - MANUAL ATTITUDE PITCH to ACCEL COMMAND. Those hand controllers are armed, so beware.
082:38:02|CDR|Okay.
082:41:25|CMP|If I'd known you were going to be here, I'd of incorporated you into the procedures.
082:41:30|CDR|Keep looking through the periscope, then.
082:41:32|CMP|What I need is - 0.3 to 0.5 on this thing, closer to 3. I'd get it, but you - -
082:41:40|CDR|I'll watch.
082:41:41|CMP|- - just as a doublecheck - -
082:41:42|CDR|I'll watch.
082:42:11|CMP|The preflight - ...
082:42:55|CDR|That ... is working.
082:42:56|CMP|Okay, fine.
082:43:31|CMP|Okay, MARK it –
082:43:32|CMP|Number 1. They're 30-second marks.
082:43:35|CDR|Check.
082:43:47|CDR|15.
082:43:50|CMP|How many?
082:43:51|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 - 30 -
082:44:02|CMP|MARK it -
082:44:03|CMP|Number 2.
082:44:04|CDR|Okay.
082:44:05|CMP|I have a feeling somehow I got to do these ...
082:44:16|CDR|15 -
082:44:17|CMP|Okay.
082:44:26|CDR|25 -
082:44:31|CMP|MARK it -
082:44:32|CMP|Number 3.
082:44:33|CDR|Okay.
082:44:46|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 -
082:45:00|CMP|MARK it -
082:45:01|CMP|Number 4.
082:45:02|CDR|Okay.
082:45:16|CDR|15 - 20 - 25 -
082:45:29|CMP|MARK it -
082:45:30|CMP|Number 5.
082:45:32|CDR|Okay.
082:45:33|CMP|...
082:45:43|CMP|...
082:45:50|CDR|Check.
082:45:51|CMP|Checklist says - You're going to go blind doing this - ... 06 71 - confirm 7000; 06 89 confirm ... 320 7000 ... -
082:46:08|CDR|Just leave it; keep pitching?
082:46:10|CMP|Yes. But I don't know why we're getting that thrust rate there, maybe the ... getting unhappy - -
082:46:16|CDR|... look at that roll and stuff ... that yaw ...
082:46:21|CMP|Yes. It's Just like the simulator, remember that?
082:46:24|CDR|Yes.
082:46:26|CMP|It's ...
082:46:27|CDR|We're yawing pretty good. 0.4, I'd say - -
082:46:31|CMP|We're going to have to check that out.
082:46:34|CDR|- - towards gimbal lock.
082:46:35|CMP|Toward gimbal lock?
082:46:37|CDR|It's only gone 10 degrees towards gimbal lock.
082:46:40|CMP|Well, that's a pretty good error. I don't know why in the hell it does that.
082:46:48|CMP|Would you like to control the ...? I'd say we're going to keep pitching for quite a while.
082:46:59|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:47:05|CMP|Roger. Are you copying NOUN 129 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
082:47:35|CMP|Look, what gimbal angle was that when - on the pitch - when that activity started, just out of curiosity?
082:47:40|CDR|Oh, must have been around - 210.
082:47:50|CMP|Just like the simulator.
082:48:00|CMP|Okay, now, the flight plan says where we want to stop ..., that says so right here - pitch 229 is where we want to stop.
082:48:07|CDR|Okay, we've gone by that, however, quite a ways.
082:48:10|CMP|I'm sorry, let's stop, then.
082:48:12|LMP|Is that local vertical?
082:48:14|CMP|No.
082:48:21|CDR|Okay. And after those pictures, ... lunar surface.
082:48:26|CMP|You want to go back to 229 or what?
082:48:29|CDR|Let me see the flight plan just a second. Yes.
082:48:41|CMP|Might as well just - just let it stop itself, Neil.
082:48:47|CDR|I've got to - look at the - -
082:48:50|CMP|Yes, go ahead.
082:48:52|CDR|- - the ... ... like - gangbusters?
082:48:57|CMP|... 225 is ...
082:49:12|CMP|MARK -
082:49:13|CMP|02009.
082:49:23|CMP|MARK -
082:49:24|CMP|22590. Minus 00177.
082:50:00|CMP|Okay. So much for that.
082:50:28|LMP|A beautiful view out here, Neil.
082:50:34|CDR|...
082:50:51|LMP|What's the GET?
082:50:55|CMP|It's 82:51.
082:51:35|CMP|There's Mount Marilyn.
082:51:36|CDR|Yes.
082:51:55|CMP|Okay, we didn't waste any gas by doing what we did, but what we wasted gas by was that goddamn DAP activity; I don't understand that. just like the simulator.
082:52:09|CDR|Sure enough.
082:52:13|CMP|You got a good view there, Neil?
082:52:15|CDR|Yes, I sure do.
082:52:18|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.
082:52:25|CMP|All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow roll and yaw got excited, and DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS and had just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.
082:53:02|CMP|Okay.
082:53:34|CMP|Well, one P22 out of the way. Ho, ho, ho!
082:53:40|CDR|What were the results?
082:53:42|CMP|Well - -
082:53:43|CDR|Or could you tell?
082:53:44|CMP|- - they're sort of inconclusive because I marked - see, they gave me -
082:53:52|CMP|That's in work, Houston. Hey, how about holding this for just a little bit?
082:53:55|CDR|Yes, let's hold this attitude a little bit; I want to look at the - -
082:54:00|CMP|Boy, that's beautiful out there, isn't it?
082:54:01|CDR|- - TPI approach. Man, this is really something; you ought to look at this. You want to watch our approach into the landing site; you got to watch right through this window. We're coming over - we just passed Mount Marilyn. We're coming up on Maskelyne series here - straight out ahead, coming into the landing area.
082:54:21|CMP|Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
082:54:39|CDR|See the monocular -
082:54:41|CMP|I don't either, ...
082:54:44|CDR|Is there one?
082:54:50|LMP|Well, a crater - -
082:54:51|CMP|There go Sidewinder and Diamondback. God, if you ever saw checkpoints in your life, those are it.
082:54:56|CDR|But ... we don't get to see them.
082:54:58|CMP|You don't?
082:54:59|CDR|No, we roll over right here at this little - well, you see Boot Hill coming up right here?
082:55:06|CMP|Yes, yes, yes.
082:55:07|CDR|And just beyond it that's - that crater right on track there, the big one?
082:55:11|CMP|That's Mount Marilyn? Past Boot Hill?
082:55:13|LMP|No, Duke Hill.
082:55:14|CMP|Duke Hill?
082:55:15|LMP|No, I'm sorry ... that's - -
082:55:17|CDR|Duke Island, Duke Island.
082:55:20|CMP|Oh God, look at that Moltke; he's my favorite ... Look at that son of a bitch. You see all those roads - triangular roads leading right past him?
082:55:29|CDR|Yes.
082:55:30|CMP|That's US 1, I guess, huh?
082:55:31|CDR|Yes.
082:55:33|CMP|There's crater 130 over there although I can't quite see - see 129, but I can't quite see 130.
082:56:12|CMP|Can you see ..., Neil?
082:56:20|CDR|I'm not sure.
082:56:25|LMP|I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.
082:56:35|CDR|That far?
082:56:40|LMP|The one that's shorter there?
082:56:49|LMP|Houston, this is Apollo LM in the Eagle - Apollo 11 in the Eagle, and I got a beautiful view of the whole landing area.
082:57:08|LMP|Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in looking out the left window in the LM.
082:57:20|CMP|...
082:57:26|LMP|That's right.
082:58:05|LMP|Boy, that sure is eerie looking.
082:58:06|CDR|Isn't that something?
082:58:08|MS|...
082:58:10|CMP|... enough of a shot down there, but you can't find a single spot on the surface that doesn't look ... 1-degree sun angle, that's - that's just a lousy sun angle.
082:58:28|CDR|That's spectacular out there - Looks like you're flying right into the side of a mountain, doesn't it?
082:58:32|CMP|Yes, sure does.
082:58:34|LMP|I missed taking a picture of it, ...
082:58:49|CMP|Well, that was good ... Shall we go to maneuver, I mean to sleep attitude - anybody object to doin that?
082:58:59|CDR|That'd be alright.
082:59:05|LMP|Okay, I'm ready for you cats to transfer to LM power. What time GET you got?
082:59:13|CMP|80 - -
082:59:15|CDR|Get the ..., Buzz.
082:59:17|CMP|- - 83 hours. You ready to do it?
082:59:20|LMP|...
082:59:22|CMP|You ready to do it?
082:59:23|LMP|Stand by. Yes, go ahead and do it.
082:59:32|CMP|Okay.
082:59:33|LMP|You got 83 hours right now, huh?
082:59:35|CMP|Yes, 83 hours, and we're on LM power.
083:00:26|LMP|Glycol pump.
083:00:28|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on high gain? Over.
083:00:37|CMP|Okay. You want wide beam, for some reason?
083:00:39|LMP|Will you cut my SUIT POWER and AUDIO, OFF, please?
083:00:43|CMP|Yes.
083:00:51|LMP|Okay, fine.
083:00:53|CDR|Okay, going OFF now.
083:00:54|CMP|We're starting our maneuver to sleep attitude; roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero.
083:01:11|CMP|About ready to maneuver?
083:01:14|LMP|Go ahead.
083:01:16|CMP|Okay.
083:02:52|CDR|Yes?
083:03:08|CDR|You're past step 4?
083:03:41|CDR|Houston, 11.
083:03:45|CDR|What's the page?
083:03:48|CDR|Okay. We're on page - activation 12, 13, at step 4, verify descent talkbacks - gray, and they're barber pole.
083:04:20|CDR|Stand by. We've got it. We've just had – one circuit breaker out of position. We have them gray now.
083:05:18|CMP|Watch that.
083:05:20|CDR|Don't we want it dark?
083:05:24|CMP|I thought the lights were going out. Man, that voltage is really falling off.
083:05:43|LMP|Hey, Mike.
083:05:44|CMP|Yes.
083:05:45|LMP|... VHF ... circuit breaker ...
083:05:50|CMP|I can't hear you, Buzz.
083:05:52|CDR|He says, "Why don't you turn on VHF B, just for kicks."
083:05:55|CMP|Alright, I'll do it. You going to send me some data?
083:06:00|LMP|Yes, I'll get right to it.
083:06:02|CMP|Huh?
083:06:03|LMP|I'll get right to it.
083:06:04|CMP|Alright.
083:06:07|LMP|Soon as I get some COMM first.
083:06:09|CMP|Yes, because when I - because when I record your data, I'm on SIMPLEX A.
083:06:17|LMP|Yes, well, that's when you're talking at the same time.
083:06:20|CMP|Yes, okay. You want me just to turn up B now?
083:06:22|CDR|There's signal strength.
083:06:50|LMP|Hello, Houston, hello, Houston; this is Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
083:07:22|CDR|A lot of static - on the command module S-band.
083:07:27|CMP|Well, we - we should still have him.
083:07:39|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check on S-band.
083:08:04|CDR|I'm not getting them on -
083:08:08|CMP|Well, we're almost at sleep attitude; just stand by 1, and, as soon as we get there, I'll find out where they are. I'm going to dick with the DAP right now.
083:09:16|CDR|I've got nothing but static.
083:09:31|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
083:09:52|LMP|Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
083:10:00|CDR|Mike, what are you transmitting on up there?
083:10:04|CMP|Say again.
083:10:06|CDR|What are you transmitting on up there?
083:10:08|CMP|I'm transmitting right now on OMNI A, but I'm about to get new high-gain angles; just 1 second. Okay, we're there.
083:10:16|CDR|How come I - he don't hear you on INTERCOM?
083:10:21|CMP|You should hear - -
083:10:22|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11; Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
083:10:33|LMP|Roger. I read you about 4 by 4. Could you give me a short count, please?
083:10:37|CDR|Gees, I don't hear him.
083:10:43|CDR|We don't read them, Buzz.
083:10:46|CMP|He's - he's on LM S-band, Neil, apparently.
083:10:49|CDR|Oh.
083:10:50|CMP|Yes.
083:10:53|LMP|Roger. Are you copying my LOW BIT RATE? Over.
083:11:07|LMP|Roger. I'm all ready to switch to HIGH BIT RATE, if that's okay with you.
083:11:21|LMP|Standing by.
083:11:31|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Go ahead with the camera checkout. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
083:11:53|CMP|Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high gain?
083:12:01|CMP|Blap.
083:12:07|CDR|Did you hear him answer?
083:12:09|CMP|No.
083:12:10|CDR|I didn't either. Buzz is reading him, though.
083:13:04|CMP|Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high gain? Over.
083:13:18|CMP|Hey, how about asking them if they can hear me calling?
083:13:22|LMP|I don't believe they can hear you, Mike, ... sleep attitude.
083:13:26|CMP|Well, we're in sleep attitude, and I got the high-gain angles, and they should be good angles. And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.
083:13:40|LMP|Houston, Eagle. ... high gain ...
083:14:11|CDR|No go.
083:14:12|CMP|What'd he say?
083:14:13|CDR|COMMAND RESET.
083:14:14|CMP|Okay.
083:14:36|LMP|... try him again.
083:14:39|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear.
083:43:24|CMP|Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow; I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is reinstalling all that claptrap up in there.
083:43:40|CDR|Yes.
083:43:42|CMP|But -
083:43:47|LMP|...
083:43:50|CMP|What?
083:43:51|LMP|...
083:43:59|CMP|Yes, forward's okay.
083:44:15|CDR|I don't think that would be too horrible sleeping down there.
083:44:28|CDR|It's for sure it's not going anywhere; this one's bolted down two places - and this one is - -
083:44:35|CMP|You can try it. If we could find a place to put our legs back in there, it'll be alright.
083:45:13|CMP|See - it's going to be hard to get into that - sampler there.
083:45:19|CDR|No - no, that's alright. That's the place for it.
083:46:30|CDR|(Sneeze)
083:46:34|CMP|Okay, lights went out - except for all those radioactive ones in there.
083:47:12|LMP|Well, COMM's good. Son of a bitch might work.
083:47:21|CMP|Sure it'll work. Anything in a pretty cockpit like that is bound to work.
083:47:38|CMP|Well, I propose leaving the probe and drogue in here overnight. Save all - doing all that claptrap in the morning.
083:47:48|CDR|It's okay with me.
083:47:49|LMP|Fine.
083:47:50|CMP|You through in the LM?
083:47:54|LMP|How's that going to affect - -
083:47:57|CMP|Sleeping!
083:47:58|LMP|- - sleeping?
083:47:59|CMP|I'll be glad to sleep over there, alright? I don't think it'll affect that; I'd rather sleep, I'd rather sleep with the probe and drogue than have to dick with it in the morning.
083:48:06|LMP|Alright, that's fine; I can have it there. I don't know how I'd get out, but - (laughter).
083:48:13|CDR|...
083:48:15|CMP|That's ..., alright.
083:48:25|LMP|Hey, you don't want to bring this one back? You on a weight-saving kick for the command module?
083:48:35|CDR|You want it?
083:48:37|LMP|Sure, you - -
083:48:38|CDR|There's room for the Hasselblad.
083:48:39|LMP|- - you got stowage space?
083:48:42|CDR|You can have it if you want it.
083:48:45|LMP|You got a place to fix things that rattle around?
083:48:50|CMP|Sure. Like hatches? ... if you'll take time to get out of the hallway.
083:49:01|LMP|Let's get some music.
083:49:03|CMP|Get out of my damn hallway, Aldrin, so I can put my hatch in and then we can all - -
083:49:06|LMP|How about these tapes?
083:49:09|CMP|Okay.
083:49:37|LMP|Okay, 95:50 IVT to the LM. What time is it now?
083:49:44|CMP|83:53.
083:49:50|LMP|I figure that as being 12 hours. About time for a Lomotil, huh? Well, not quite.
083:50:37|LMP|How about the systems stuff - to put the machine to bed.
083:51:01|CMP|You go to REACQ and NARROW?
083:51:02|CDR|Yes.
083:51:05|CMP|So I guess the COMM's pretty well taken care of?
083:51:08|CDR|Yes.
083:51:09|CMP|Have you got the waste water dump?
083:51:10|CDR|No, I haven't done that, but I will.
083:51:12|CMP|Let's see, I imagine we want to go out of VOICE? Or not?
083:51:17|CDR|Very, very - -
083:51:18|LMP|The whole bit they said.
083:51:24|CMP|Okay.
083:51:57|CMP|Lunar orbit asleep; (cough) S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE?
083:51:58|LMP|I did it.
083:51:59|CMP|Got that, huh?
083:52:00|LMP|Yes.
083:52:01|CMP|HIGH GAIN, REACQ, NARROW; antenna pitch angle - -
083:52:06|LMP|Yes, I did that.
083:52:07|CMP|- - that's all it says.
083:52:08|LMP|Okay.
083:52:10|CMP|Plus the normal configuration.
083:52:13|LMP|Doesn't it say anything about DOWN VOICE BACKUP - or any of that stuff?
083:52:16|CMP|(Cough)
083:52:31|CMP|No.
083:52:33|LMP|Okay.
083:52:37|CDR|Waste water dump, we'll wait until 84 hours; they may have the vent modeled or some crazy thing like that, so I want to be at the right time.
083:52:45|LMP|Alright.
083:52:47|CMP|Well, let's see, normal lunar configuration. Well, it is DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
083:52:52|LMP|Yes.
083:52:54|CMP|Well, let's get going here. PRIMARY, PRIMARY, HIGH, VOICE, (cough) PCM, RANGE, DOWN VOICE BACKUP, AUX TAPE, OFF; TELEMETRY to DATA; and UP TIM COMMAND to NORMAL; VHF A and B, OFF; RECEIVE only, ...; PCM/ANALOG, RECORD, FORWARD, NORMAL, NORMAL - that's okay, LOW - PRIMARY, REACQ, and NARROW. Well, COMM's set.
083:53:56|LMP|Good.
083:53:57|CDR|I got to vacuum up some water and dump the waste water tank, and we're about set.
083:54:05|CMP|Hey, I got a fuel cell - O2 - -
083:54:09|CDR|Hey, our water's about all gone.
083:54:10|CMP|Did they say anything about the O2 purge?
083:54:13|CDR|Must have gone into the LM.
083:54:14|CMP|Yes, I think it did; it went on the windows. They didn't say anything about it, huh?
083:54:17|LMP|No.
083:54:18|CMP|Well, I guess we'll do it then. Anybody get my - Well, heck, I guess we're really not through with them yet, are we?
083:54:36|CDR|I updated the LOS time in your -
083:54:39|CMP|Yes. I think I'll wait until we get them back again before doing the purge. Okay? Because, I don't know, maybe they want all that stuff done on the back side.
083:55:11|LMP|Well, I propose to give myself a little bit of a - a bath, but not to put that damn LCG on tonight. You never did ask them about the - about the ..., huh? I sure haven't found them.
083:55:40|CMP|I think we ought to do that.
083:56:00|CMP|Neil, you still got that tissue dispenser, the empty one?
083:56:06|CMP|Thank you.
083:56:27|LMP|What's baseline altitude? ... the altitude - descent altitude settings?
083:57:01|LMP|That's the - that's the last meal we eat before descent, huh?
083:57:12|LMP|Sure is.
083:57:26|CMP|Wowee!
083:57:27|LMP|95 - that's - 7 - got 10 hours. Whew!
083:57:44|LMP|Might whip out that piece of bread in there.
083:58:43|LMP|Through in the tunnel, Mike?
083:58:46|CMP|Through, yes.
083:58:47|LMP|Okay, I want to get the lights out then.
083:58:48|CMP|Okay, ...
083:59:29|LMP|What are your dosimeters reading?
083:59:38|CMP|... up a little bit.
083:59:41|CDR|Mine says - 11012.
083:59:50|CMP|I can't read this little fart. Says 10013.
084:00:03|LMP|I think they all started out at even thousands. They had them each different so they could tell which was which.
084:01:13|LMP|Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll raid the pantry for some bite-size stuff.
084:01:24|LMP|I don't know when we'll get a chance to use it  maybe some time - -
084:01:26|CMP|Monoculars?
084:01:30|LMP|- - during the maneuvers.
084:01:32|CMP|Found it, huh?
084:01:34|CDR|We're going to take that into the LM.
084:01:36|CMP|Yes. Sure can.
084:01:55|CDR|...
084:01:58|CMP|... - ... novel and earn a million dollars.
084:02:19|CMP|Amazing how quickly you adapt - Why, it doesn't seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?
084:02:25|SC|(Laughter)
084:02:27|LMP|Oh, that is weird - that crazy moon out there again, huh? Funny-looking thing.
084:03:12|CMP|Buzz, this crazy bracket goes right here. It's probably right the hell in your way, isn't it?
084:03:17|LMP|No, no.
084:03:18|CMP|Not in your way?
084:03:19|LMP|No, I can survive with that.
084:03:21|CMP|Alright, let me put it up there; it'll be one less thing to do in the morning. It's in backwards, but I don't think -
084:03:33|CMP|Well, if I don't need this thing anymore, I think It'll stow that one away. Systems are yours tomorrow?
084:03:44|CDR|Yes.
084:03:45|CMP|I don't know as we've got much to do; there's a purge.
084:03:50|CDR|Is it 84 hours yet? Yes, it is; I'm going to dump the waste water.
084:04:36|CMP|You dumping?
084:04:37|CDR|Yes.
084:04:42|LMP|(Cough) Boy, it's a dusty vehicle in here. Man! But that view approaching the landing site is just fantastic right out - right smack out the window, you know that?
084:04:52|CDR|Yes.
084:04:53|LMP|Except there's such a big shadow being cast by everything - -
084:05:01|CMP|1 or 2 degrees, Neil?
084:05:02|LMP|- - that I really couldn't - -
084:05:04|CDR|I think ... - -
084:05:05|LMP|- - I could identify the Cat's Paw and I could identify the pair of craters right at the end, but I couldn't really make out the backward V nor the three little curved ones on one side - -
084:05:17|CMP|I didn't see the backwards either.
084:05:18|LMP|- - but I could see the area where it all was, you know, and - -
084:05:19|CMP|Yes, yes.
084:05:21|LMP|- - it didn't go any farther back that this, and it didn't really go any farther forward than that - it really didn't. You know, it was rougher than a cob (laughter).
084:05:27|CMP|Rougher than a cob, but I didn't see ...
084:05:31|LMP|Well, when you compare it with the surrounding areas, why it's - it's pretty reasonable.
084:07:21|CDR|You want this somewhere?
084:07:23|CMP|...
084:07:42|CDR|If you don't mind, I'll put it on this big piece of Velcro over here by the fuel cell.
084:07:52|CMP|Yes, that's a good place for it.
084:09:46|LMP|Anybody for a barf bag?
084:11:08|LMP|Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil?
084:11:19|LMP|Huh?
084:11:27|CDR|I can't think of any use for two of them.
084:11:31|LMP|Okay.
084:15:24|LMP|That COMM was so good I don't think I'd need those damn things ...
084:16:29|CMP|Anybody say anything about terminating battery current?
084:16:33|LMP|No.
084:16:45|CMP|You remember anything about that, Neil?
084:16:48|CDR|No.
084:18:12|CMP|Somebody's blue towels? Did I dislodge those by mistake or did you have those?
084:18:18|CDR|No, don't believe I had them.
084:18:20|LMP|I had them out, kind of floating around back here.
084:18:38|LMP|Everything I think you could dislodge, they forgot to put Velcro on the damn thing.
084:19:31|CMP|Could you - maybe reach back and - hand me that wrench right quick?
084:19:40|CDR|Yes, I sure could. Sure could ...
084:19:54|CMP|You want me to swap one?
084:20:00|CDR|No, I think I'll keep one for tonight.
084:20:03|CMP|Okay.
084:20:26|CDR|Thank you.
084:20:27|CMP|You're welcome.
084:21:56|CMP|You like this?
084:21:58|CDR|Not much.
084:22:04|CMP|...?
084:22:27|LMP|Want one?
084:22:29|CDR|Yes.
084:22:30|LMP|He's getting a ... of that, huh?
084:22:34|CMP|Well, I just want to make sure I'm through with the roll; I think I am.
084:22:42|CDR|Can't figure out how you tell when one's gone. I think that was it.
084:22:50|CMP|Oh, it stopped!
084:23:49|LMP|It's a bear to get in and out of here.
084:23:54|CDR|Think maybe it'd be easier if you ... them right here.
085:12:01|CMP|I have a bit of fruitcake left over from somewhere; if anybody wants some, here it is. ...
085:12:25|CMP|Let's have a little chewing gum. Anybody like some chewing gum?
085:12:39|CMP|40 - and 250.
085:12:54|SC|43 ...
085:17:03|CDR|- - 1000 pounds - ...
085:17:07|CMP|That'll bring some more junk back here.
085:18:46|CDR|Couldn't have done better myself.
085:39:47|CMP|It may be raunchy later.
085:39:56|LMP|It may be? There's no doubt about it!
085:40:02|CDR|Oh, I'll take a couple small ones.
085:40:05|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and AOS will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over.
085:40:17|CDR|We'll see you on the other side.
085:40:45|LMP|Anybody have one?
085:40:47|CDR|I'll have a little one.
085:40:48|LMP|Okay. Here you are.
085:41:28|CMP|Yes.
085:41:29|CDR|Okay.
085:41:47|CMP|I guess what I'm doing I should do with the paper towels.
085:42:56|CDR|Everybody through with the water?
085:43:00|LMP|Yes, go ahead.
085:44:08|LMP|Ever find your box?
085:44:11|CMP|No. Gosh, you remember when they told us about - about putting buttons on the seat of these pants?
085:44:27|CDR|No, I don't remember.
085:44:33|LMP|Yes, they were working out - this elaborate scheme.
085:44:38|CMP|Yes, ... had a choice between ... and Velcro.
085:44:52|CDR|What's its use? I mean, don't keep me hanging in suspense.
085:44:55|CMP|Well, whatever I tell them, they didn't give me.
085:44:57|CDR|Shouldn't have anything.
085:44:59|LMP|Nothing in it.
085:45:01|CDR|Good grief, man!
085:45:02|CMP|They tell me you got to use Velcro on there. Maybe on the other side.
085:45:08|CDR|Use -
085:45:12|CMP|I got a - pair of jockey shorts. Now cut - cut the lights off - lights off.
085:45:28|CMP|Very good, very good.
085:48:14|CMP|How'd you sleep last night, Buzz, up on top?
085:51:59|LMP|You open up the outer one, and you put the inner one in there and squeeze it and it breaks, then you got to take the ... and insert it and mush it all up - to get that stuff evenly distributed through it.
085:52:25|LMP|Why don't you guys sleep underneath tonight? I'll sleep top deck.
085:52:34|CDR|Oh, you're going to sleep downstairs tonight, aren't you?
085:52:36|LMP|Yes, that's right; I remember ...
085:52:40|CMP|Unless you'd rather sleep up top, Buzz; I like - you guys ought to get a good night's sleep, going in that damn LM - How about - which would you prefer? Is that probe and drogue going to be in your way over there?
085:52:51|LMP|No, I don't think so.
085:52:54|CMP|Well, take your druthers, whichever you prefer.
085:55:57|LMP|Anybody ... goes right up here?
085:56:01|CDR|I've just been kind of looking around for it myself.
085:57:16|CMP|..., Buzz?
086:01:11|LMP|...
086:01:15|CDR|What?
086:01:17|LMP|I ... you.
086:01:18|CDR|Oh.
086:01:19|LMP|...?
086:01:20|CDR|Yes, yes.
086:01:50|LMP|Yes, I ...
086:02:08|CMP|Well, I thought today went pretty well. If tomorrow and the next day are like today, we'll be safe.
086:08:12|CDR|You got a crater coming up, Buzz? Right through here. I don't know if you can see it or not. If not, let me get a picture of it because it's really - got big ... on the bottom of it. It don't look good.
086:08:29|CMP|It's out this way.
086:08:30|CDR|Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
086:08:31|LMP|Shoot ... here.
086:08:32|CMP|I'm not sure we should be shooting this – what we're shooting at or 1 point set; I guess you're alright - in this light stuff, I guess you're alright.
086:08:46|CDR|Okay, thank you.
086:08:49|LMP|Oops! ...
086:13:39|CMP|What time is it, Neil, 88 hours, something like that?
086:13:42|CDR|86:13.
086:15:54|CDR|Doesn't it look like some of these crater walls had scallops inside like a design in a fan – like feathers.
086:16:05|LMP|Seashells.
086:16:06|CDR|Yes.
086:16:07|LMP|Like seashells - very pretty, very symmetrical.
086:17:37|CDR|Take along one of those craters.
086:17:57|CDR|I took overlapping pictures of all that ...
086:18:03|LMP|Tomorrow, take - we're going to have to carry a lot of film to take as many pictures as they want.
086:18:56|CMP|I'll tell you what we ought to do, ...
086:18:59|LMP|Oh, okay, let me go do that.
086:19:51|LMP|Anybody know when AOS is?
086:20:07|CMP|When is AOS?
086:20:09|LMP|Yes. When is AOS ...?
086:20:18|LMP|86:38?
086:20:21|CMP|I think it's ...
086:20:24|LMP|Okay.
086:20:37|CDR|... along in here.
086:20:41|LMP|Yes.
086:24:48|CMP|Where the hell is the horizon with the world coming over it? I guess it's behind us, huh?
086:24:58|CDR|Up there? We should be getting earthshine – earthrise features - should be coming up pretty soon.
086:25:10|CMP|Black and white.
086:25:12|CDR|There's a colored one right in there - I didn't think we put it there. ...
086:25:17|CMP|Alright.
086:25:35|CDR|There's this one - where's - -
086:25:39|CMP|The dark slide I think is right over there in the girth shelf.
086:25:42|CDR|Oh, yes, I got it.
086:26:59|LMP|That's - that's the one.
086:27:41|LMP|Are we going to keep the ... lens on?
086:27:45|CMP|... getting earlier in time. Yes, that's best - better.
086:28:14|CMP|...
086:28:23|CDR|Got a MASTER ALARM coming on here.
086:28:48|CMP|Your f:8 is 250 - at infinity?
086:28:52|LMP|Yes.
086:28:53|CMP|Good deal. Keep working, you got a lot of film.
086:29:36|CMP|Well, it's ...
086:29:49|LMP|And I was ...
086:29:52|CMP|Good deal.
086:29:54|LMP|...
086:29:56|CMP|Glad to hear it.
086:29:59|CDR|Through?
086:30:01|LMP|Yes - ...
086:30:04|CMP|It's good ...
086:30:06|LMP|Yes, I guess so. Nothing like filming your ...
086:30:22|LMP|... this field of view, it's mostly just blues - I keep getting mostly black and blue.
086:30:36|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
086:30:43|CMP|Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute, the TUNE FOR MAX needles have been wandering up and down and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just filling - finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off, and it'll be coming off in just a second.
086:31:15|LMP|Huh? Is that right? Really should have looked.
086:31:51|CDR|... flow?
086:31:59|CMP|RATE to HIGH, Neil.
095:32:37|LMP|I'll need to holler across to you to get the mission timers on. Do we want to check and get our two mission timers SYNC'd? What's this one read now? 82:50?
095:32:51|CDR|51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 - -
095:32:56|LMP|Okay, this one is 1 second slow down in the LEB.
095:33:28|LMP|Let's see, these things come in the command module don't they, those umbilicals?
095:33:34|CMP|...
095:33:43|LMP|Well, we don't want them.
095:33:50|CMP|...
095:34:01|CDR|Anyway, it compares.
095:34:04|CMP|...
095:34:13|LMP|Well, we couldn't do that without switching - well, you can have them in here all the time.
095:34:18|CMP|... there's no way for me ... probe and drogue ... docking ...
095:34:32|CDR|No, I can't think that that'd be of significance between them - because why would you ever care to whether you'd hook them up again, if you came back and docked?
095:35:29|LMP|Here's this LCG check. "Verify ... stick visible in red or green band."
095:35:40|CDR|Yes. Not ... as it should be.
095:35:47|LMP|The red one comes out this far, and the green one's out further than that. The whole thing is only about that long. It's got to be in one or the other or you can't see it.
095:36:24|CDR|Having any luck there, Michael?
095:36:27|CMP|...
095:36:40|LMP|You don't need to take - you're not taking your scissors over there?
095:36:43|CDR|No.
095:36:44|CMP|I've got ...
095:36:49|LMP|... pad; I'm going to have to take a leak here.
095:38:50|LMP|Yes, I guess I'd better take that pocket – and the purse. Tell you what - How about putting those tissues in that box that's got that spare camera in it?
095:39:16|CDR|Okay.
095:39:17|LMP|It'll be right handy on your side over there. Now where did the tissue box go?
095:39:39|CDR|You want to see if the computer agrees with that mission timer?
095:39:42|LMP|I did already.
095:39:44|CDR|Okay.
095:41:20|LMP|Can you hand me that purse and the - that bag of mine - and the checklist?
095:42:06|LMP|And if you'll take me off of suit power.
095:42:10|CDR|Okay. SUIT POWER is OFF; AUDIO is OFF. Whoops - Sorry.
095:44:21|CMP|...
095:44:26|CDR|Good.
095:45:07|CDR|About ready for a little help? ... that.
095:46:00|CDR|What's that?
095:46:04|CMP|... I only have one ... left.
095:46:13|CDR|Okay. Oh, let's see, one smell - blah.
095:47:15|CDR|(Humming)
095:48:12|CDR|Okay.
095:48:58|CDR|You want one?
095:48:59|CMP|...
095:49:00|CDR|Yes.
095:49:02|CMP|...
095:49:43|CDR|We've got a roll rate in; 0.3-degree roll rate. Now it's taking it out; now it's taking it back out the other way.
095:50:34|LMP|... Now, let's see.
095:50:41|CDR|I'll keep an eye on ... for you.
095:51:04|CDR|... on here.
095:51:06|LMP|Okay, I'm going on.
095:51:08|CDR|Okay.
095:53:30|CDR|What's that?
095:53:34|LMP|Did you repress, huh?
095:54:24|LMP|How come you don't ... LM power?
095:54:26|CMP|Okay. Stand by. You're on LM power. What?
095:54:38|CDR|What did he say?
095:54:39|LMP|...
095:54:41|CMP|Oh, what time is it? It's 95:54.
095:55:12|CMP|Now, switch from RATE, HIGH, to RATE, LOW. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.
095:55:21|LMP|...
095:55:35|CMP|I guess that's right then, Neil; it rattles across the deadband at a fairly high rate.
095:55:44|LMP|...
095:55:46|CMP|Alright.
095:56:31|LMP|...
095:56:34|CMP|Sure as hell is.
095:56:50|CMP|I can't get that ...
095:56:53|CDR|This one - this one? That won't hurt it. ...
095:59:09|CMP|Stand by for some MASTER ALARMS; I'm purging.
096:00:28|LMP|...
096:00:30|CDR|Oh, ..., Mike.
096:00:34|CMP|It's 96 hours even. 96 even and coming up on 40 seconds. Ready -
096:00:40|CMP|MARK it.
096:00:48|LMP|...
096:00:50|CMP|Okay, 96:01 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
096:01:00|CMP|MARK -
096:01:01|CMP|96:01.
096:01:03|LMP|3, 4, 5.
096:01:06|CMP|Good.
096:02:01|CMP|Okay, stand by for more thruster firing here.
096:04:06|CDR|Is this - -
096:04:09|CMP|No, this one's yours. You going to wear this for - -
096:04:11|CDR|...
096:04:12|CMP|Okay, I'm going to ... camera out of its way.
096:04:33|LMP|...
096:04:40|CMP|Okay, I wouldn't be surprised .... all over this goddam stuff.
096:05:00|CMP|A three-ring circus. I got a fuel cell purge in progress and trying to set up cameras and brackets, watch an AUTO maneuver, and -
096:05:22|CMP|Jesus Christ!
096:07:58|CMP|NORMAL, NORMAL.
096:09:19|CMP|Another MASTER ALARM coming.
096:10:52|CMP|Stand by for MASTER ALARM.
096:12:54|CMP|Neil, where's the voice tape recorder, you know?
096:12:59|CDR|Might be in the ...
096:13:01|CMP|Okay. Oh, you son of a bitch, you! Gah!
096:13:10|CDR|...
096:16:17|CDR|...?
096:16:18|CMP|Can't get it ...; it's behind the ...
096:16:27|CDR|Yes.
096:16:28|CMP|... hard time getting anything down here ...
096:16:37|CDR|Okay.
096:16:38|CMP|You got some things up there.
096:16:41|CMP|Neil, all this food and stuff up here, you going to take with you, or drink, or eat?
096:17:47|CDR|No, I'll take ...
096:17:54|CMP|Okay. Chewing gum, you want any of that?
096:18:07|CDR|... concerned ...
096:18:12|LMP|...
096:18:19|CMP|Neil, I hate to bother you; could you get my solo book out of R-1 there?
096:18:23|CDR|What?
096:18:24|CMP|My solo book out of R-1.
096:18:28|CDR|Solo book?
096:18:29|CMP|Yes. Look - -
096:18:30|CDR|R-1?
096:18:31|CMP|Yes, it should be in R-1. Big frapping book, with a bunch of updates on the cover. Thank you, that's it. Appreciate it.
096:20:10|CMP|Neil, do you recall the highest rate you saw during this recent thruster activity? Did you say 0.4 or thereabouts?
096:20:19|CDR|What?
096:20:20|CMP|Do you recall the - any kind of body rates that you saw during that thruster activity? Didn't you say something about 0.4? Maybe – remember when the SCS was acting up?
096:20:30|CDR|Ah - -
096:23:02|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
096:23:04|CC|- - this is Houston. You can turn on the IMU. Over.
096:23:20|CMP|Houston, this is Columbia. Over.
096:23:32|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
096:23:35|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me? Over.
096:24:00|CMP|Hey, Buzz? How about - -
097:30:22|CC|Eagle, Houston. We'd like aft now and forward at AOS. Over.
097:30:25|LMP|Roger.
097:31:06|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. 30 seconds to LOS. Both spacecraft looking good going over the hill. Out.
097:34:43|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
097:34:46|CDR|Go ahead.
097:34:47|CMP|Roger. I'm getting ready to preload the probe. I'm going to disable all my roll thrusters. Would you please monitor my roll, your yaw?
097:34:54|CDR|Roger.
097:36:41|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
097:36:43|CDR|Go ahead.
097:36:45|CMP|I got another "Verify capture latches engaged" on my checklist. I've already preloaded the probe; it's sort of silly, but sort of your option whether you want to verify they're engaged or not.
097:36:56|LMP|Okay, we got the hatch all latched up now, and we're getting ready for pressure-integrity check; so, why don't you go ahead?
097:37:04|CMP|Okay.
097:39:57|LMP|Mike, let us know how you're coming up there now and then.
097:40:01|CMP|I'm doing just fine. I've cocked eight out of the 12 docking latches, and everything is going nominally.
097:40:07|LMP|Okay.
097:41:14|CMP|All 12 docking latches are cocked.
097:41:17|LMP|Okay.
097:41:21|CMP|And I'm ready to button up the hatch.
097:46:46|LMP|Hey, Mike. Have you got the - got to the tunnel vent step yet?
097:46:52|CMP|I'm just coming to that. What can I do for you?
097:46:55|LMP|Well, we're waiting on you.
097:46:56|CMP|Okay.
097:46:59|LMP|We're still ahead of the timeline, so take your time.
097:47:03|CMP|Okay.
097:47:14|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to LM tunnel vent.
097:48:13|LMP|You got it all vented now?
097:48:17|CMP|Negative, it's a slow process. I'm on VENT, but - it's just going to take a little while here.
097:48:22|LMP|Roger. Just give us a call. We're pressing on with some other stuff.
097:48:26|CMP|Okay.
097:51:39|CMP|How's our attitude holding?
097:51:42|CDR|Looks good.
097:51:43|CMP|Okay, this - this thing's supposed to take about 8 minutes; we've got about 3 of them gone, so in about another 5 minutes, I should be able to turn my thrusters back on.
098:01:03|LMP|Moving in.
098:01:04|CDR|How you doing, Mike?
098:01:06|CMP|Doing just fine. The - Stand by, I'll give you the DELTA-P reading - 3.0; I need 3.5 before I can turn my thrusters back on.
098:01:16|LMP|Okay.
098:04:59|CMP|I've got a 3.5 psid now; I'm going to start a maneuver here in a few minutes to depressurize it.
098:05:05|LMP|Okay.
098:05:12|CMP|How you - how you guys doing?
098:05:15|LMP|Okay. We're doing our regulator checks now.
098:05:21|CMP|So I heard.
098:07:21|CMP|I'm starting the maneuver.
098:12:08|LMP|How long you got - to end this maneuver, Mike?
098:12:12|CMP|Oh, about another 2 or 3 minutes we should be there - no, less than that.
098:14:02|CMP|We're there; we're at the new attitude.
098:14:07|CDR|Okay, we're going to put our gear down.
098:14:29|LMP|... MASTER ARM - -
098:14:34|CDR|Okay.
098:14:35|LMP|LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE.
098:14:37|CDR|Here we go, Mike.
098:14:46|LMP|Bam, it's out. Ain't no doubt about that.
098:14:50|CDR|And it's gray.
098:14:52|LMP|Alright. Your ED LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
098:14:57|CDR|LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
098:15:00|LMP|Alright, fire it again.
098:15:03|CDR|Okay.
098:15:05|LMP|Nothing happened, huh?
098:15:06|CDR|Right.
098:15:07|LMP|Okay, now - -
098:15:08|CDR|I heard it click.
098:15:09|LMP|Yes, so did I.
098:15:10|CDR|That relay, I suppose.
098:15:12|LMP|MASTER ARM, OFF.
098:15:13|CDR|It's OFF.
098:15:14|LMP|CB(11), ED LANDING GEAR FLAG, OPEN.
098:15:23|CDR|The gear went down okay, Mike.
098:15:26|CMP|Good deal.
098:18:40|CDR|Columbia -
098:19:13|LMP|Loud and clear.
098:19:45|CDR|Columbia, do you read Eagle?
098:19:47|CMP|Eagle, do you read Columbia?
098:19:51|LMP|Yes, I'm working on the high gain right now.
098:19:54|CMP|Okay, I'm reading him loud and clear.
098:20:14|LMP|You in the right attitude, Mike?
098:20:17|CMP|That's affirm.
098:20:29|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You're loud and clear.
098:21:51|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Over.
098:22:08|CMP|Buzz, you on the forward OMNI?
098:22:10|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Over.
098:22:15|CMP|Buzz, are you on the forward OMNI?
098:22:17|LMP|Roger. I am.
098:22:20|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Eagle is on the forward OMNI.
098:22:39|LMP|Columbia, go ahead.
098:23:13|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
098:23:19|LMP|Roger. I got you now. I fed in those angles for the S-band, and I couldn't get a lockon; it appears as though the antenna would have to be looking through the LM in order to reach the earth. Over.
098:24:03|LMP|Roger. Ready to copy.
098:24:32|LMP|Roger. LM weight, 33627; CSM weight, 36651; pitch trim, 00470; roll trim, 00589. Over.
098:25:02|LMP|Roger. Understand.
098:25:12|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Do you read?
098:25:29|CMP|Roger. S-BAND VOICE to VOICE. How do you read now?
098:25:45|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
098:25:53|CMP|Houston, Columbia in DOWN VOICE BACKUP. Do you read?
098:26:04|CMP|Affirmative. Columbia in DOWN VOICE BACKUP. How do you read me?
098:26:20|LMP|Roger. Eagle's in VOICE mode. How do you read? Over.
098:26:34|CMP|Houston, Columbia's in OMNI C, Charlie, DOWN VOICE BACKUP and, when you get a chance, could you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have conflicting information between my cue card and my flight plan. I'd like to know which coordinates you want me to use.
098:27:04|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Completed gear extension okay.
098:27:54|CMP|Thank you, Houston.
098:29:14|CMP|Yes, I had the coordinates loaded off the cue card which is - for crater 130.
098:31:29|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
098:33:11|LMP|Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT before we can proceed on with the AGS, and we need you to watch our DAP data load, gimbal drive check, and throttle test. Over.
098:33:54|LMP|Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and the throttle check since we don't have a gimbal drive test, okay?
098:35:31|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Those T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
098:35:40|CMP|I say, the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, affirmative?
098:35:53|CMP|Thank you.
098:37:56|LMP|Houston, Eagle.
098:38:03|LMP|Roger. In accordance with the - page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and MODE CONTROL, PGNS, AUTO; and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet, so when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now - why, we got an RCS TCA light, and we've got four out of the eight other bright-colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in - PGNS and AUTO and just unable to fire the thrusters. Over.
098:39:21|LMP|Roger.
098:40:00|CDR|Houston, Eagle. Are you going to need the high gain before you can look at our GDA position indicators?
098:40:35|CDR|I can go to a high ...
098:40:41|LMP|I can give you HIGH BIT RATE on the OMNI's if that will help you any.
098:40:59|CDR|Roger. Understand.
098:41:39|CMP|Boy, you just can't miss those checkpoints – those Diamondback and Sidewinder.
098:42:21|CMP|AUTO optics is pointed just a little bit north of crater 130; pointing north.
098:44:13|LMP|Houston, Eagle. We're ready to pressurize the RCS. Over.
098:44:50|LMP|Roger.
098:44:57|LMP|That's affirmative; the landing gear is out and gray.
098:45:53|CMP|Houston, Columbia. I've completed my marks. I've gone ACCEL COMMAND in all three axes to prevent that thruster firing that last time.
098:46:47|CMP|Houston, Columbia. As soon as you have the necessary data on the downlink, let me know and I'll proceed.
098:46:59|CMP|Stand by, please.
098:47:02|CMP|I will.
098:47:21|CMP|Roger.
098:47:47|LMP|Roger. Looks good.
098:47:59|LMP|Ready to copy.
098:48:33|LMP|Roger. 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
098:49:16|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. My P22 is complete. I'm continuing this maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
098:49:26|LMP|Roger.
098:49:45|LMP|Roger. Columbia, Eagle. Have you about maneuvered there, yet?
098:49:52|CMP|Negative.
098:49:59|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Are those angles for after the maneuver that Columbia is going to make or are they for right now? Over.
098:50:14|CMP|We have about another 120 degrees to go, Buzz.
098:51:10|LMP|Houston, Eagle. I believe I've got you on the high-gain antenna now in HIGH BIT RATE. Over.
098:52:30|CMP|You've got P00 and DATA.
098:52:40|LMP|Columbia.
099:29:11|CMP|Columbia, out.
099:29:16|CMP|All Columbia systems looking good.
099:31:42|CMP|It's nice and quiet over here, isn't it?
099:31:56|CMP|Eagle, you read Columbia?
099:31:58|LMP|Roger. Loud and clear.
099:32:03|CMP|Okay, everything's going well. Everything's quiet over on this side.
099:32:07|LMP|You bet.
099:32:09|CMP|Okay. I'm standing by to record your data anytime it's convenient for you; angles coming up in another 2 minutes.
099:32:31|LMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to B DATA now.
099:32:35|CMP|Roger and out.
099:33:00|LMP|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
099:33:04|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Buzz.
099:33:06|LMP|Very good.
099:33:10|CMP|...
099:34:48|LMP|Mike, are you in AGS CAL attitude now?
099:34:54|CMP|That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS CAL, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.
099:35:09|LMP|Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.
099:35:40|CMP|Okay, it looks real quiet now; I'm ready to go right now.
099:36:00|CMP|Buzz, you copy?
099:36:10|CMP|Buzz, you copy?
099:36:13|LMP|Okay, Mike. Thanks.
099:36:17|CMP|Now, ... might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go anytime you're ready.
099:36:24|LMP|Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.
099:37:46|LMP|Okay, I'm starting my 5-minute rate - right now.
099:40:00|CMP|As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll; I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.
099:40:15|LMP|Roger.
099:40:17|CMP|Looks like a ...
099:40:31|CMP|Halfway through it, it looks like I have ... degrees in roll is about all.
099:40:39|LMP|Yes, those look like good ones right now.
099:41:22|LMP|Mike, what's your SEP time?
099:41:26|CMP|A few minutes.
099:41:49|CMP|GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.
099:42:01|CMP|I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess, ...
099:42:23|CMP|I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that DELTA-V be in the same position that they wanted.
099:42:33|LMP|Yes, I agree.
099:42:38|CMP|So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed flight plan; it might be wise to try to SEP about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of SEP that's precise whenever they want it.
099:43:06|CMP|I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.
099:43:21|LMP|Roger, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.
099:43:25|CMP|No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.
099:43:45|CDR|Just hanging on - and punching.
099:43:49|CMP|I didn't know ... radio. ... I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."
099:46:21|CMP|You cats take it easy on the lunar surface; if I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.
099:46:28|LMP|Okay, Mike.
099:46:37|CDR|I just pressurized the DPS. ... looks okay, Mike.
099:46:40|CMP|Roger that.
099:49:19|LMP|Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?
099:49:29|CMP|Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head; that's hard south; so's your radio beacon.
099:49:34|LMP|Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know -
099:49:48|CMP|Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS CAL.
099:49:54|LMP|...
099:50:19|CMP|How'd the AGS CAL work out?
099:50:23|LMP|Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers.
099:50:33|CMP|Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.
099:51:21|CMP|Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation-burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your flight plan for the undock attitude.
099:51:38|LMP|Okay.
099:53:12|CMP|When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
099:53:30|LMP|Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?
099:53:33|CMP|I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
099:53:38|LMP|Yes, we're through with that now.
099:53:41|CMP|Thank you. I'm maneuvering the ...
099:58:44|CMP|That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong ... for you.
099:58:49|LMP|Very good.
099:59:56|LMP|Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?
100:00:02|CMP|Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.
100:00:25|LMP|Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?
100:00:28|CMP|Yes, f:8 at 1/250th. And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.
100:03:53|CMP|How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy?
100:03:59|CDR|That'll be fine.
100:04:05|CMP|Okay.
100:04:11|CDR|What have you got for AOS, Mike?
100:04:14|CMP|I have 100 hours and 16 minutes.
100:04:20|CDR|Okay.
100:10:44|CMP|We got just about a minute to go; you guys all set?
100:10:48|CDR|Yes, I think we're about ready.
100:11:47|CDR|We're all set when you are, Mike.
100:11:51|CMP|15 seconds.
100:12:03|CMP|Okay, there you go. Beautiful!
100:12:06|CDR|...
100:12:10|LMP|Looks like a good SEP.
100:12:19|CMP|Looks good to me.
100:12:59|CDR|Okay. I've killed my rate, Mike, so you drift out to the distance you like and then stop your rate.
100:13:13|CDR|Starting my yaw.
100:13:30|CDR|There's sure a better visual in the simulator.
100:13:38|CMP|Okay. I picked up a little roll; I'm going to get rid of it.
100:14:22|CDR|Okay with you if I start my pitch, or you think you're not far enough away yet, Mike?
100:14:31|CMP|I'd prefer you stand by just a couple of seconds, Neil.
100:14:34|CDR|Okay. I'll wait for when you're ready – when you think you've got your rates killed perfectly.
100:14:39|CMP|Okay. I'm still holding ...
100:14:41|CDR|...
100:15:26|CMP|Okay, looks pretty good to me now.
100:15:30|CDR|Okay.
100:16:34|CMP|Just like in the simulator, you're drifting off to one side and down below a little bit.
100:16:39|CDR|Yes.
100:17:06|CMP|The gear are looking good; I've seen three of them.
100:17:11|CDR|The MESA is not down, right?
100:17:14|CMP|Say again.
100:17:15|CDR|The MESA's still up?
100:17:19|CMP|Yes,
100:17:20|CDR|Good.
100:17:49|CMP|Now, you're looking good.
100:17:59|LMP|Roger. Eagle's undocked. The Eagle has wings. Looking good.
100:18:18|CMP|Okay. You've got it, P00 and DATA.
100:18:39|CDR|You check our tracking light, Mike?
100:18:44|CMP|It came on.
100:18:56|CMP|Camera's working beautifully.
100:19:00|CDR|Track off?
100:19:04|CMP|It's off.
100:19:05|CDR|I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
100:20:04|CDR|Does it look like you're going to be able to do this without firing any thrusters, Mike?
100:20:11|CMP|I'd have to fire laterally once or twice.
100:20:22|CMP|Very small.
100:20:26|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Eagle is ready to copy.
100:21:49|LMP|Go ahead.
100:21:59|LMP|That's affirmative. Go ahead with the PDI.
100:24:46|LMP|Roger. Back to BLOCK and DOI: 101:36:14.07; minus 0075.8, plus all zeros, plus 0009.8; 0057.2, plus 0008.5, 0076.4, 0:3O; 000, 293; minus 0075.9, plus all zeros, plus 0009.0; NA. Over.
100:25:39|LMP|Okay, PDI pad: 102:33:04.36; 09:50; minus 0002.1; 182, 287, 000; plus 56919. PDI less than 10: 105:12:30.00. PDI abort greater than 10: 103:40:00.00, 107:11:30.00. No PDI plus 12 abort: 102:44:37.00; plus 0122.3, minus all zeros, plus 0188.9; 0152.0, plus 0011.0, 0225.0, 0:46; 000, 190; plus 0118.7, plus 0000.0, plus 0191.1; 103:31:07.00; 105:12:30.00. Over.
100:29:00|CMP|Neil, I'm maneuvering in roll.
100:29:03|CDR|Roger. I see.
100:29:08|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the fairly large numbers for range and range rate in - VERB 83? And did you - you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
100:29:38|LMP|Okay. That explains the difference.
100:31:03|CDR|You want him to go to HIGH GAIN, YAW, zero or - say again the numbers.
100:31:17|CDR|Okay. YAW, zero; PITCH, minus 20, on the HIGH GAIN. Columbia.
100:31:24|CMP|Yes, I copy that, and I'll do it just as soon as I get to it.
100:31:27|CDR|Okay, he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.
100:31:38|CMP|Okay, Neil, I'm all set for the SEP burn, and we're looking good on this phasing.
100:31:42|CDR|Okay.
100:32:38|CMP|Columbia, read you loud and clear. Houston, how me?
101:26:54|LMP|Burn time, 30 seconds.
101:28:44|LMP|Okay, state vector looks relatively good. ...
101:29:01|CDR|Mike, how do you read?
101:29:10|LMP|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
101:29:12|CMP|Very good. How do you read me?
101:29:13|LMP|Very good. If you are ready, give the MARK and we'll go to B DATA. Over.
101:29:19|CMP|Stand by 1. I'm ...
101:29:22|LMP|Are you ...?
101:29:27|CDR|63.
101:29:56|CMP|...; they look good.
101:29:59|LMP|Okay, let's switch to B DATA now.
101:30:02|CMP|Okay.
101:30:25|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
101:30:29|LMP|Go ahead.
101:30:31|CMP|Columbia's ...
101:37:45|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. How's it going?
101:37:47|CDR|Mike, the burn's complete; it was on time - residuals are nulled, and AGS's free.
101:37:55|CMP|Beautiful.
101:42:58|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
101:42:59|LMP|Go ahead.
101:43:02|CMP|Roger. I'm ready to go back to VHF RANGING configuration. Be alright?
101:43:08|LMP|Roger. Let's go now to VHF RANGING.
101:43:11|CMP|Over and out.
101:43:20|CMP|Okay.
101:43:24|LMP|And you got VERB 76 in?
101:43:27|CMP|Yes, 76 is in ... locked up.
101:43:47|CMP|And we're ... 7.5 ...
101:43:52|LMP|Roger. That's just what we got, 7.6.
101:43:55|CMP|Okay.
101:43:59|CDR|P00?
101:44:10|CDR|8 minutes - -
101:44:11|LMP|We're in good shape - -
101:44:12|CDR|- - coming up on 8 minutes.
101:44:13|LMP|- - for ... - -
101:44:15|CDR|HIGH BIT, 8 minutes.
101:44:17|LMP|You don't have an 8-minute mark.
101:44:18|CDR|67 feet per second. Go ahead with the ...
101:44:23|LMP|Can't beat that. Okay, through with that?
101:44:26|CDR|Yes. I like it.
101:44:31|LMP|Hold on to the ... below.
101:44:35|CDR|Okay. And I'll pull the breakers - think we can ... roll.
101:44:51|LMP|Yes.
101:45:03|LMP|Got them both?
101:45:05|CDR|What?
101:45:06|LMP|Got them both?
101:45:07|CDR|Yes. ...
101:45:34|LMP|Okay, it ...
101:45:42|CDR|Going to load the PDI plus 12, right?
101:45:52|LMP|Right.
101:45:54|CDR|Okay. I'm going to start pitching down to 125.
101:46:15|LMP|No PDI plus 12.
101:46:34|CMP|I have you right down ... 65 feet per second.
101:46:38|CDR|Sounds good.
101:47:03|LMP|Okay, the camera is set. And ought to be ready to do the P52.
101:47:13|CDR|Yes.
101:47:15|LMP|Not going to be much of a drift check.
101:47:23|CDR|It - it torques them late enough to ensure that - ... the drift check.
101:47:32|LMP|Sure seems like we're going the wrong way.
101:47:42|LMP|How much do we got to go to pick it up?
101:47:46|CDR|Got to go - oh, half the moon to go, I guess.
101:48:05|CDR|Coming down already.
101:48:06|LMP|Okay. It's got us 152; it's 151; there's ..., okay? ...
101:48:44|LMP|There's 52.
101:48:54|CDR|Got 8 minutes ...
101:48:59|LMP|Now we can let us take - let it take us there.
101:49:03|CDR|No, wait; don't do that.
101:49:05|LMP|Why not?
101:49:06|CDR|I have to roll.
101:49:09|LMP|Yes, that's right.
101:49:11|CDR|In 2 more minutes.
101:49:32|LMP|Well, I did ... attitude.
101:49:37|CDR|Yes, you'll have to roll over; well, I guess I might as well do that.
101:49:45|LMP|Where's your watch? Got your stopwatch?
101:49:48|CDR|Got it in my pocket.
101:50:03|LMP|Well, the ... us over, huh?
101:50:06|CDR|...
101:50:16|CDR|And, one thing I'd appreciate if you could – see if you could - find the -

102:01:47|CDR|Okay. We'll ...
102:02:11|CDR|Cottonpicker just won't stay - try it!
102:02:16|LMP|Well, wait until we lose that descent stage, man.
102:02:19|CDR|We'd better take - a - piece of tape; hold that down.
102:02:25|LMP|How about if you get the bottom in the – get the bottom underneath this cover? That help?
102:02:34|CDR|Well, it - it's still not; I've had it in there real good couple of times.
102:02:42|LMP|Your - hoses were tearing hell out of my board.
102:02:47|CDR|Sorry.
102:02:50|LMP|You got INVERTER 1 circuit breaker in, right?
102:02:53|CDR|Checked in.
102:02:54|LMP|Okay. I'm going to check INVERTER 1. INVERTER 2 is good; and INVERTER 1 is good, and we're on INVERTER.

102:03:19|CDR|AELD is in; ABORT STAGE is in.
102:03:24|LMP|Cycle the CWEA? No, we must have lost one.
102:03:28|CDR|Yes. That cottonpicker may be trouble.
102:03:35|LMP|Well, we'll have to tell them about that. I don't know when it - when it went out, because we didn't get any light that I saw, did you?
102:03:45|CDR|I think it's just a switch. I ... if it doesn't trigger a light -
102:03:50|LMP|Something - -
102:03:51|CDR|Oh, we're in PULSE, and we're not commanding any firing - -
102:03:55|LMP|I don't know; that could have come under DOI, but I doubt it.
102:04:02|CDR|I just think that's one of those sticky flags. ... got a good engine.
102:04:11|LMP|Alright, let's see.
102:04:12|CDR|...
102:04:18|LMP|ENGINE STOP button was reset?
102:04:24|CDR|ENGINE STOP button is START, but it is going to be now.

102:04:56|CDR|That's the wrong time, right?
102:04:57|LMP|No, no, no.
102:04:59|CDR|...? PDI?
102:05:00|LMP|It's - oh - about - probably maybe a second, right here, ... 32. Okay?
102:05:09|CDR|Yes, it's about a second off.
102:05:13|LMP|If it's fast, I'll stop it; if it isn't, why, forget it.
102:05:50|LMP|You want this one over there?
102:05:51|CDR|I need this out. Burn in 46 minutes.
102:05:57|LMP|You want this one?
102:06:00|CDR|Yes. I don't - think - it'll be helpful, but I'll stick it here and pull it out if I need it.
102:06:20|LMP|Let's see; we haven't got P20 going yet, have we?
102:06:23|CDR|No.
102:06:24|LMP|Let's do that. Let's get the RENDEZVOUS RADAR circuit breaker in.
102:06:27|CDR|Okay.
102:06:34|LMP|IN. Might look at the DPS.
102:06:51|CDR|What do you hear?
102:07:00|LMP|... glycol pumps.
102:07:03|CDR|Alright.
102:07:10|CDR|Look at that. Oh, that must have been - ...
102:07:20|LMP|Okay, ascent - tank pressure - temperature's up, changed to - I don't know.
102:07:28|CDR|DPS's good -
102:07:30|LMP|Look at all that RCS we got.
102:07:35|CDR|That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?
102:07:38|LMP|Yes.
102:07:51|CDR|Got your camera rigged?
102:07:54|LMP|The other circuit breaker? Camera's all set to go. I hope the others just don't fall out. Got them both in?
102:08:01|CDR|Yes.
102:08:17|LMP|Well, let's hope he's in mode 2.
102:08:33|LMP|Okay, I'm going to get the ASCENT BATS, ON. BATTERY 5, ON; looks good. BATTERY 6, ON; that's good.
102:09:08|CDR|Yes, we've lost it.
102:09:14|LMP|Well, did it go to mode 2? That's where I want it to go.
102:09:22|CDR|No - I can't tell.
102:09:26|LMP|Yes, it's going to mode 2. Hasn't it?
102:09:33|CDR|Yes.
102:09:34|LMP|Yes. There we are. Beautiful.
102:09:38|CDR|Go to AUTO TRACK?
102:09:39|LMP|No, not yet - wait until the light goes out. Did that thing want to - Hey, I didn't know that could do that. You don't hear that, huh? (Laughter)
102:10:01|LMP|Hear that, too, huh?
102:10:06|CDR|Sounds like wind whipping around the trees.
102:10:16|LMP|Okay, AUTO TRACK.

102:11:25|CDR|See that Big Dipper there?
102:11:27|LMP|That's a big out of plane, but I don't know which way it is.
102:11:33|CDR|I believe minus - but they were expecting it.
102:11:36|LMP|Okay, four -
102:11:38|CDR|That's within 7 ... seconds. Okay?
102:11:53|LMP|Okay. These should not be in AUTO, right?
102:11:57|CDR|Yes. Remember that one.
102:12:13|LMP|180, 287, 0. Here goes.
102:12:46|CMP|Give me - -
102:12:47|CDR|You'll get them before we will.
102:12:50|CMP|Ready to give them a status report? DOI?
102:12:54|LMP|Well, I hope it's on the right page.
102:13:24|LMP|Okay, I'm going to get DESCENT QUANTITY, ON, ... ON.
102:14:19|CDR|Okay, you want to give it - Okay, we've lost it. In AUTO now.
102:14:42|LMP|... RANGE RATE.
102:14:59|CDR|How about that?
102:30:47|CDR|VERB 77 and a VERB 62.
102:31:04|LMP|Okay, sequence camera coming on.
102:31:22|CDR|Should be a little ...
102:31:43|LMP|Roger. I think I've got you on high gain now.
102:31:47|CDR|Okay. Hear anything about that?
102:32:02|CDR|Say again the angles, though.
102:32:04|LMP|I'll set them in to use them before we yaw around.
102:32:15|LMP|Copy.
102:32:19|CDR|Okay. What else is left to do here?
102:32:22|LMP|ENGINE ARM, DESCENT. 40 seconds.

102:33:34|CDR|Good. Okay.
102:33:42|LMP|PGNS holding.
102:33:59|LMP|Okay, we're reading your relay to us, Mike? I'll leave it in SLEW. Relay it to us. See if they got me now; I got good signal strength on SLEW.
102:34:21|LMP|Okay, rate of descent looks good.
102:34:27|LMP|Roger. Copy.
102:34:44|LMP|Copy.
102:34:49|CDR|Okay. Coming up on 2 minutes; going good. AGS's good?
102:34:57|LMP|AGS and PGNS agree very closely.
102:34:59|CDR|RCS is good; no flag. DPS pressure is good. 1 minute.
102:35:11|LMP|30 feet per second. Light's on. Altitude's a little high.
102:35:21|CDR|Okay, we want a 10. Let's get - You want to get rid of this radar?
102:35:30|LMP|Yes.
102:35:31|CDR|To SLEW?
102:35:32|LMP|SLEW.
102:35:43|LMP|Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation in the - AC voltage now. Just the meter, maybe, huh?
102:36:03|CDR|Okay, we went by the 3-minute point early. A little off.
102:36:11|LMP|Rate of descent looks real good. Altitude – right about on.
102:36:16|CDR|Our position checks downrange show us to be a little off. AGS - AGS is showing about 2-feet-per-second greater rate of descent.
102:36:34|CDR|MARK.
102:36:35|CDR|Show us to be about - Stand by. Maybe have to stop that.
102:36:41|LMP|Altitude rate looks right down the groove.
102:36:44|CDR|Roger. About 2 seconds off - rolling over.
102:36:54|CDR|Okay, now watch that signal strength because -
102:36:58|LMP|Yes, I think it's going to drop.
102:37:01|CDR|Boy, I tell you, this is much harder to do than it was -
102:37:09|LMP|Keep it going.
102:37:16|LMP|Houston, before we leave you, the ED BATS are GO at 4 minutes.
102:37:28|LMP|Roger.
102:37:44|CDR|How you look over there? Okay?
102:38:02|LMP|Okay. You got good lockon.

102:38:06|LMP|Yes. Altitude light's out.
102:38:08|CDR|Okay.
102:38:12|LMP|DELTA-H is minus 2900. We got the earth right out our front window.
102:38:20|CDR|Sure enough.
102:38:22|LMP|Houston, you're looking at our DELTA-H. Program alarm.
102:38:29|CDR|1202; 1202.
102:38:40|CDR|What is it?
102:38:42|LMP|That's in core ...
102:38:46|CDR|Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.
102:38:57|LMP|Roger. 330. Okay, looks like about 820. Roger. Copy. 6 foot ...
102:39:12|LMP|Same alarm and it appears to come up when we have a 16 68 up.
102:39:19|CDR|Were we - were - was it coming down?
102:39:22|LMP|Yes, it's coming down beautifully.
102:39:26|CDR|Roger; it looks good now.
102:39:32|LMP|THROTTLE, DOWN.
102:39:33|CDR|THROTTLE, DOWN, on time.
102:39:35|LMP|You can feel it in here when the throttle's down; better than the simulator.
102:39:46|LMP|AGS and PGNS look real close.
102:39:48|CDR|Okay. No flags. RCS is GO; DPS is GO; pressure is - okay.
102:40:11|LMP|Okay, I'm still on SLEW, so we may tend to lose as we gradually pitch over; let me try AUTO again now, and see what happens. Okay, looks like it's holding.
102:40:25|CDR|Okay. 07:30 coming up. Should be ...
102:40:36|LMP|...
102:40:45|CDR|And I have the window. I have that - view – out the window - Going to ...
102:40:56|CDR|Coming up on 8 minutes.

104:35:45|LMP|Roger. Couldn't have had better treatment from all of you back there.
104:40:55|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?
104:41:02|CMP|Roger.
104:41:44|CMP|Yes, stand by 1, Charlie, for the next ...
104:41:56|CMP|Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see them. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.
104:42:12|CMP|It looks like a nice area, though.
104:42:46|CMP|Houston, Columbia. I say again: I did not see them. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked out a tiny crater in that area and marked on it, so that I'll be able to have repeatable data, but I was still unable to see them.
106:36:14|CMP|Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here on - AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock; the other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.
106:38:40|CMP|Roger, Houston. Columbia ... up. I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time, hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
106:39:17|CMP|It's going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see them.
106:40:26|CMP|Go ahead.
106:40:57|CMP|Stand by 1.
106:49:03|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:49:21|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:50:09|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Over.
106:53:21|CMP|Okay.
107:05:13|CMP|Houston, Columbia on the high gain.
107:05:23|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Bruce. What's new?
107:05:39|CMP|Ready to copy.
109:19:44|CMP|Columbia.
110:08:54|CMP|Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.
110:09:01|CMP|I'm reading you loud and clear. How's it going?
111:18:29|CMP|Columbia. Roger.
111:18:49|CMP|Negative that.
112:05:58|CMP|Houston, Columbia on ... How do you read?
112:06:10|CMP|Roger; Columbia OMNI Charlie. How do you read?
112:06:34|CMP|Hallelujah.
112:06:57|CMP|Roger, understand. You want a option 1 - P52, option 1?
112:09:09|CMP|P52.
112:14:51|CMP|Roger, Houston. Columbia's reading you.
112:15:20|CMP|Roger. Stand by.
112:15:46|CMP|Ready to copy.
112:17:37|CMP|Houston, Columbia.
112:18:07|CMP|Negative, Bruce. Just give me your latitude - longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares. Never mind the other; you're broken up.
112:18:28|CMP|Well, that is, if you have the new information; otherwise, I'll just use the old numbers.
112:18:37|CMP|Okay.
112:22:17|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?
112:22:31|CMP|Roger. Have you got the new coordinates for me?
112:23:13|CMP|Roger. Thank you.
112:23:43|CMP|Okay.
112:23:56|CMP|Okay. I read back plus 00692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?
112:24:36|CMP|Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.
112:25:38|CMP|Roger.
112:25:51|CMP|Okay.
112:33:57|CMP|Houston, Columbia ...
112:34:10|CMP|Roger. I can't see them.
112:34:21|CMP|Roger. ...
112:34:43|CMP|Roger. I need a very precise position because I can only do a decent Job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.
112:35:10|CMP|Roger. How's the fuel coming?
112:35:29|CMP|Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a ...
123:08:00|CDR|Thank you kindly, Jim.
123:08:06|CDR|Glad to have all you big roomful of people looking over our shoulder.
123:55:17|CMP|Houston, Columbia on OMNI D, Delta. Over.
123:55:33|CMP|Go ahead.
124:16:24|LMP|BAT 2 and 4 coming OFF.
124:16:29|CDR|Okay, OFF.

124:20:56|LMP|Okay, MASTER ARM, ON?
124:20:59|CDR|MASTER ARM is ON.
124:21:14|CDR|At 5 seconds, I'm going to get ABORT STAGE and ENGINE ARM. When I get it, proceed.
124:21:18|LMP|Right.
124:21:20|CDR|...
124:21:26|LMP|...?
124:21:27|CDR|Yes.

124:22:01|CDR|We're off; look at that stuff go all over the place.
124:22:05|LMP|Look at that shadow. Beautifull 26 - 36 feet per second up - -
124:22:10|CDR|The Eagle is - -
124:22:11|LMP|- - Be advised of the pitchover - -
124:22:12|CDR|- - pitching over. BALANCE COUPLE, OFF.
124:22:16|LMP|BALANCE COUPLE, OFF. Very quiet ride. There's that ... sticking out now.
124:22:25|CDR|... See if you can see the - Cat's Paw.
124:22:35|CDR|It's all the way out in front of us in that -
124:22:46|LMP|Roger. Can't see it.
124:22:52|CDR|Do you see the Cat's Paw?
124:22:53|LMP|No.
124:23:03|LMP|This might be it.
124:23:08|CDR|Roger. Yes, I think it is.
124:23:18|LMP|It's a very quiet ride, just a little bit of slow wallowing back and forth - not very much thruster activity.
124:23:35|LMP|700, 150 up; beautiful. 9000. PGNS and AGS agree within a foot per second.
124:23:58|CDR|Pressures are good.
124:24:03|LMP|2 minutes the time; 170 is beautiful, 14 000.
124:24:12|LMP|Within a foot per second again, AGS to PGNS.
124:24:30|LMP|S-band looks like it's holding good - 1500, 182.
124:25:05|CDR|Roger.
124:25:15|LMP|Right on H-dot. Coming up here - -
124:25:19|CDR|Looks like the velocity is sort of - -

124:26:28|CDR|Coming up on Schmidt here pretty soon, huh?
124:26:32|LMP|02:40 to go.
124:26:52|CDR|Everything's fine. 
124:26:54|LMP|Okay, there's Ritter out there. See him, there it is, right there - and there's Schmidt. Man, that's impressive looking, isn't it?
124:27:03|CDR|I can't see it. Oh, yes, now I can just get a glimpse.
124:27:09|LMP|5 minutes, 33 - G&N, 54 -
124:27:15|CDR|Looking good here. It's a spectacular ride.

124:29:00|LMP|350 to go. Stand by on the ENGINE ARM.
124:29:11|CDR|Okay, I'm getting ready for ARM, OFF.
124:29:13|LMP|Ready?
124:29:14|CDR|ARM, OFF.
124:29:15|LMP|OFF. 50 -
124:29:16|CDR|LMP
124:29:21|LMP|We got 5337.3 and 32.8 feet per second, 60 666.
124:29:33|CDR|... up?
124:29:34|LMP|And we got - we got our residuals.
124:29:39|CDR|Okay - take those out, right?
124:29:43|LMP|Yes, take -
124:29:51|CDR|...
124:30:12|LMP|We're working on it.
124:30:39|CDR|I can't check that - residual.
124:30:42|LMP|That's good.
124:30:52|LMP|Okay, that sounds a little - little on the high side.
124:30:57|CDR|Okay.
124:30:58|LMP|Okay, Houston, we show 47.3 by 9.5.
124:31:12|LMP|The AGS has 9.5 - 46.6.
124:31:25|CDR|Okay.
124:31:33|CDR|...
124:31:51|LMP|Roger.
124:32:16|LMP|You want to try ...?
124:32:20|CDR|Yes.
124:32:23|LMP|Circuit breakers in - or do you want to go to align?
124:32:28|CDR|Maybe we'd better get an alignment - ...
124:32:31|LMP|Okay. ...
124:32:40|CDR|Yes.
124:32:52|CDR|Roger, Houston. The Eagle is back in orbit, having left Tranquility Base and leaving behind a replica from our Apollo 11 patch and the olive branch.
124:33:24|CDR|We had a lot of help down there.
124:33:27|LMP|We're going to have to have our rendezvous radar circuit breakers in anyway to get onto your link.
124:33:30|CDR|Yes.
124:33:45|LMP|Okay.
124:34:05|CDR|Okay.
124:34:09|LMP|INVERTER 2, INVERTER 1, circuit breaker open?
124:34:11|CDR|I got INVERTER 1.
124:34:28|LMP|Close the AOT LAMP circuit breaker -
124:34:44|CDR|Going to TRACK here.
124:34:50|LMP|Yes.
124:34:52|CDR|That right?
124:34:53|LMP|Right.
124:35:19|CDR|You know, I didn't see a lot of dust in the cockpit, did you?
124:35:22|LMP|No, there was a fair amount. What did you get, 283?
124:35:31|CDR|Yes.
125:06:58|LMP|...
125:07:08|CDR|Okay.
125:07:39|CDR|No. We'll wait until CDH.
125:08:17|CDR|Okay, thank you.
125:08:37|CDR|Okay.
125:09:31|CDR|No, I didn't; go ahead, Mike.
125:09:39|CDR|I think we are now, finally, and I think I have you in sight.
125:09:57|CDR|We have 51 5.
125:10:19|CDR|Well, the ground's got 51 5, and we got 51 5. Yes. First time we've ever agreed on anything.
125:10:41|LMP|Want these ... first?
125:10:43|CDR|Not yet.
125:10:45|LMP|I don't know why.
125:11:17|LMP|I had to turn my S-band off so I could hear him - my S-band switch on the audio panel. Woo-woo!
125:11:31|CDR|Yes, that works good.
125:11:51|LMP|Not at this point, no.
125:12:42|CDR|Okay.
125:13:11|LMP|... Hey, Mike, how do you read me?
125:13:24|LMP|Okay, let's go to B DATA on your command.
125:13:59|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.
125:14:06|LMP|Loud and clear.
125:14:10|LMP|Affirmative; we're at the burn attitude, too.
125:15:10|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. When you get a chance, could you give me the - the CSI P76 pad and your NOUN 84 and your NOUN 33?
125:15:21|LMP|Yes, we'll do that in a minute.
125:15:25|CMP|Alright.
125:15:50|LMP|Okay, Mike, you want the burn time and the NOUN 81; is that right?
125:16:00|LMP|Okay, the burn time is 125:19:34.7, and the burn is 51.5, zero, and zero.
125:16:16|CMP|Okay, I understand. Plus 51.5, zeros, and zeros, and you're using 125:19:34.70. Thank you kindly.
125:18:45|CMP|I'm in maneuver attitude, all set to burn if necessary. I've got about 45 minutes to TIG - 45 seconds to TIG.
125:18:51|LMP|Okay.
125:19:46|LMP|We're burning, Mike.
125:21:36|LMP|Burn complete, Mike.
125:21:39|CMP|Good show.
125:22:59|LMP|Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58. Over.
125:23:12|CMP|Roger; copy. CDH, 126:17:45.58.
125:23:21|LMP|Affirmative.
125:28:33|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. I have you in an orbit 49.5 by 46.1.
125:28:43|LMP|Okay, thank you.
125:29:09|CMP|Eagle, Columbia. I'd like to go back to VHF RANGING configuration, please, on your mark.
125:29:15|LMP|Roger. On my mark -
125:29:17|LMP|MARK, VHF RANGING.
125:30:37|LMP|...
125:30:40|CDR|Well, which way did I go?
125:30:42|LMP|... out of plane.
125:30:45|CDR|What?
125:30:46|LMP|Did you hear that?
125:30:57|LMP|Why you don't hear these 3 – 3500-pound rocket engines when you're sitting on them, I'll never know.
125:31:03|CDR|Yes.
125:31:08|LMP|... structure somehow.
125:31:31|LMP|3.5, Neil.
125:32:44|LMP|Woo-woos is on VHF B -
125:32:48|CDR|... B?
125:32:50|LMP|Not on A.
125:32:58|CDR|(Laughter) That's your story, huh?
125:33:25|CDR|That's rugged country.
125:34:15|LMP|Yes, that perigee we're on ...
125:34:20|CDR|... alright, isn't it?
125:34:31|LMP|I got 4 feet forward and I got back 7 ...
125:34:38|CDR|Boy, this water separator sure isn't working worth a durn. Maybe we ought to try the other one - ... water. Oh boy, this thing is just really spitting it.
125:34:53|LMP|I sure do; it's been on - yes, we do - it's been on all the time.
125:35:06|CDR|We should see the tracking light now - That's it - Doesn't look ... but it's not - turned off.
125:35:16|LMP|Okay, let's try and get a Y-dot, or an R-dot, at 30 seconds.
125:35:21|CDR|It'll be the first time we've ever done it.
125:35:30|LMP|No, let me get COMM.
125:35:48|LMP|We're really going to be crying.
125:35:50|CDR|[Simulated crying]
125:35:54|CDR|My - top thruster over here has got a lot of brown holes in it - in the exit nozzle.
125:36:05|CDR|See it?
125:36:06|LMP|Yes.
125:36:13|LMP|You know, these thrusters aren't used much over here. Well, maybe ... or something.
125:36:31|CDR|See it?
125:36:34|LMP|No.
125:36:46|LMP|When we get the sun behind us, we might be able to.
125:37:04|LMP|Hey, I got to recycle. Then after ...
125:37:28|LMP|It's all over me.
125:37:38|LMP|Coming out of that vent back of my neck, isn't it? That where it's coming out?
125:38:44|LMP|Give us the CSI state vector - navigation difference - no updating CSI ...
125:39:02|LMP|Through AGS.
125:39:21|LMP|...
125:39:45|LMP|Thinking about it.
125:39:51|CDR|You going to come up with a solution for us?
125:40:33|CDR|Range rate?
125:40:35|LMP|Range rate.
125:40:45|LMP|A lot of trouble having our ... up.
125:41:08|LMP|Range/range rate is ...
125:41:23|LMP|Yaw, damn it!
125:42:24|CMP|...
125:42:28|CMP|... is up.
125:42:30|LMP|125:47:45.58.
125:42:42|CMP|...
125:43:17|LMP|... feet per second.
125:43:19|CDR|Both tanks were pressurized, weren't they?
125:43:21|LMP|Yes.
125:43:22|CDR|Sure shook them up. I remember that Gene said theirs didn't drop a bit - remember that – when they pressurized? Don't think theirs dropped at all.
125:44:37|LMP|Okay.
125:44:43|CDR|We're getting minus 2.9.
125:44:48|LMP|Going AGS all the way, huh?
125:44:50|CDR|Yes, forget it.
125:44:54|LMP|Get more tracking if we forget.
125:45:01|CDR|No, we'll just - we'll just wait until CDH.
125:46:19|CDR|You got a lot of film left in there?
125:46:23|LMP|About half.
125:46:26|CDR|You could run it some here. Oh, you just – you want to leave some for docking, huh?
125:46:50|CDR|... Got that cockpit all cleaned up so that we got places for all our trash, Mike?
125:47:02|CMP|...
125:47:21|CDR|Yes, we got them all over us - look like chimney sweeps.
125:47:36|CDR|You bet you. Nice to get home.
125:48:06|LMP|... up tracking -
125:48:22|LMP|Got that?
125:48:24|CDR|What do you need?
125:48:27|LMP|That right-angle bracket, the right-angle bracket, need that -
125:48:44|CDR|It's not over here. Well, that's a good day not to throw in some failures. See if we can run the nominal one time.
125:52:58|LMP|CO2.
125:53:12|CDR|I don't think so, Mike, we got to - ...
125:53:24|LMP|... want to go to that - ...
125:53:26|CMP|Stand by for ...
125:53:32|CDR|Right, that's what we've got.
125:53:39|LMP|...
127:02:31|CMP|Coming up on 1 minute to TIG. Neil, how's it looking?
127:02:36|CDR|Pretty good.
127:02:41|LMP|That last out of plane was in the AGS, not the radar.
127:02:45|CMP|Alright.
127:03:05|LMP|...
127:03:07|CDR|Okay.
127:03:47|CDR|Ready to burn?
127:03:48|LMP|Okay.
127:03:50|CDR|We're burning.
127:04:32|CDR|Okay, that's it.
127:04:34|CMP|Burn complete?
127:04:35|CDR|Burn's complete. Did you read? Burn's complete.
127:04:40|CMP|Thank you.
127:04:43|CC|Eagle, Houston. Aft OMNI, LOW BIT RATE, and we'll see you at 127 plus 51.
127:05:07|LMP|Okay, ... ... 5, huh?
127:06:10|CDR|Well - say when ... Oh, wait a minute.
127:06:50|LMP|Chart at 26/7 forward for -
127:06:55|CDR|Pretty reasonable.
127:06:59|LMP|AGS had these residuals after its completion after the burn.
127:07:39|CDR|I can't see you, Michael.
127:07:44|CMP|... moving in at ...
127:07:50|CDR|Okay. I got good radar; I just can't see you.
127:08:03|CMP|...
127:08:49|LMP|Do you think that pressure dropped?
127:08:51|CDR|Yes.
127:08:54|LMP|It doesn't show up in the ... books. I don't see any reason why we don't take them all back. All that we've got - -
127:09:00|CDR|All got data.
127:09:02|LMP|We all got something ...
127:10:20|LMP|Okay, you try getting it - ...?
127:10:25|CDR|No, I haven't been; do you want me to?
127:10:27|LMP|No, I got to keep the chart.
127:10:58|CDR|... can take this update for them.
127:12:00|LMP|On the track about, huh?
127:12:21|LMP|Boy, my shoulders sure hurt.
127:12:23|CDR|Mine are, too.
127:12:26|LMP|Last night I couldn't get this far from the ...
127:12:30|CDR|I was the same way.
127:13:00|LMP|Use all the green tape, did you?
127:14:31|CDR|I got it in sight now, Mike.
127:14:34|CMP|...
127:15:33|LMP|...
127:15:39|CDR|Okay.
127:16:08|SC|(Yawn)
127:16:12|CMP|...
127:16:18|LMP|Yes, so do we.
127:16:19|CDR|A hundred and what?
127:16:33|CMP|...
127:16:37|LMP|Okay, NOUN 81, minus 0, plus 0.4, plus 0.9.
127:16:49|CMP|And now, plus 0.4, plus 0.9. ...
127:16:58|LMP|And 15 minutes after TPI, I've got - -
127:17:03|CMP|...
127:17:35|CDR|M-1.
127:17:36|LMP|...
127:17:53|LMP|... your burn's a little late.
127:18:04|CDR|... be burning - ...
127:18:12|LMP|Okay, ... the ... on? There it is.
127:18:28|LMP|Neil, I guarantee you that the burn is precise, okay?
127:18:31|CDR|...
127:18:33|LMP|Good.
127:18:39|CMP|... good burn ...
127:18:43|CDR|No, it's not going to be late. Maybe 5 seconds.
127:19:17|CDR|Burn complete.
127:19:19|CMP|Thank you.
127:20:13|CDR|Well, it's all over but the docking.
127:20:26|CDR|Check the start out there.
127:20:32|LMP|Okay.
127:20:41|CDR|...
127:20:51|LMP|You still got him?
127:20:55|CDR|Yes. I probably won't when the sun gets in my telescope.
127:21:06|LMP|... ... hold the ...
127:21:11|CMP|Now I can't see - -
127:21:13|CDR|The what?
127:21:14|LMP|Won't hold the ...
127:21:19|CMP|... going right down the ... and it sure has been nice.
127:21:23|CDR|Okay. I just got sight of you in the sunlight here.
127:21:27|CMP|Okay.
127:21:29|LMP|Oh, I've got him.
127:21:43|LMP|...
127:21:51|CDR|I've got him now, too.
127:22:00|LMP|Sure enough.
127:22:11|CMP|Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.
127:22:15|CDR|That's good.
127:22:19|CMP|...
127:22:27|CDR|You're not confused on which end to dock with, are you?
127:22:34|CMP|...
127:22:58|CDR|Okay, Mike, if there's some data bags around there - I may have one or two in my temporary stowage - why, we may want them in addition to the other regular bags, so we can put some of this data back in it.
127:23:13|CMP|In the data bags?
127:23:16|CDR|Yes, there are a couple of different LM bags that I left in there.
127:23:21|CMP|Okay, well, why don't we ... back over there and ...?
127:23:26|CDR|Right.
127:23:39|CMP|... bring the bag ...
127:23:45|CDR|Could be.
127:23:47|CMP|Alright.
127:24:13|CMP|Okay, ... have a plastic one and a ...
127:24:23|CMP|Bring the ... back.
127:24:40|CDR|I think we'll make it (laughter).
127:24:44|LMP|Don't tell that to poor ..., though (laughter).
127:24:47|CMP|...
127:24:56|CDR|We'll see you at ...
127:25:02|CDR|Okay.
127:25:31|CDR|One of those two bright spots is bound to be Mike.
127:25:36|LMP|How about picking the closest one?
127:25:44|CDR|Good idea.
127:26:17|LMP|... this light?
127:26:21|CDR|Is that alright?
127:26:37|CDR|Okay, at 49 000 feet, we're supposed to be 65 feet per second - our little old chart says. And our LOS rate's supposed to be about O.1; it's about point - -
127:26:51|CMP|...
127:26:55|LMP|Okay.
127:27:08|CMP|...
127:27:16|CDR|Right - that's ...
127:27:26|LMP|12 on here, right?
127:27:29|CDR|Not exactly.
127:27:30|LMP|Not exactly?
127:27:32|CDR|You're a little less. You're 10 seconds less in ... About that ...
127:28:23|CDR|Look's like you're making a high ... on us, Michael.
127:28:27|CMP|Yes, ...
127:29:26|CMP|... let me move in just a ...
127:29:31|CDR|No, we aren't that - confident.
127:30:08|CDR|...?
127:30:12|LMP|We've got about 54.
127:30:47|CDR|You got ... to ...?
127:30:49|LMP|Huh?
127:30:50|CDR|The ...?
127:30:51|LMP|Yes. ...
127:31:05|CDR|Let's try this midcourse out.
127:31:08|LMP|Right. Okay, it's ...
127:31:37|LMP|...
127:31:40|CDR|Is that right, I hope?
127:31:42|LMP|Yes.
127:31:59|CDR|It should be 70.
127:32:25|LMP|Okay, I can see the shape of your vehicle now, Mike.
127:32:42|CDR|Oh, yes - got your high gain in sight; your tracking light - whole vehicle shows. I see that you're pointed at me. Now, you're turning a little bit - great.
127:33:39|CMP|...
127:33:49|CMP|Are you burning yet?
127:33:50|CDR|We're burning.
127:33:51|CMP|...
127:34:15|LMP|Good enough.
127:34:21|CDR|Seems like when you get down to around 110, you just keep chasing him. You put it in – stick it in one axis, and it goes through - out of another, especially when ... stays about the same.
127:34:30|LMP|If it's ..., it's definite.
127:34:43|LMP|Okay, now, let's see; we want to change the DAP - that what we want to do?
127:34:48|CDR|Yes.
127:34:49|CMP|I need a P76 now, Buzz.
127:34:54|LMP|Okay, you got the time for the burn; NOUN 81 was plus 0.1, plus 1.2, plus 0.5.
127:35:05|CMP|...
127:35:23|LMP|... plus ...
127:35:38|CDR|Okay. ... 45 -
127:36:14|CDR|8.2 miles, 40 feet per second.
127:36:26|LMP|You can have your place now.
127:36:49|CMP|...
127:36:52|CDR|Okay.
127:37:01|LMP|Can you see our tracking light, now?
127:37:04|CMP|... but you're in between my sextant and my COAS.
127:38:33|LMP|Where'd you put the ...?
127:38:35|CDR|My what?
127:38:36|LMP|Your ... for ...
127:38:39|CDR|It's in the bottom over ...
127:39:30|CMP|... pick me up ...
127:39:33|CDR|I got you.
127:39:34|CMP|Okay. Don't ... other spacecraft.
127:39:40|LMP|No, I'm not going to lose you, brother.
127:39:49|CMP|What have you got for ...? ... I have 6.8 and 9 miles, ... out. Oh, that checks.
127:40:06|CDR|Got ... up? I thought I made it pretty clear.
127:40:20|LMP|Not as sporty a ... as we thought, huh?
127:40:25|CDR|That wasn't - bad at all; the alignment was - pretty dicey.
127:40:31|LMP|Yes, sir.
127:40:34|CDR|That was just luck (laughter).
127:40:39|LMP|I hope you ...
127:40:49|LMP|I'll be glad to get to the ...
127:40:52|CDR|Yes, but I hate to ...; will you get ...?
127:40:57|LMP|Okay.
127:41:02|CDR|Oh, it'll come off, I guess - ...
127:41:07|LMP|These screws here - -
127:41:08|CDR|Alright, there's a couple of bolts - -
127:41:10|LMP|- - these screws here might do it.
127:41:13|CDR|- - there's a couple of bolts down there that have come loose - if I remember. ... I'llget them.
127:41:21|CMP|I'm slowly closing at 32 feet per second and a mile and a half.
127:41:25|CDR|Okay, I've got a mile and a half and 32-1/2.
127:41:28|CMP|...
127:41:40|LMP|Take ...
127:41:43|CDR|Yes, I guess it'll take us another - 6 minutes or something like that.
127:41:47|LMP|Yes.
127:41:48|CMP|... we got 15 ...
127:41:57|CMP|...
127:42:01|CDR|Okay.
127:42:23|LMP|That's going to hit the braking gate right on the schedule.
127:42:30|CDR|Yes.
127:43:02|CDR|Okay, let's put P47 in.
127:43:22|CDR|I don't know why I lost my - I'm at - oh, did you - you lost your transponder, Mike - I think.
127:43:33|CMP|... pitch up a bit.
127:43:36|CDR|I wish you would.
127:43:43|CMP|I have 0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second, ... look good.
127:43:50|LMP|Okay, ...
127:43:53|CMP|...?
127:43:57|LMP|Okay, we're getting it.
127:43:59|CMP|... -
127:44:12|CMP|Are you ... forward now?
127:44:15|LMP|Yes - yes, we're in good shape, Mike; we're braking.
127:44:17|CMP|Okay.
127:44:52|CMP|...
127:44:53|CDR|Flying all over us.
127:46:13|CDR|Okay, we're about 11 feet a second coming in at you
127:46:17|CMP|...
127:46:43|CMP|That's good. What ... are you in?
127:47:05|LMP|Hope we're not going to get a pitch straight down.
127:47:16|CDR|We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do - ...
127:47:55|CMP|...
127:47:59|CDR|Looks good.
127:49:06|CMP|I'm sure you're going to get ..., I'll tell you that.
127:49:11|CDR|It flies good, though.
127:49:16|CMP|...?
127:49:50|CDR|Okay, now, if I pitch over, I'm going to be looking right into the sun.
127:50:00|CMP|...
127:50:09|LMP|Hope you know how to roll.
127:50:11|CMP|Yes, I do. I ...
127:50:23|LMP|You want to end up with that window – opposite his right window so you don't want to roll right. Right?
127:50:32|CDR|Yes.
127:50:34|LMP|The only trouble is, it's towards - towards 90, isn't it?
127:50:56|LMP|You could - you -
127:50:58|CDR|If I roll 120 - it'll roll left
127:51:06|LMP|90, huh? ... 60?
127:51:21|CDR|Well, why don't I start to roll - -
127:51:24|LMP|Yes, I think if you roll up 60 –
127:51:29|CDR|I'll be looking into his left window when I pitch up.
127:51:32|LMP|I don't think so. If you did it right now you'd - -
127:51:36|CMP|... I got the earth coming up already; it's fantastic!
127:51:40|CDR|Okay, you got me.
127:52:00|CC|Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
127:52:05|CDR|Roger; we're stationkeeping.
127:52:08|CC|Roger.
127:52:24|LMP|Pitch up ... pass right up just a little, you got a better view - bottom side - ... - move back.
127:52:45|CMP|... - that's right.
127:53:08|CDR|Okay. I'm getting about into the right attitude, I think. ...
127:53:18|LMP|Yes.
127:53:21|CDR|That roll's pretty far; I don't know just how much - so that's - Oh, it's going to go BLOCK!
127:53:28|LMP|That's it - going to AGS?
127:53:32|CDR|Yes, ... ATT DEADBAND.
127:54:11|CDR|Okay, Mike, I'll get - try to get in position here, and then you got it.
127:54:18|CMP|Okay.
127:54:37|CDR|How does the roll attitude look?
127:54:41|CMP|...
127:54:47|CDR|Let's see how the DSKY thinks it looks.
127:54:52|CMP|Have you stopped rolling yet?
127:54:54|CDR|I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here, if you like that.
127:54:59|CMP|Need a little bit more. That's the way; keep it going. Need a little more ... That's the way, keep going - go a little bit more - go ahead - go ahead - okay, stop. Okay, I got it now.
127:55:27|LMP|You got the ... in ...?
127:55:36|CDR|Yes. Right there. Okay, ... 1 -
127:55:55|LMP|Well, we might need to at least have a platform ...
127:56:01|CDR|Yes.
127:56:27|CMP|Okay, now, Neil, when you feel us contact, you're going to turn ... seconds, is that right?
127:56:33|LMP|That's right.
127:56:34|CMP|Okay, Buzz.
127:57:12|LMP|We got a platform to make.
127:57:13|CDR|Okay.
127:57:32|CDR|I'm not going to do a thing, Mike; I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.
127:57:38|CMP|Okay.
127:57:55|CDR|I think we ought to be at 4 JETS for this, ... AGS.
127:58:04|LMP|HOLD.
127:58:13|CDR|...
127:58:42|CDR|He's about 15 feet out now.
127:58:45|LMP|Okay, I'd better try out the radar.
127:58:52|CDR|Don't you want to beef up that radar?
127:58:59|LMP|Yes.
127:59:00|CDR|Good.
127:59:06|CDR|Ready to pull the circuit breakers?
127:59:08|LMP|Okay. You ready?
127:59:10|CDR|Yes.
127:59:12|LMP|They're pulled.
127:59:14|CDR|He's 10 feet. About 5 feet, I guess.
127:59:23|CDR|Looks good, Mike.
127:59:35|LMP|Okay, they're pulled.
127:59:39|CDR|Pull it out.
127:59:40|LMP|Okay. Circuit breakers - -
129:04:08|LMP|Now, here are a couple of bags - and I think it's self-explanatory what goes in them.
129:04:14|CDR|Yes.
129:04:18|LMP|... water.
129:04:41|LMP|Now, where are those things?
129:04:44|CDR|They're at the over ...
129:04:55|LMP|Maybe I could slide out of here ...
129:05:20|LMP|Hey, Michael, you all tied up there?
129:05:25|CMP|...
129:05:27|LMP|Get ready for those million-dollar boxes. Got a lot of weight; now, watch it.
129:05:52|CMP|You intend to keep ...?
129:05:57|CDR|Yes.
129:06:14|LMP|That's all your input, are you sure?
129:06:17|CMP|Yes.
129:06:18|LMP|Okay.
129:06:32|LMP|Use what?
129:06:34|CDR|Use lithium hydroxide.
129:07:06|CDR|That thing still doesn't fit. No, they didn't fix it.
129:07:10|LMP|Huh?
129:07:11|CDR|They didn't fix it. I had thought somebody had mentioned it, at least.
129:07:19|LMP|...
129:07:20|CDR|What?
129:07:21|LMP|...
129:07:24|CDR|Get some tape.
129:07:26|LMP|Yes.
129:07:29|CDR|Still got some here?
129:07:30|LMP|Yes.
129:07:31|CMP|...
129:07:35|CDR|Okay.
129:08:54|CDR|Do you want to vacuum off any of those – those ... spills or anything?
129:09:07|LMP|Well, that's ...
129:09:22|CDR|Oh, the tape, I guess.
129:09:25|LMP|Want tape?
129:09:26|CDR|Yes, please.
129:09:27|LMP|Here you are.
129:10:35|LMP|About how many pictures did you take with – the closeup camera?
129:10:39|CDR|I don't know; 30 maybe, 40?
129:10:56|LMP|I hope I took the thing apart correctly.
129:11:03|CDR|Push the cutter bar down first?
129:11:05|LMP|Yes.
129:11:07|CDR|It's all right, then.
129:11:29|CDR|How are you doing?
129:11:32|CMP|Can't hear you.
129:11:33|CDR|(Laughter) Well, that stuff can't ... tell; think of Bobby ...
129:11:42|LMP|Say, you did get a couple of hard ones in there, didn't you?
129:11:46|CDR|Yes.
129:12:15|LMP|I guess we leave this here or do you want to take it up?
129:12:19|CDR|I'd leave that here.
129:12:22|LMP|That might be a little hard to explain.
129:12:24|CDR|Yes.
129:12:42|CMP|Hey, Neil?
129:12:43|CDR|Yes?
129:12:44|CMP|...
129:12:53|CDR|Okay.
129:12:54|CMP|... get rid of this ...
129:12:58|CDR|Okay. If you want to have a look at what the moon looks like, you can open that up and look. Don't open the bag, though.
129:13:26|CMP|...
129:13:29|CDR|You'd never have guessed, huh? (Laughter)
129:14:00|CDR|What did you do with that checklist?
129:14:03|LMP|It's back yonder.
129:14:05|CDR|What?
129:14:07|LMP|It's behind the hatch.
129:14:17|CMP|What was that bag ...?
129:14:20|CDR|Contingency sample.
129:14:23|CMP|Rock?
129:14:25|CDR|Yes, there's some rocks in it, too. You can feel them, but you can't see them; they're covered with that - graphite.
129:14:39|CMP|... compared to -
129:14:45|CDR|Looks like powdered graphite to me.
129:14:46|LMP|Say, you got a screwdriver, Mike?
129:14:48|CMP|Yes.
129:14:50|LMP|Yes?
129:14:51|CMP|Yes, I guess I have; just a second.
129:14:53|CDR|You know, that - that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back – LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself; we'll have to figure something out for it.
129:15:16|LMP|Ouch! Alright, here's your checklist.
129:16:36|LMP|You vacuum all this stuff?
129:16:41|CDR|Which?
129:16:42|LMP|Gloves, lunar stuff?
129:16:46|CDR|...
129:17:05|LMP|Okay. It looks to me like - what we're going to do is vacuum you out and get you out of here. I'll - throw the switches down there.
129:17:16|CDR|How about the data bag?
129:17:18|LMP|No, I need this bag.
129:17:20|CDR|Well, I've got one here. I'll go try to get some more - when I go over. Okay?
129:17:26|LMP|Okay. Give me the vacuum tube.
129:17:38|CDR|Let me get my back to you first.
129:19:02|LMP|Need a PPK.
129:19:05|CDR|Huh? I guess they're in here. PPK's?
129:19:20|LMP|I guess they're over here.
129:19:51|CDR|..., you know? (Laughter)
129:19:54|LMP|Get your circuit breakers pushed, AUDIO control circuit breakers?
129:20:06|CMP|...
129:21:13|CMP|How are you doing?
129:21:16|LMP|It's filthy.
129:21:18|CMP|Does all this stuff come in here?
129:22:09|CDR|Well, I guess that ought to do it.
129:22:20|LMP|Okay.
129:26:13|CDR|...
129:26:14|LMP|Yes.
129:26:15|CDR|...
129:26:17|LMP|Just a minute.
129:26:36|LMP|Say, I need some of those data books.
129:27:59|LMP|Where did you put the book? Where did you put the first one? In here? Okay.
129:28:28|CDR|...
129:28:33|LMP|No, we can leave those two here. No, I don't want either of those two. No, I think the others might be -
129:28:55|CDR|... we leave these bags here.
129:28:59|LMP|Okay.
129:29:18|LMP|Hey, have you been over it, Mike?
129:29:21|CMP|... really ...
129:29:31|LMP|How about calling them and asking them for – if those angles are still good? Right at lock-lock with them?
129:29:43|CMP|... last time ...
129:29:47|LMP|Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
131:00:26|CC|...
131:00:34|LMP|It's not, but I'll get it off.
131:00:36|CDR|Okay.
131:00:41|CC|Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar - -
131:00:48|LMP|What do you do with it?
131:00:49|CC|- - and that was the only theory that we had - it looked like it was a good one.
131:00:52|LMP|Hey - what do you do with it?
131:00:54|CMP|Just turn it down to off.
131:00:56|LMP|This goes off - -
131:00:57|CMP|No, no, no, no, that's not the one - it's this switch right next to that IMU - -
131:01:00|LMP|Oh.
131:01:01|CMP|- - Buzz. Okay, that one, just turn it to – turn it to position 1 - extreme left; that one. There you go. Thank you.
131:01:18|LMP|I thought you were going to be doing VHF RANGING on the darn thing because we had it set up for - VHF ...
131:01:24|CMP|I don't know where ... other than that.
131:01:31|LMP|That was to - -
131:01:35|CMP|You ought to check the flight plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue. It says I remove my hatch, and then I notify you that you're clear to open your hatch.
131:01:49|CMP|Huh?
131:01:58|LMP|Oh, no.
131:01:59|CMP|So, that's just the contingency.
131:02:04|LMP|No, negative.
131:02:06|CMP|That's the contingency.
131:02:08|LMP|We move the drogue there. ...
131:02:11|CMP|We've got to reach down and grab that extension handle and all that good stuff.
131:02:26|LMP|That was alright, we understand.
131:02:47|CDR|Yes.
131:03:09|CMP|Damn! My ears hurt from wearing this thing.
131:03:15|LMP|How are the earpieces - inside ...
131:03:22|CMP|...
131:03:24|LMP|...
131:03:26|CMP|Yes, I hate those damn ...
131:03:28|LMP|Yes, they're not - ...
131:03:32|CDR|Yes. I believe - Did you hear any noise during - you didn't hear any noise during descent, did you? ...
131:03:38|CMP|...
131:03:39|CDR|How about during lift-off?
131:03:41|CMP|...
131:03:46|CMP|How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?
131:03:48|LMP|Well, there was a little - little blast – then we started moving; then we could see all those - -
131:03:56|CMP|... were you very stable; I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?
131:04:01|LMP|- - The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by ... - it was about - at lift-off - maybe - half a g or two-thirds of a g.
131:04:25|CMP|Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.
131:04:38|LMP|Yes it was - -
131:04:43|CMP|But it's pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn't really come up and engulf you, huh?
131:04:48|LMP|All the stuff looks like very light tan and gray, you know, that's - that's the color of it. When you get right up there to it, when you see it, why that isn't the color at all.
131:05:01|CMP|Dark - battleship gray, isn't it?
131:05:05|LMP|Maybe not - I don't know - -
131:05:08|CMP|Well, what kind of - -
131:05:09|LMP|- - what stuck to the spacecraft, I think you can see afterwards - -
131:05:12|CMP|What do you think it is from the - geology standpoint, is it basalt dust?
131:05:19|CDR|...
131:05:21|CMP|Well, do the rocks - do the rocks all look the same? They're different - good, great; I'm glad to hear it.
131:05:28|LMP|There's really a tremendous -
131:05:42|LMP|Little sparkly stuff; quite a bit of it all over.
131:05:46|CMP|I'll be damned; I'm glad - I'm glad it wasn't just - -
131:05:48|MS|...
131:05:50|LMP|Yes, is that right?
131:05:59|CMP|Luckily, you were able to get a little bit of everything. I mean, were the rocks - I mean, how did you - did you go around and - just pick up rocks, put them in - in - -
131:06:08|LMP|We were kind of rushed, if that's what you mean.
131:06:15|CMP|Yes.
131:06:24|CDR|...
131:06:25|CMP|Great, great. Yes, it's - beautiful. Man, that's beautiful. It doesn't make a dip whether ... and all that, I mean you know, they mapped the area and all that - -
131:06:38|LMP|Eventually, it does - -
131:06:40|CMP|Huh?
131:06:41|LMP|Well, eventually, it does - it shows the ... - you can see those - ...
131:06:54|CMP|That's great; fantastic! That'll keep those geologists jumping for years.
131:07:00|LMP|Yes, you got to keep ... No, that's right, you got a 6-foot pole, you just stick ... - -
131:07:07|CMP|Sort of like wet sand - -
131:07:08|LMP|- - about that far.
131:07:09|CMP|Is that right? I don't know. I'm inclined to ...
131:07:17|CDR|... Is this yours?
131:07:59|CMP|You yawed right 13 degrees? What's nominal?
131:08:05|CDR|Yaw left 13 degrees.
131:08:08|CMP|Ah so, ah so.
131:08:32|CDR|I guess the main thing on this stowage is to make sure it's reasonable for the g's we'll get during TEI and sometime on the way home we can get everything all squared away for ...
131:08:46|CMP|No, I'm in no rush. Go ahead - go ahead and get everything all packed away; I hate to have – a couple of suits out. If you want to air it for a while, go ahead and get the hose to it, and - I'm in no rush. I'll take this thing off after you guys are done there.
131:09:20|CDR|...
131:09:30|CMP|Yes. Is that right?
131:09:44|CMP|You finally got it level, huh? What was that thing that you said it was supposed to be concave but it was convex?
131:09:50|LMP|...
131:09:53|CMP|Yes, yes.
131:10:01|LMP|... looking down there ... sure looked like it was convex ... Neil walked back a little later and it was right smack in the middle ... - -
131:10:29|CMP|But there's all different kinds of rocks, huh, or at least several different kinds? Well, how - -
131:10:32|LMP|- - ...
131:10:41|CMP|Well, did - when you look - when you're walking around or just looking out the window of the LM, did it appear very homogeneous? Everything sort of the same color and all, or did it look ...?
131:10:56|LMP|...
131:10:58|CMP|It's that dark battleship gray like?
131:11:01|LMP|When you looked down sun, it's very tan, very tan.
131:11:03|CDR|...
131:11:14|CMP|When you looked down sun, it looks almost white, just a reflection from the sun.
131:11:21|LMP|Well, ... as it goes out ... while on earth it gets ... in the atmosphere ... - -
131:11:27|CMP|Yes.
131:11:28|LMP|- - ... that might be indicative of why ... - -
131:11:51|CMP|Yes.
131:12:03|CMP|Neil, when you get a hand, would you push that little goddam valve down to DUMP? Never mind, never mind.
131:12:14|CDR|... be sure and get the right one ... - -
131:12:20|CMP|It's the lower valve on the lower panel – lower left; that guy right there. Yes, that guy right there; put him down to DUMP. Dump's easy, fine; set the clock.
131:13:08|CDR|...
131:13:10|LMP|Here's one.
131:13:12|CMP|... for the hoses? Well, check the ends of the hoses.
131:13:22|CMP|Well, why don't you leave the vacuum cleaner; I think you just got ... now the other one - -
131:13:29|LMP|No, this one's got ...
131:13:31|CDR|Okay. Now the one I got is for my hose over here which doesn't have -
131:13:55|CMP|How big are the rocks that you just scurried around and picked up with the tongs? Good gravy! Beautiful! Just crack those guys open and get a - you know, virgin interior of them in a vacuum, and they'll have a ball. ...
131:14:19|CMP|Hey, the Velcro - the Velcro around them sort of ...
131:14:35|CMP|Huh?
131:14:37|CDR|I said, this is my field geology ...
131:14:40|CMP|Right.
131:14:49|CDR|...
131:15:10|CMP|We could move - we could move that bag - it's no big thing, we can move the bag. Don't worry about it; we're going to leave it this way for TEI, right? Might as well.
131:15:28|CDR|...
131:15:32|CMP|Good day, I don't know. It's - I tell you, it's not a bad way to live, with that couch in there - I sort of - oh, yes, I agree; we can put two up and one down - ...
131:15:53|LMP|...
131:16:08|CMP|Yes, we could put the couch up now if you want to do that.
131:16:14|LMP|Okay.
131:16:15|CMP|Yes. Maybe it - maybe it would make more sense to put the couch up now. Why don't you let me wrestle with the couch before we do anything more to this damn poor L-shaped bag?
131:16:26|LMP|...
131:16:29|CMP|Alright. And we're - we're LOS here for a while anyway, 131 -
131:16:54|CMP|Here's about where we are, ... Yes, this is the handiest little thing you've ever seen. ... goes right in the helmet side, won't come out, and you can grab hold of anything you want, and there it is, it won't ...
131:17:08|LMP|(Laughter) ...
131:17:42|SC|(Yawn)
131:20:23|CMP|... all this little stuff ...
131:21:42|LMP|... is this optional - sort of - ...? Huh?
131:21:54|CMP|No, optional ...
131:22:11|CMP|No, no, this is - used for the intervalometer?
131:22:17|LMP|...
131:24:27|CDR|... might have some layers on the wall of that crater. It just occurred to me that - that's got to be the result of ... of some sort ...
131:28:02|CDR|... is looking good.
131:28:05|LMP|Think so.
131:28:12|CDR|A little more.
131:28:26|CMP|You got to do what, Neil?
131:29:27|CDR|I don't think it's harder to ... than it is – at orbital speeds. ... There just isn't any way really of ... altitude - or the size of this thing.
131:29:59|CMP|We're in INERTIAL, aren't we?
131:30:10|CDR|No, you want to go to INERTIAL?
131:34:35|CMP|I wonder if Neil has made any preparations?
131:35:29|CDR|What's your altitude?
131:35:34|CMP|...
131:35:52|CDR|I guess we could put - ... to ...
131:37:25|LMP|Hey, Neil, I think this - this does have something ...
131:37:30|CDR|Alright.
131:37:35|LMP|... Now it's on the other side. No, down, down ...
131:39:18|LMP|What did you have on ...?
131:39:24|CMP|No, that side. Yes, it was down to 3. He called 30 seconds at one time.
131:39:32|LMP|Yes, ...
131:39:38|CMP|Yes, he called 60 seconds; then I heard him call 30 seconds.
131:40:15|CMP|Yes.
131:40:16|LMP|... I got it, thank you.
131:40:21|CMP|Well, it's held under that forward-velocity unit.
131:40:46|CMP|How's that?
131:41:05|CMP|With the ..., I don't see how you can -
131:41:19|CDR|Leaving on your ... in here?
131:41:26|CMP|I think - you had that same pair on all the time.
131:41:57|CDR|Is that the ... - sitting there?
131:42:05|CMP|Yes, here it is.
131:42:06|CDR|Let me put it down here. Bring it on down. Over here. Put them all in one place.
131:42:30|CDR|You ready for your underwear? Mike - you ready for your underwear? You ready for your underwear?
131:42:43|CMP|Just a minute; yes.
131:42:54|LMP|... - put our - LCG.
131:42:59|CDR|Yes.
131:43:10|CMP|Somehow we'll figure a way to ...
131:45:22|CDR|2 feet per second.
131:45:46|LMP|You didn't maintain that 3-1/2 feet per second down there.
131:45:51|CDR|(Laughing)
131:45:56|LMP|Well, I hope - I hope they have the data that shows just what we did have at contact when they can get photographs ... all the film we got.
131:46:14|CDR|Yes.
131:46:19|LMP|Well, I really couldn't put the ... no place, not that I'm sure of it, but my light came on, why, ... hit.
131:47:18|CDR|Yes, that's sure - the way that thing was working - the way that thing was working and stayed locked on all the way down - Gees, it was a beautiful thing.
131:47:44|CDR|You mean you didn't ...?
131:47:53|LMP|Getting all the damn alarms.
131:48:06|LMP|Boy, I thought for a while there that some of those might get a little ... - ... I'd reset the program alarm in time for a ... out of there.
132:59:10|CMP|Will that one do? ...
132:59:48|LMP|Are you staying in this inertial attitude? Let's just leave it in REACQ then; it works just like a charm.
132:59:55|CMP|Yes, that's right.
133:00:09|CDR|How about that?
133:00:55|CDR|Beautiful.
133:00:59|CMP|405 and 404 - What's the matter with it? (Laughter)
133:01:02|LMP|403 I think we ...
133:01:09|CMP|... alignment, oops, I got 404 again.
133:01:55|CMP|How about that, wise asses! Huh?
133:01:58|LMP|You had a - you had to work though, didn't you?
133:03:08|CMP|... O2 fuel cell's ....
133:03:17|CDR|This is not dumping.
133:03:19|CMP|I figured that.
133:03:25|CDR|Did you try the other line?
133:03:26|CMP|Well - no, I haven't tried a whole number of alternatives. In fact, number 1 is not dumping. My guess would be that it's something to do with this connection in the UCD or something like that. When you try to dump your ... regular urine bag, ... It's so goddam smelly, I hate to grab it and dick around with it, but I guess I got to.
133:03:47|CDR|Not entirely. I think I'd rather stick around ...
133:04:40|CDR|...
133:05:36|LMP|How long does it take to warm up this thing? 3 hours?
133:05:38|CMP|...
133:05:46|CDR|What state vector is in the LM slot? The LM?
133:05:54|LMP|... minus a few feet per second. ...
133:05:59|CDR|Well, we got something in the LM slot ...
133:06:03|CMP|Well, that's just an old vectors, because I never did VERB 66, I don't think, after ...
133:06:32|LMP|We got 22 feet per second. Almost have to be LM - previous to the SEP burn.
133:10:11|CDR|Well, when it gets to be light, we got to ...
133:10:19|LMP|Well, we probably ought to - ... TPI.
133:10:27|CMP|Yes, the maneuver ... right amount of ...
133:11:24|CDR|... give me a waste bag ....
133:11:31|CMP|Yes, just ... a lot ... there.
133:12:17|CMP|It was back here.
133:12:19|LMP|Yes.
133:13:03|CMP|Who took the roll of tape?
133:13:08|CDR|Isn't it in its place? Closet?
133:13:10|CMP|No, no, it's not in there. It doesn't have that closet anymore. The last I saw it, it was up on the MDC. I gave it - I handed it to one of you guys to -
133:13:17|LMP|Yes, I stuck it someplace.
133:13:25|CMP|Let's invent a new home for it because that old home is full of that smelly old urine bag.
133:13:34|CDR|The floodlight isn't - hasn't even made the bottom of the package warm yet, fellows.
133:13:39|LMP|Well, when it goes up there, we'll have to put it up here.
133:17:10|CMP|I got the tape - right underneath your couch. Okay?
133:17:19|LMP|Alright.
133:17:25|CMP|Okay, we need a new home for the tape. Anybody got any good suggestions?
133:17:36|CMP|Okay?
133:17:39|LMP|Alright.
133:18:02|CMP|We believed you, though.
133:19:29|CMP|(Yawn)
133:19:40|CDR|...
133:20:05|LMP|Go ahead.
133:21:25|CDR|I think we had a ...
133:21:44|CDR|Not a burn ...
133:21:55|CMP|Oh, God, why ... (laughter) ...
133:22:10|CDR|... but right now, I am for a nice beer.
133:22:54|CDR|..., some water here. Mike, do you remember trying to get water into a grapefruit-pineapple drink?
133:23:05|CMP|No, don't do it.
133:23:06|CDR|Yes.
133:23:07|CMP|Don't do it.
133:23:13|LMP|Couldn't get it in, huh?
133:23:15|CDR|No.
133:23:51|CMP|..., Buzz?
133:23:59|LMP|... some of that.
133:24:59|CMP|There's a piece of that great bread that has mold all over it.
133:26:45|LMP|You got the flight plan?
133:26:51|CDR|...
133:27:05|LMP|...
133:27:08|CMP|Probably are. I purged them this morning when I woke up, Buzz. Probably did the hydrogen as well.
133:27:16|LMP|47, 32, 47?
133:33:37|CMP|That was quite a wild gyration for docking.
133:33:40|LMP|It was.
133:33:42|CMP|Son-of-a-bitching - -
133:33:43|LMP|You did a pretty good ...
133:33:49|CMP|If I'd known how it was going to develop, I wouldn't have gone as far with the bottle as I did. I was in the habit of it, you know, as soon as contact is made, I look at it. It looks okay, I fire the bottle right away.
133:33:56|CDR|...
133:33:57|CMP|No, I would.
133:33:58|CDR|...
133:33:59|CMP|No, no.
133:34:00|CDR|...
133:34:01|CMP|... No sooner than I fired that goddamned bottle, than wow; and away we went.
133:34:10|LMP|...
133:34:32|CDR|No - they're way down so, I don't know - just ...
133:34:34|CMP|Then, when I fired the bottle, and then, just about all that came ... since the thing started, I went back to CMC, AUTO, ... bothering me. And just about that time all those ..., my God, those flashes ... I thought they were ... I thought we were ...
133:35:10|CDR|... I mean later on ... all those ...
133:37:06|LMP|Look at this.
133:37:08|CDR|Yes.
133:37:09|LMP|Figured nobody could see where we were ....
133:38:08|CMP|Hey, did we decide the ... back?
133:38:38|CMP|No, the data should go to the log ... The only good thing there you can say about it is ...
133:38:55|LMP|... you guys. ... love them ...
133:39:51|CMP|All that probe and drogue and tunnel and claptrap works; all that EVA transfer, you can forget about that and all those crazy procedures for taking that probe apart.
133:40:12|LMP|At least, we can forget them until the debriefing.
133:40:14|CMP|Yes (laughter).
133:40:55|LMP|...
133:41:23|CMP|This thing ... make a great ...
133:42:04|CDR|Picked up the CSM problem.
133:42:38|CMP|I've never thought about it.
133:42:50|CDR|...?
133:42:51|CMP|No.
133:42:54|LMP|All at once.
133:43:19|CDR|None of them.
133:44:31|CDR|Yes.
133:44:44|CDR|... long time.
133:44:51|CMP|It's ...?
133:45:34|CDR|You got something ...?
133:45:38|CMP|Yes. Yes, sir. Purring across the deep. Okay. Look at that.
134:57:22|CDR|Yes. We can get VERB 64 before we come over the hill and see what looks good.
134:57:28|LMP|Okay. LOS.
134:57:30|CDR|Okay. I'm ready to proceed now.
134:57:34|LMP|Do it.
134:57:37|CDR|Here we go.
134:57:42|CMP|Say, you guys, ... anything you want to do?
134:57:56|CDR|I got to make a star check, yet.
134:58:07|LMP|You're not going to fool around with that camera anymore, are you?
134:58:09|CDR|No.
134:58:11|CMP|I'll take care of it for you.
134:58:13|CDR|Post - we might - after post - after PDI if you can put it somewhere where you can get at it. Going away from the moon. I just didn't want it in my way - -
134:58:25|CMP|Get all - -
134:58:26|CDR|Well, yes, pull it - pull it out of the way.
134:58:27|LMP|Neil, the handle -
134:58:29|CDR|I have it right here. That durn near has a roll in it - it -
134:58:38|CMP|I'll bet you ... likes this.
134:58:42|CDR|No. I don't care about any - Well, if it's annoying - let me - I can get it if it is. ... star check ... I don't care about ...
135:00:00|LMP|What's that pad say about horizon on the 100-degree - -
135:00:05|CMP|2 minutes prior, 100-degree line,
135:00:18|CDR|You got double lines?
135:00:19|CMP|Yes, I got double line on the 30, so I can use that as a head position ... look down between them.
135:00:25|CDR|They're not - they're not parallel? Can you see in the one-eye position?
135:00:30|CMP|What I'm saying is, on the 30 degree, I have both panes of glass - -
135:00:34|LMP|Yes.
135:00:36|CMP|- - and if you line those up then, then is your eye in the right position for all the others?
135:00:39|LMP|Yes.
135:00:40|CMP|Okay.
135:00:41|CDR|What's the shaft and trunnion number?
135:00:45|CMP|1511.
135:00:47|CDR|What? 1511?
135:00:52|CMP|151 - -
135:00:54|CDR|1511.
135:00:55|CMP|We're a long way from being there, Neil; we're rolling over at a very slow rate.
135:00:58|CDR|Okay.
135:01:00|CMP|You want an extra ... - we got a lot of gas - -
135:01:01|CDR|No, no, no.
135:01:02|CMP|Be happy to zip on around.
135:02:16|CMP|This thing is taking forever to get around here; we've got 20 minutes to TIG. I think I'll speed it up a bit, if you don't mind.
135:02:24|CDR|Hey, you got - 1, 0.1, point 1 you mean?
135:02:29|CMP|Yes.
135:02:44|CMP|You know, if you hit this hand controller like you do in the simulator, MINIMUM IMPULSE, just bang it, it'll bang over and bang back, and it'll fire two opposing pulses, and you get nothing. You know that?
135:02:53|CDR|(Laughter) Yes.
135:05:18|CMP|Oh, shit. ... yaw out 14 degrees. Why in the hell didn't I do that? Read that number wrong.
135:05:29|CDR|Yes, it should have been 1.4 degrees yaw.
135:05:37|LMP|That "1" gets moved over so far.
135:05:40|CMP|Yes, the goddam "1" in this computer, you know - trunnion angle, it's there; DELTA-V, it's there; angles, it's there. It's probably over here for something although I can't think for what, but there, there, there, and there, of course – there is four places.
135:05:55|LMP|Okay, we're there, Neil; by the time you can get down there and get your eyeball out the window - -
135:05:59|CDR|Hey, what did you do with those numbers again?
135:06:01|CMP|Oh, we'll crank them in the computer.
135:06:03|CDR|Oh, I got them.
135:06:08|CMP|Questioning the accuracy of the computer?
135:06:14|CDR|...
135:06:23|CMP|Okay, you satisfied with that?
135:06:24|LMP|ENTER.
135:06:27|CMP|Give me the numbers.
135:06:29|CDR|1519, CMC OPTICS ZERO, OFF, VERB 41, NOUN 91.
135:06:37|CMP|You mean after I went to all this work of cranking those numbers in you're going to drive back to zero?
135:06:43|LMP|We got PROGRAM ALARM and an OPERATOR ERROR.
135:06:46|MS|(Laughter)
135:06:47|CMP|Christ. Give me the numbers, 1519 and what?
135:06:54|LMP|It won't pass with that number.
135:06:58|CDR|1511 - 357.
135:07:01|CMP|357, okay.
135:07:15|CMP|357 and 1511. There's supposed to be a star there.
135:07:26|CDR|That's right, if you put them in - in the right order. That 151.1 is shaft.
135:07:36|CMP|Yes. I got a star in the - in the sextant.
135:07:38|CDR|Good, it passes. Let's press on.
135:07:41|CMP|I'm not sure it's Gienah.
135:07:43|CDR|Good. There'll be no way of telling - You got 16 minutes until TIG. Did it pass?
135:07:51|CMP|OPTICS ZERO - -
135:07:52|CDR|OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL. The mode is manual already, isn't it? Okay?

135:08:25|CMP|I'll proceed with this ...
135:08:27|LMP|Huh? ... Don't you like this one? Alright.
135:08:33|CMP|Let's not proceed.
135:08:35|LMP|Alright. Stand by. Align spacecraft in roll. Already there.
135:08:41|CDR|GDC align.
135:08:44|CMP|Okay, that's a good one. One - standby 1, and I'll get that.

135:11:11|CMP|We have 12 minutes to go.
135:11:54|CMP|Got the HELIUM VALVES, AUTO and barber pole?
135:11:58|LMP|I'll get those.
135:12:00|CMP|Okay. I was just wondering if they were on – not questioning your checklist, just out of curiosity.
135:12:29|LMP|You going to pitch up after the burn?
135:12:33|CMP|Sounds like a good idea; let's look at the moon after the burn. That'll give us high gain, right?
135:12:41|LMP|Check.
135:12:52|CDR|Okay, 10 minutes until TIG.
135:12:55|CMP|Alright.
135:13:10|CDR|It's hot in here, isn't it?
135:13:17|LMP|... boiling any water.
135:13:21|CDR|You do it all?
135:13:22|LMP|No. It's not too hot, it's 65.
135:13:31|CMP|Those temperatures are deceptive. I don't know where they measure it, but the cold point is -
135:13:36|CDR|Okay. Sunrise, now 10 minutes prior to TIG; I should have the horizon on the 10-degree line, huh?
135:13:43|CMP|No, 10 degrees - 2 minutes.
135:13:45|CDR|2 minutes; that's more like it, there.
135:14:00|CMP|... this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless.
135:14:09|CDR|...
135:14:12|CMP|I'm graphically reminded of it at this moment. Yes. I see a horizon. It looks like we are going forward (laughter).
135:14:26|CDR|Shades of Gemini.
135:14:29|CMP|It is most important that we be going forward (laughter).
135:14:40|CMP|There's only one really bad mistake you can make there.
135:14:50|LMP|Shades of Gemini retrofire, are you sure we're - (laughter) - No, let 's see - the motors point this way and the gases escape that way, therefore imparting a thrust that-a-way.
135:15:03|CDR|Yes, horizon looks good.
135:15:06|LMP|Okay, we got 8-1/2 to TIG.
135:15:28|CMP|Somewhere along the line, I think I'll trim this maneuver just for the hell of it. Would this be a good time to do it, Buzz, at 8 minutes prior? You don't care when I do it, do you?
135:15:35|LMP|No, it probably would be after we - when the gimbals are out.
135:15:38|CMP|Oh, yes, alright. Okay.
135:15:47|CDR|Beautiful looking horizon, it's hard to describe.
135:15:50|LMP|We can see it if we look through that thing you have.
135:15:53|CMP|Where's ...?
135:15:55|LMP|Here or here? God, it has an eerie look to it. It's not a horizon, it's just a band.
135:16:03|CMP|You won't be able to see it, Neil, ...
135:16:07|CDR|Which way?
135:16:09|CMP|This way. Plus X ...
135:16:14|CDR|It was really eerie when it first came - -
135:16:17|LMP|You got to look through the part of the window that isn't -
135:16:20|CDR|Yes. And the way the terminator is, you don't see the whole moon at all, you just see a - -
135:16:24|CMP|I know, I was looking at it upside down for a while.
135:16:27|CDR|Yes, and then that scares you, because that says you're going retrograde, right? Well, let's see, if it's upside down, you're going backwards.
135:16:33|LMP|Yes.
135:16:40|CDR|Okay, it looks good, I'll tell you.
135:16:44|CMP|Alright, we'recoming up on bus tie time; we've got a little over 6:50 until TIG.
135:17:05|CDR|Ready for the bus ties.
135:17:07|CMP|Yes, sir. Whenever you are; it's about 6 minutes.
135:17:10|CDR|... ON, verified.

135:23:51|CMP|Man, that feels like g, doesn't it?
135:23:56|LMP|I caught up - I caught up for a short while, but ...
135:24:03|CMP|... pressures are good. Busy in steering, but it's holding right in there.
135:24:13|LMP|How is it, Mike?
135:24:19|CMP|It's really busy in roll, but it's holding in its deadband. Looks like it's holding instead of plus or minus 5, more like plus or minus 8 - It's possible that we have a roll-thruster problem, but if we have, it's taking it out. No point in worrying about it. Okay, coming up on 1 minute -
135:24:44|CMP|MARK it -
135:24:45|CMP|1 minute. Chamber pressure's holding right on 100.
135:24:46|LMP|... time looks good.
135:24:48|CMP|Gimbals look good; total attitude looks good. Rates are damped out - a little bit. Still a little busy, light ...
135:25:01|CDR|... still ahead.
135:25:08|CDR|Should I be going ...?
135:25:11|CMP|Follow the needle; follow the needle ... Take it off. Okay. Looking good.
135:25:21|LMP|This was ... - -
135:25:22|MS|...
135:25:24|CMP|How's that nitrogen pressure? Okay?
135:25:25|CDR|Yes.
135:25:26|CMP|Good.
135:25:36|CDR|... pressures are GO.
135:25:42|CMP|2 minutes -
135:25:43|CMP|MARK it -
135:25:45|CMP|Hits the end of that roll deadband, it really comes crisply back.
