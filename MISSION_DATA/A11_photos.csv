Note that the sewn-on cuff checklist can be seen on the wrist cover of Buzz's left glove, the one closest to the right suit leg. Note, also, that Buzz is not going to wear a strap-on pocket. See, also, AS11-40-<a href=""#5903"" target=""new"">5903</a>. Ken Glover believes that the grey square at the upper right, just below the bubble helmet, is a photographer's grey card; it is certainly not an EMU component. The pattern of Velcro strips and snaps surrounding the connector cluster provided for installation of what seems to have been called an ""umbilical cover"". There is considerable evidence that the Apollo 11-14 LM crew members' suits all had a similar pattern of Velcro and snaps but, as of June 2007, we have been unable to locate any indication - in photos, checklists, and EMU handbooks - of an umbilical cover having been flown.

Note that, although the astronauts have removed their helmets, they are still using their Portable Oxygen Ventilators to provide air circulation and cooling. Note that the units attached to the suits have white hoses while the unit on the left has black hoses. Perhaps because each unit could only provide oxygen for a limited amount of time, at least two sets of units were used sequentially from the time that the crew started breathing pure oxygen in the suiting room until they were hooked up to spacecraft oxygen. Journal Contributor James Hill calls attention to the fact that, as can be seen in launch-day photo <a href=""#69H1121"" target=""new"">69-H-1121</a>, units with white hoses were in use as they boarded the transfer van for the trip to the pad and, as can be seen in launch-day photo <a href=""#KSC69PC399"" target=""new"">KSC-69PC-399</a>, by the time they were on the swing arm, they were using black-hose units. In a May 2007 exchange of e-mail, Apollo suit tech Troy Stewart indicated that the black hoses were probably the same as the white hoses except that the outer, thermal insulation had been removed. We do not currently know if there was a thermal reason for using two different units or if the units could provide oxygen for less than the hour that the crews typically used the POVs and the difference in the hoses was a means of keeping track of the units.

Having lost the camera 5 minutes earlier, he has missed a sunrise photo, but he captures the glaring sun in the sky above the ocean, rising rapidly as a result of their orbital motion. He takes a further 8 photos at this point, through to AS11-36-5301. AS11-36-5298 is the best one showing the low pressure cell."""|

It simply monitored the level through a capacitance probe and added LH as the LH evaporated following the filling by the Propellants section and through pressurization, after which there was no boil off.

Because there are neighbor nozzles doing the same thing there is even more pinging 'upwards.' Couple that with a suction behind the detached part of the supersonic shock wave forming on the side of the S1-C stage and you get that dirty fire creeping up the rocket.

Buzz has a hammer holder on his belt over his right hip and has a <a href=""../tools/judy101.jpg"" title=""image"" target=""new"">weigh bag</a> hooked to his right, front pocket. Inside the weigh bags, we see the telltale shape of at least one closure tab on an individual sample bag. As can be seen in photo S69-25202, Buzz has a pack of individual sample bags attached to weigh bag. The pack of sample bags is badly out-of-focus but, in S69-25903, an identical pack is clearly visible attached to Jack Swigert's weigh bag. 24 February 1969. Scan courtesy NASA Johnson."|

One of the pins, not yet installed, can be seen on the near righthand edge of the camera platform. Scan by Kipp Teague. Paul Coan, Manned Spaceflight Center Television Subsystem Manager who was responsible for the equipment used on the Apollo spacecraft, writes, ""The camera was mounted on the MESA upside down because the top plate was the 'hard' part of the structure. It was placed at an angle so that the bottom of the ladder could be viewed when the MESA was fully deployed. (There was some concern about whether the MESA would deploy fully &acirc;&#8364;&#8220; but that was not a problem.) The top was painted with a special white paint to minimize solar absorption and to maximize radiation. In contrast, the bottom was highly reflective to minimize absorption of heat reflected from the lunar surface. The handle/camera interface was designed with two trunnions and two 'hooks' and a latching mechanism so that, as you rotated the handle to its operating position, the handle was latched to the camera. It also provided the suited astronaut the capability of unlatching the camera."""|

Mike Gentry at NASA Johnson gives a date for the photo of 9 July 1969, but this may represent the date when the photo was released to the public and that the date it was taken was earlier. Research by Frederic Artner. The suit is shown with a strap-on pocket attached to the left thigh, as was the case during the EVA. In a detail from S69-38889 ( <a href=""a11pckt388809.jpg"" title=""image"" target=""new"">166k</a> ), we see some horizontal strips of Velcro hooks on the outside of the top flap which, on later missions, mated with horizontal strips of Velcro pile on the suit to hold the flap open. In the detail, we see that a loop of Velcro has been added been attached to the flap and a corresponding strip of Velcro has been attached over the front of the left hip. Further details of a typical strap-on pocket can be found in an <a href=""../a16/A16ShinPocket.html"" target=""new"">Apollo 16 discussion</a>. The suit shown in that discussion is Charlie Duke's training suit, which had horizontal strips of Velcro pile just above the knee, because Charlie wore his strap-on pockets on his shins. Ulli Lotzmann notes that the card placed between the boots that reads &quot;PGA 076&quot; is wrong. The actual serial number of Neil's PGA is 056. The mistake is undoubtedly due to the fact that the <a href=""a11NAA_PGA_LinerAssemblyLabel.jpg"" title=""image"" target=""new"">serial number of Neil's suit 'liner assembly' is 076</a>. The person who created the card probably saw the serial number of the liner and thought that was the number for the entire PGA as well. Bill Ayrey (ILC) has provided &quot;<a href=""Armstrong056ILC_FitCheck.pdf"" target=""new"">the fit-check record</a> from the day that Neil was initially fitted into his 056 suit. It was on December 5, 1968 at 5 PM (which was on a Thursday). Mel Case was the ILC engineer performing the fit check. Neil came back to ILC on Saturday, May 3, 1969 for his final fit-check in the 056 suit.&quot; Journal Contributor Roland Suhr notes that there isn't a mission patch on the suit. Photos <a href=""#S6938489"" target=""new"">S69-38489</a> to 38517, taken during an EMU Crew and Cabin Fit-and-Function (CCFF) session on <a href=""A11CrewTrainingSummaries.pdf"" target=""new"">25 June 1969</a>, also show the flight suits without mission patches. Clearly, the patches were put on the suits no earlier than 25 June. On 27 January 2014, ILC Historian Bill Ayrey wrote: &quot;ILC was responsible for preparing the suits which included sewing the patches on. NASA was responsible for providing the patches which as I recall, they bought from a company named Lion Brothers. (Bill is correct. See Gene Dorr's patch <a href=""http://genedorr.com/patches/Intro.html"" target=""new"">webpage</a>.) Ron Woods was one of our ILC suit technicians at the time and actually suited Buzz up for his Apollo 11 mission. &quot; On 28 January 2014, Ron Woods told Ayrey &quot;We were very late on sewing on the Beta (cloth) Flight Patches. Maybe two weeks prior to launch. And, of course, they were top stitched with the sewing machine and then carefully hand sewn through the top layer of the TMG (Thermal-Micrometeoroid Garment).&quot;"|

At 0544, the sonic boom of the spacecraft dropping below the sound barrier alerted the ship to its impending arrival. The president watched the following astronaut recovery activities from this spot.|
195:57:04|NS-ha-052||http://www.navsource.org/archives/02/cv-12/ha-052.jpg|OnceColumbiawas upright, UDT Swim Team 2 deployed from theirSea Kinghelicopter. They attached a sea anchor to slow the drift rate of the CM, and a flotation collar to stabilize the rocking spacecraft and two rafts to be used as work places. The lead swimmer then signaled to start the decontamination process. Helicopter #66 (SH-3DSea King, BuNo 152711) dipped low near the water to allow the decontamination swimmer LTJG Clancy Hatleberg to jump from the cargo hatch. On the next pass, the helicopter lowered the decontamination equipment to a work raft, including 4 biological isolation garments (BIGs) and two canisters of decontaminate solution.|

As seen in the photo,Neil Armstrongcame out first and half slid into the raft. The BIG suits did not have a grippy sole for the foot and the flotation collar was slick with salt water. Michael Collins came out next and then ""Buzz"" Aldrin. Two other issues that slowed the process were the BIG face visors fogging over in the tropic humidity and having to wear bulky ""water wing"" life vests."|
