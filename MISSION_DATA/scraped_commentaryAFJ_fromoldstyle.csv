|The crew are called by Mission Control after a good nights sleep. As they have breakfast, they photograph what will subsequently become an iconic view of the whole earth showing Africa, Europe and Arabia. Midcourse Correction 3 is cancelled, while they check and adjust various spacecraft systems.
048:19:48|It is actually the spacecraft meter that is reading low, but the readings from the sensors are also radioed to Earth and can be read by Mission Control on the ground. MCC can apply a more sophisticated analysis of the telemetry from the engine to generate a more accurate reading of chamber pressure when compared to the relatively crude meter in the spacecraft.
048:42:54|These cloud cells are both visible in photos <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5352HR.jpg" target="new">AS11-36-5352</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5353HR.jpg" target="new">5353</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5354HR.jpg" target="new">5354</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5355HR.jpg" target="new">5355</a>.
051:38:23|PAO is referring to the conversation given above. The audio available for the next conversation is incomplete.
053:51:57|Mike's point is that if it's 2:30 in the afternoon, it isn't the morning.
055:04:45|With instructions to retrieve certain documents, the crew are now preparing to enter the Lunar Module Eagle, and televise the operation.
|The crew of Apollo enter the Lunar Module Eagle for the first time, and make an unplanned televsion transmission of their activites. The camera is performing extremely well and shows the interior of the lunar lander with unprecedented clarity.
|Three photos were taken to show the drogue in the CM cabin. These are <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/images/print/AS11/36/5382.jpg" target="new">AS11-36-5382</a>, <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/images/print/AS11/36/5383.jpg" target="new">5383</a> and <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/images/print/AS11/36/5384.jpg" target="new">5384</a>. Journal contributor Jon Hancock has composited these into a single view that shows a wider context of the drogue in the cabin.
|Buzz is referring to the film-loaded Data Acquisition Camera, not the TV camera, which he will later mount looking out of his window to record the descent to the Moon, and their excursion on the lunar surface.
057:04:05|As Buzz continued to work in the LM, a series of still Hasselblad images were taken of the cabin's interior taken from the rear. Journal contributor Jon Hancock has composited these into a single image that shows the cabin space.
|After finishing their work in the Lunar Module, Armstrong and Aldrin return to the Command Module and close the hatches. They put the spacecraft back into the Passive Thermal Control roll, then update their Flight Plan at Houston's request. As the crew settle down for the night, they spot a curious flashing object in the distance and discuss it with Mission Control. Apollo 11 continues its outward coast, leaves the Earth's sphere of gravitational dominance and passes into the Moon's domain.
057:59:38|Verb 49 will command the computer to automatically maneuver the spacecraft to a desired attitude, in this case, the initial attitude for the PTC.
058:41:46|As Neil keys his microphone, music can be heard playing in the background. The crew are relaxing as they have their meal.
058:41:51|Landing site obliques are images of the landing site viewed, not from above as would be convention, but from the side, at an oblique angle.
058:46:27|SPAN is Spacecraft Analysis, a team of engineers outside the MOCR who stood by ready to work problems on the spacecraft and who constantly batted around what-if scenarios to try and catch problems before they developed.
060:45:46|The crew have noticed an unexplained flashing object out of the window, which appears to be catching the sunlight as it tumbles. Neil is wondering whether it is the abandoned third stage of the Saturn launch vehicle.
060:49:14|The answer from Mission Control indicates that the mystery object is highly unlikley to be the S-IVB stage, given its great distance from Apollo 11. Although the object's identity was never resolved, it is quite possible that it is one of the SLA panels which covered the Lunar Module during launch.
060:51:39|End of flight day 3.
|As the crew sleep, Apollo 11 falls towards the Moon, now accelerating under its gravitational pull in the final leg of its outward journey. On waking, the spacecraft passes into the Moon's shadow and they see star constellations and the solar corona clearly for the first time. The Service Module's main engine is fired to enter a lunar orbit very close to the planned dimensions, and the crew witness their first Earthrise.
069:13:14|GOSS is the Ground Operational Support System.
071:56:00|They are currently about 19,000 km from the Moon. The Moon's diameter is 3,474 km. At their current distance, its angular diameter is about 10 degrees. In comparison, the Sun's angular diameter as seen from the Earth or Moon is about 0.5 degrees.
071:56:35|McCandless may be trying to use mental arithmetic to convert two lunar diameters to its equivalent in solar diameters. The correct answer is about 40 solar diameters.
071:56:52|The outer parts of the corona are known as the F-corona and represent sunlight reflected by interplanetary dust particles. In the plane of the ecliptic beyond roughly 40 solar radii, it is often called zodiacal light. At that distance, it is about 500 times fainter than the inner parts of the corona visible from the ground during a total solar eclipse. What Neil is reporting out as far as two lunar diameters (80 solar radii) may be light coming from the outer F-corona. See <a href="http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/5006_07/50060493.pdf" target="new">Brightness of the Solar F-corona (PDF)</a>
072:29:37|From this point, McCandless takes turns with backup LMP Fred Haise in reading up the news.
072:29:46|Pravda was the main official newspaper, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
072:30:35|Ironically, the moon walk would only be broadcast in black-and-white, although orbital TV from Apollo 11 was in color.
075:41:20|At 075:41:23, precisely when Houston predicted, the radio signal from Apollo 11 is lost.
075:42:05|Armstrong is reminding Collins because he failed to have his sun shade ready to block the sun's glare during TLI.
076:14:08|The crew of Apollo 11 are about to re-establish contact with Mission Control as they re-emerge from the far side of the Moon.
|Apollo 11 emerges from the far side of the Moon and reports a successful insertion into lunar orbit. The crew get their first good look at the Moon, observing the crater Aristarchus by Earthlight and transmitting television views of their landing site. They prepare for another lunar engine firing which will bring them into a tighter lunar orbit, then make this burn over the far side.
076:41:37|High pressure nitrogen gas is used to actuate the valves that feed propellant to the SPS engine. During the burn, engineering data from the spacecraft was recorded on the DSE tape recorder. this data, along with crew voice recordings is played back to Earth on an auxiliary radio channel as soon as the spacecraft comes back into view.
077:12:51|Aristarchus is the brightest crater on the face of the Moon.
077:43:34|This appears to refer to the monocular.
078:27:45|At this point in the air-ground recording, the Flight Director's microphone finds its way onto the recorded audio.
078:28:57|Mike is flying the stack in 'orb-rate' so that the windows stay facing the Moon as they go around. In this mode, the angle between the spacecraft and the flight path is called 'theta' and is similar in concept to an aircraft's pitch angle. However, there is a phenomenon called gravity gradient stabilisation whereby a spacecraft with an uneven mass distribution (the CSM and LM being a pretty good example) will eventually align itself with its long axis radial to the planet it is orbiting.
078:37:32|Crater KAMP is not a formal lunar feature name. Rather, it was named by Mike who planned to use it as a navigational landmark much as Jim Lovell used Mount Marilyn for a peak near the crater Secchi. KAMP honours Mike's family, being the initials of his three children and his wife: Kate, Ann, Michael and Patricia. The Foaming Sea, Mare Spumans, is on the eastern limb of the Moon as viwed from Earth.
078:44:12|To flesh Neil's story out a little more, although Michiel Van Langren was one of the first telescopic mappers of the Moon, almost every name he gave to its surface features failed to stick. Much of the Moon's major nomenclature is attributed to Giovanni Riccioli and only one name has survived from Van Langren's map, the self-named major crater Langrenus.
079:48:28|Phil Shaffer was Flight Dynamics Officer. He died in 2007. The eccentric orbit post-LOI-2 was done to compensate to some extent for the lunar mascons. The hope was that by making it eccentric in the first place, it will circularise itself by the time of rendezvous with Eagle's ascent stage.
080:07:38|This is the SPS engine gimbals being tested. As the engine bell sways, the spacecraft reacts in the opposite direction.
080:13:42|Although no-one other than his crewmates can currently hear this, Buzz is leaving a message to those who will review the tape after the mission.
080:35:30|Now successfully in the correct lunar orbit for tomorrow's departure of the Lunar Module, Apollo 11 is about to emerge from behind the Moon and resume radio contact with Mission Control.
|Apollo 11 has completed two orbits of the Moon. While around the far side, and at the beginning of its third orbit, it made a 17-second burn of its SPS engine to make its orbit roughly circular. Between now and the end of the fourth day, Apollo 11 will pass over its intended landing site to let the crew view landscape features they will use as navigation aids during the next day's descent. They will re-enter Eagle, transfer over equipment, and check the landing craft's systems.
081:29:49|Command Module 101 had flown on Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo flight, nine months earlier. Columbia is CM-107.
081:40:25|The crew have now re-started the on-board tape recorder in anticipation of Loss Of Signal in about 4 minutes.
081:44:20|They are debating which 70-mm Hasselblad stills camera is the correct one to take into the LM. The other one has to stay in the CM.
081:44:32|The LM Pilot's girth shelf is on the right hand side of the CM interior.
081:47:34|Collins is in the CM, and 'up there' is in the LM.
081:47:52|Coughing is heard on the voice recording.
081:48:21|A sneeze is heard on the voice recording.
081:50:40|Since Aldrin and Armstrong have spun around 180 degrees to assume the correct orientation on entering the LM, from their perspective the CM is also 'up'!
081:56:36|By 'open the window', Aldrin means remove the window shade.
082:37:20|A-1 probably refers to Apollo Landing Site 1, a site that had been reconnoitered by the Apollo 8 crew. By Apollo 10's launch, managers had decided to go with a site further to the east, ALS-2. It is ALS-2, or a point a few kilometres west of it, that will eventually become Tranquillity Base.
082:55:30|US-1, or U.S. Highway number 1, was the informal name given to Rima Hypatia I, a rille near Moltke. The geological feature looks like a road.
083:20:28|Goldstone in California has radio dish receivers of 210-feet and 85-feet diameter.
083:43:24|The spacecraft now passes behind the Moon and will shortly complete its fourth lunar orbit. Out of contact with Earth, the crew's conversation is recorded on the on-board tape recorder.
084:05:05|The Cat's Paw is a misshapen crater group, about 2 miles wide, lying west of the Apollo 11 landing elipse. They will later fly over it on their ascent from the Moon.
085:14:19|This refers to the Barbra Streisand song 'People', which has the line: 'People who need people are the luckiest people in the world'. It was written by Styne and Merrill for the Broadway musical Funny Girl in 1964. The crew are listening to a cassette recorder as they wind down for their sleep period.
085:16:35|By the phrase 'present time in orbit', the PAO announcer really means the spacecraft's orbital period.
086:20:18|AOS is actually 86:28:15.
086:32:51|This is the end of flight day 4. Communications with Mission Control resume in seven hours, at 93:32:19.
|This part of the transcript commences soon after the commencement of the crew's rest period leading to wake-up on flight day 5. The crew report on various spacecraft systems and receive the morning news from Mission Control. Armstrong and Aldrin enter Eagle to get ready for the landing ahead, while Collins stays behind in Columbia and prepares to undock the two spacecraft. Then the still-docked craft pass behind the Moon on their twelfth lunar orbit.
095:17:28|Chang-O is also spelled Ch'ang O and, in the more modern rendition, Chang'e. Change was subsequently adopted as the name of the Chinese unmanned lunar exploration programme, the first spacecraft of which was launched in 2007. The third in the series, Chang'e 3, was the first to land which it did autonomously on 14 December 2013 in Mare Imbrium. The rabbits name of Yutu, stated by Evans as not reported, was given as the name of the first Chinese lunar rover, delivered to the surface by Chang'e 3 and it translates to 'Jade Rabbit'.
095:30:27|The crew now re-start the oboard voice recorder.
096:46:19|This means on Armstrong's channel.
098:14:50|The Lunar Module's four landing legs have deployed to the open position with a bang, and the talkback indicator on the instrument panel has turned grey, as confirmation.
098:15:26|The PAO recording at this point does not include the air-ground signal and only has the output from the PAO announcer's microphone. This configuration is maintained until about 098:24:50.
098:24:34|Air-ground audio recording on the currently available archive is restored
098:26:34|130 is the designation number of tracking landmark crater on the lunar surface they intend to use.
098:41:41|These are the informal names given by the Apollo 10 astronauts to two sinuous rilles or channels in the Sea of Tranquillity.
098:46:03|In fact, Armstrong had reported this about 20 minutes earlier, at 98:27:46, but Mission Control did not acknowledge it.
098:47:38|The LM crew are pressurising the LM RCS tanks by firing explosively actuated valves which allow helium gas into the tanks where it acts on bladders that contain the propellant.
098:55:45|John Young was Command Module Pilot on Apollo 10, two months earlier, and he had tested the navigation and tracking procedures for Apollo 11.
099:29:16|Apollo 11 now passes out of radio contact behind the Moon. When on the far side they will un-dock, and re-emerge as two separate spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle.
|This part of the transcript commences as Apollo 11 passes behind the Moon on its last orbit before undocking. It re-emerges as two separate spacecraft with their own call signs, Columbia and Eagle. They make one further lunar orbit, then the Eagle enters its descent orbit by firing its main engine behind the Moon. This section of the transcript ends with the spacecraft re-appearing from behind the Moon, prior to the Eagle making its final descent and the first lunar landing in the Sea of Tranquility, an account of which is continued in the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal.
100:22:01|Two cameraman are in the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) to film the events. Courtesy of journal contributor Stephen Slater, these clips, which were filmed mute, have been synchronised with the air/ground audio and, where appropriate, the Flight Director's loop.
100:30:16|Collins means 9 minutes, 30 seconds until his engine firing which will separate the CSM from the LM.
101:03:09|The error is Mission Control's, not that of Collins.
101:16:30|Two cameraman are in the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) to film the events.
101:30:31|While the PAO announcer has his microphone keyed, a voice in the background can be heard counting down, '3, 2, 1...'.
101:45:54|He is pitching the Lunar Module forward so that the engine thrust axis is correctly aimed for PDI when they arrive at their perilune. This will be about 500 km east of the landing site.
102:05:51|It is actually 27:20 to the PDI burn. This may be a mistranscription.
102:14:59|At this point, this edition of the Apollo 11 Flight Journal hands over to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, first chapter, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html" target="new">The First Lunar Landing.</a> The following 2 minutes or so of dialogue are provided as over-lap with the ALSJ to facilitate read-across, and to bring the Flight Journal up to the point of Acquisition Of Signal on the last orbit before landing.
102:16:00|Being in a higher orbit, Columbia regains contact with Mission Control first. Eagle is now flying faster in its lower descent orbit, dropping towards the surface. Although somewhat closer to Earth than Columbia, Eagle is more closely hugging the surface and remains hidden behind the Moon for almost two minutes longer.
102:17:29|Having now re-acquired signal, first from Columbia then from Eagle, Mission Control starts to monitor closely the Eagle's continuing descent, leading up to engine re-ignition as it approaches the landing site. The flight transcript continues in the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, first chapter.
|Eagle is now safely back in its initial lunar orbit. It next goes through various maneuvers to rendezvous with Columbia. Collins takes over when the two craft are a few yards apart and docks Columbia to Eagle.
124:31:23|Having just queried the PGNCS about the size of their orbit, Buzz has asked the AGS for its determination. PGNCS: 47.3 by 9.5 nautical miles (87.6 by 17.6 km). AGS: 46.6 by 9.5 (86.3 by 17.6 km). The two systems with their independent gyros and accelerometers are in remarkable agreement.
124:34:09|The PAO has slipped up in saying Spider, the code-name of the Apollo 9 LM, when he means Columbia, the Apollo 11 CM.
124:57:24|These are angles to which the steerable dish antenna can be aimed in an effort to improve communications.
125:05:57|The ground's computation of the CSI maneuver is 51.5 feet per second (15.7 m/s) which, as Neil will reveal on the onboard recording, equals the solution in the LM.
125:30:57|Most of the noise we associate with a rocket engine is produced by the violent and turbulent interaction of the exhaust gases with the atmosphere through which they flow. However, in the LM, the gases are expelled straight into a vacuum. What little noise comes up
125:37:38|This appears to be a water leak, mentioned later at 126:13:01.
125:43:22|Armstrong is referring to Gene Cernan's Lunar Module Snoopy, on Apollo 10.
125:58:36|Aldrin means the Earth rising over the horizon, and he is asking whether a laser was being fired at the Moon as part of an experiment also undertaken earlier in the mission. It would be used to target the reflector they had left on lunar surface the previous day.
126:53:04|Mox nix is attributed to the German idiom, macht nichts, meaning 'it doesn't matter'.
128:05:22|Apollo 11 has re-emerged from the far side of the Moon on the 27th orbit as a single docked spacecraft, no longer using the separate call signs of Columbia and Eagle.
|Armstrong and Aldrin rejoin Collins in Columbia, transferring over their moon rocks, films and other equipment.
128:45:43|The CM docking probe will not be needed after the LM is jettisoned, so they plan to abandon it inside the Eagle and save weight for Columbia's return journey to Earth.
129:12:58|Armstrong is allowing Collins a quick look at the Contingency Sample, the first small bag of lunar soil he collected on the surface. He scooped this up and put it in a pocket, in case he and Aldrin had to depart quickly. Although he did not reach the surface, Collins becomes the third human being to get a close-up look at lunar soil. Armstrong's last comment appears to be an instruction not to open a different bag of samples.
129:13:26|At this point Collins possibly makes a remark, not picked up by the onboard recorder, about the gray color of the lunar samples. That would elicit the following ironic wit from Armstrong.
129:29:47|Armstrong and Aldrin finally leave Eagle and rejoin Collins in Columbia. Mission Control's next call to Eagle, when Apollo 11 reappears from the far side of the Moon, erroneously assumes Eagle is still crewed.
129:57:20|An hour ago at 128:58 they planned to perform the LM jettison at 131:52, so they now expect to do it about 1 hour, 20 minutes ahead of the plan.
130:19:11|No longer having two separate manned spacecraft, the different CM and LM call-signs are no longer needed. However, CapCom had got used to using them.
130:49:55|This is one of many examples of Collins' quick wit. 'All the News That's Fit to Print' is the motto of the New York Times, and it appears on the newspaper's front page.
131:08:46|Armstrong and Aldrin, having worn their space suits continually since leaving Columbia the previous day, have now removed them. Collins had put his back on for the docking and is still wearing it. They will all undertake the Trans-Earth Injection engine firing without suits on.
131:10:01|Collins is asking about the troublesome spirit level bubble on the Passive Seismic Experiment which Aldrin deployed on the lunar surface.
133:45:38|Apollo 11 is now about to reappear from behind the Moon on its 30th lunar orbit. They crew have stowed their equipment and received from Mission Control the necessary data to perform the Trans-Earth Injection engine firing which will send them homeward. That event is now about 1 hour and 40 minutes away, and they have little to do but wait.
|When behind the Moon, Apollo 11 fires the large engine on the Service Module to accelerate out of lunar orbit and enter its homeward-bound trajectory towards Earth. The crew photograph the receding Moon, and receive a call from the Head of the Astronaut Office, Deke Slayton.
136:21:40|Jay Greene was one of NASA's premier Flight Controllers and had earlier been FIDO (Flight Dynamics Officer, or FDO) for the descent and landing of Eagle. He was the Flight Director for the Space Shuttle Challenger during its disastrous ascent in 1986.
136:52:52|The aircraft carrier USS Hornet is due to pick Apollo 11 up in the Pacifc Ocean after splashdown.
137:17:37|Armstrong's estimate is a little short, which is unsurprising due to the difficulty of judging distances on the lunar surface. As indicated by Vlad Pustynski's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Photogrammetry.html" target="new">photogrammetric mapping for the Apollo 11 site</a>, the PSE was emplaced about 24 metres [80 feet] from the main body of the LM descent stage, at the 9.30 o'clock postion, where the LM's straight forward orientation is 12 o'clock.
138:01:52|Owen Garriot of the Purple Team has taken over as CapCom from Charlie Duke of the White Team.
138:08:24|Now safely coasting towards Earth, the exhausted crew of Apollo 11 can finally sleep soundly and will remain out of radio contact for almost 10 hours. Mission Control continues to monitor the spacecraft systems, of course, and the astronauts can be woken up if the situation requires it.
|Apollo 11 passes out of the Moon's gravitional dominance and returns to the Earth's sphere of influence. The crew undertake Midcourse Correction number 5 to refine their path towards Earth.
|Tropical storm Claudia was a Pacific Ocean depression upgraded to storm status on July 22 but downgraded again on July 23.
147:47:31|These are the crew sleep hours, in the running order Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin.
148:01:58|The sternal leads come from biomedical sensors postioned over the sternum, or breastbone.
148:07:31|Phil Shaffer was FIDO on Cliff Charlesworth's Green Team though with the staff movements made for the landing, his position is being taken by Dave Reed at this time.
148:07:58|In his autobiography, Mike tells how Shaffer struggled to explain to non-technical journalists what the concept of crossing the equigravisphere actually meant. At this point, the trajectory experts would change the reference for their calculations from Moon-centered to Earth-centered and, due to the relative speeds of these two objects, there would be a jump in stated velocities. Apparently some journalists were convinced there must be a physical jump felt by the crew, a nonsense that crews played with throughout the Apollo programme.
148:23:13|Wilbur 'Weeb' Ewbank (1907-1998) was coach at the New York Jets football team from 1963 to 1973. Wally Lemm (1919-1988) was his counterpart at the Houston Oilers.
149:04:17|Mission Control is referring to a water leak incident discussed at <a href="19day6-rendezvs-dock.html#1253738" target="new">125:37:38</a>, and mentioned again at <a href="19day6-rendezvs-dock.html#1261301" target="new">126:13:01</a>, in Day 6, part 2.
151:41:28|When Neil refers to the EASEP, it sounds more like PSEP and he may be referring specifically to the seismometer whose official name is the Passive Seismic Experiment. The crater visited by Armstrong is now generally referred to as either Little West crater because of its proximity to West crater, or as East crater because it lies to the east of the landed LM.
153:53:59|Apollo 11 is now about 7 hours into Flight Day 7 and accelerating towards Earth. The crew are continuing to have a quiet day and are about to begin preparations for a television broadcast.
|As their leisurely day continues, the Apollo 11 crew demonstrate their food and beverage preparation during a television transmission. They make some arrangements for their forthcoming return to Earth, then settle down for the night.
155:23:26|The Mars fly-by mission mentioned was one of the pair Mariner 6 or Mariner 7. At this time, 22 July, Mariner 6 was 9 days away from Mars encounter, and Mariner 7 was about 14 days away. With Mars looming ever larger in their cameras, these missions were being closely monitored prior to the intense activity of Mars encounter.
155:36:42|The Eidophor was a television projector used to make large images on a screen. They were in use from the 1950s until the 1990s and NASA had one in Mission Control.
155:37:42|CapCom Charlie Duke has confused the Moon with the Earth in the TV monitor, and is also referring to the continuing uncertainty about where Eagle actually landed. It will only be resolved after their return to Earth.
155:42:43|CapCom appears to mistakenly think that Armstrong has the TV camera.
155:43:24|Buzz handles a wrapped food cube.
155:49:35|Collins breaks the spoonful of water, which was held together by surface tension, into flying globules and catches some in his mouth. He then gets out the water spigot with attached hose.
155:58:53|There were several telecommunications satellites of the Intelsat 3 type. Intelsat 3 F-5 is the one in question, which was launched on 26 July 1969 and was left in an unstable orbit due to a third stage malfunction in the launcher. NASA PAO chose to include the Delta PAO feed into the Apollo 11 feed for the press.
159:52:02|Before interpreting this Entry PAD, an explanation of some of the terminology may be useful. The first important concept is that of Entry Interface, a completely arbitrary event which is defined as the time when the spacecraft (by then only the Command Module) reaches an altitude of 400,000 feet (65.83 nautical miles, 121.92 km). It is chosen as it is easily calculated from the spacecraft's current state vector and does not depend on the vagaries of the atmosphere.
160:25:45|With the crew of Apollo 11 in their second last sleep period before splashdown, the spacecraft continues to function extremely well, now overseen by the Black Team of Flight Controllers.
|After wake-up, the crew of Apollo 11 have the daily news read up to them, update their Flight Plan, and check various aspects of spacecraft. They pass the half-way distance point between the Moon and Earth.
|Gregs father Charles Force was Director of the Tracking Station on the island of Guam. At about 10pm on July 23rd he recalls his father had him picked up from his home, where he was with his mother and brothers, and brought to the station. A stuck bearing meant the antenna could not move. Greg did not actually replace the bearing, but he greased it through a narrow hole where an adult arm could not reach. That was sufficient to allow the antennae to move again and continue tracking Apollo 11. Greg later met Neil Armstrong, who thanked him in person. Charles Force died in 2007.
173:36:42|Romania was a communist country at this time, but somewhat renegade in voicing some differences from the USSR and seeking to culitvate independent relations with the West.
173:38:29|As of July 2009, Module McGhee is living in Columbus, Georgia. She is a mother and a special education teacher, and apparently loves her unusual name. She was mentioned in Norman Mailer's "Of A Fire on the Moon", 1970.

174:00:05|Earlier Mike read a series of voltages to Garriott. Mission Control has converted those voltages to temperatures for the RCS engines. For these readings 0V to 5V represents a range from -50&deg;F to +50&deg;F, 100&deg;F overall. The lowest voltage reading was 4.5V and since 1V represents 20&deg;F, this reading must represent 10&deg;F below the maximum, or 40&deg;F.
175:07:39|Launch was of course on July 16.
176:27:21|After a relaxed morning, the crew of Apollo 11 have been up for about 6 hours, and are now preparing for the final TV transmission of the flight.
|In their final television transmission from the spacecraft, the crew of Apollo 11 comment on the historic significance of their voyage. Then they stow various items in preparation for tomorrow's re-entry. Mission Control gives them the weather forecast for their Pacific Ocean splashdown.
177:56:30|c.g. = centre of gravity.
179:16:13|At this point, the PAO audio feed switches to coverage of the launch of a Delta rocket carrying the Intelsat 3 satellite. The launch does not go ahead and PAO returns to coverage of the Apollo 11 mission.
180:23:45|The contents of these tapes are reproduced above.
181:27:42|Collins was speculating that the unfamiliar voice who has taken over as CapCom from Bruce McCandless might be Ken Mattingly or Owen Garriott, both of whom share duties at the CapCom console with McCandless. In fact it is Chuck Lewis, who was Assistant Flight Director to Gene Kranz on the White Team.
182:04:47|The PAO announcer is mistaken in the duration off the rest period. It is 7 hours, not 10 and their wake up time is scheduled at 189 hours.
182:08:16|This concludes the transcript for flight day 8 and the subsequent overnight period. The journal continues with crew wake-up on their last day in space.
|The crew of Apollo 11 waken about five hours before splashdown, to be told that the final Midcourse Correction in the Flight Plan, the seventh, is cancelled. They photograph the Earth as it expands rapidly in the windows of their spacecraft. The Service Module is jettisoned and the crew see it maneuvering away automatically. Re-entry is followed by a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii.
190:22:36|'In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)' was written by Rick Evans in 1964 and became a hit for Zager and Evans, a musical duo from Nebraska, in July 1969.
190:31:42|These numbers are the crew's report on their sleep hours, in the order CDR, CMP, LMP.
193:02:32|Another example of Jim Lovell's teasing humour.
193:02:53|The mice will be used to test the toxicity of lunar soil samples.
193:31:33|BEF - Blunt end forward. The correct orientation for the Command Module during re-entry, and another piece of astronaut humour.
194:10:32|According to a list of <a href="http:/www.nasm.si.edu/events/apollo11/reliveapollo11/cast.cfm" target="new">key Apollo 11 personnel</a> on the website of the National Air &amp; Space Museum, the pilot of Swim 1 was Donald Richmon.
194:24:57|Collins has carried out the horizon check ten minutes early. It should have been 194:33:06.
194:35:07|Meaning manually set camera at f:16 aperture and 1/250th of a second shutter speed.
195:18:18|In the movie &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; (2006), Mike Collins recalled: &quot;I can remember the beautiful water. We were out in the deep ocean in the Pacific. It was such a startling violet color. I remember looking at the ocean and admiring: 'nice ocean you've got here planet Earth'.&quot;
195:18:18|Television pictures show President Richard M. Nixon approaching the Mobile Quarantine Facility on the hangar deck of the USS Hornet, where he has been waiting to greet the astronauts.
