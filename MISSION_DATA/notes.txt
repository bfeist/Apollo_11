027:22:41|T|CC|Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.
027:27:47|T|CC|How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?
027:27:52|T|LMP|Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.

056:03:44|T|LMP|The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.
