|The transcript begins over two-and-a-half hours before launch. With the Apollo 11 spacecraft sitting atop its Saturn V launch vehicle on Pad 39A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, announcements on the progress of the countdown are made by the Public Affairs Officer (PAO) Jack King, the 'Voice of Apollo'. The record of communications between the crew and the Mission Control Center, through 'CapCom' (the Capsule Communicator) commences soon after lift-off. This section of the journal will follow the flight through the launch and staging of the Saturn V launch vehicle, and insertion into Earth orbit about 12 minutes later. It concludes with the confirmation of orbital parameters and the safe check-out of the S-IVB third stage in orbit.</div>
|Journal contributor Stephen Coester was a 28-year-old engineer who was working at a console (called C4HU) at the Launch Control Center. In a PDF file, <a href="pdf/stephen-coester-apollo11-lh2-leak.pdf">Launching Apollo 11 to the Moon</a>, he tells the story of this hydrogen leak.</div>
|In fact, Fred Haise is the back-up Lunar Module Pilot. The other back-up crew members are Commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Bill Anders.</div>
|When the crew arrived at the spacecraft they were already suited up and sealed off from Earth's natural atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen. By the time they are ascending, they will have been breathing pure oxygen for about three hours and will have flushed dissolved nitrogen from their blood. This is to guard against the possible formation of nitrogen bubbles in their blood as the spacecraft air pressure drops to its nominal value of about a third of sea-level pressure, or in case of an unintended decompression of the spacecraft. Between the suiting-up room and the spacecraft, each crewman carried his own oxygen supply in a suitcase-sized unit.</div>

|The lowest of the Saturn's main tanks was filled with 810,000 litres of RP-1 three weeks earlier. RP stands for 'rocket propellant' which in this case has been highly refined to minimise the fuel's sulphur content. The range of lengths of the molecule chains that make up the fuel was reduced to around 12 carbons to ensure more consistent and predictable combustion properties. The level in the tank was checked again at T-13 hours and again at T-1 hour.</div>
|All three stages use liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidiser component in the burning process. It has been rendered liquid by being cooled to about -183&deg;C, just below its boiling point thereby allowing large quantities to be carried in huge tanks. At nine hours before launch, nitrogen gas is pumped through the tanks to purge out air and water vapour contaminants. Six and a half hours before launch, the tanks are precooled to prepare them for the loading of LOX. The S-IC requires 1.3 million litres, that for the S-II takes 331,000 litres and the S-IVB's LOX tank requires 77,000 litres.</div>
|Filling these tanks with such cold liquids requires a little finesse. Initially, the LOX is fed at a slow rate which furiously boils as it contacts the relatively warm tank structure. The vapourisation of the LOX takes heat away until a pool of liquid begins to form at the bottom. When enough liquid has collected, filling steps up to a fast rate until the tanks are nearly full. The slow rate is then reestablished to top them off. From then on, until three minutes before launch, the level is replenished as the volatile LOX continues to boil off from heat leaking into the tank.</div>
|The fuel for the S-II and S-IVB stages is liquid hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>). Like LOX, it must be cooled to render it liquid, this time to -253&deg;C which is only 20K above absolute zero. Conditioning the LH<sub>2</sub> tanks is more involved because all gases will freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen except helium. Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold helium gas through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. After filling at a fast rate, and to compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before launch when the tanks are pressurised. Up to the launch, pressurising helium gas is supplied from the ground. After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure. For the S-IVB, additional pressurising gas comes from a set of helium spheres mounted on the stage.</div>
|Range safety is concerned with ensuring that if the rocket were to go wayward, it would do so without threatening injury or death to those on the ground. The Saturn's propellant tanks have shaped explosive charges attached. In the event the launch vehicle cannot be controlled, these would be detonated to open the tanks and ensure their contents are dispersed while at altitude. The charges for the fuel tanks are placed on the opposite side of the vehicle from those for the oxidiser tanks so as to minimise the degree to which the propellants would mix as they are dispersing.</div>
|The next announcement comes from the PAO at Mission Control in Houston, rather than the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy, Florida.]</div>
|The commentary now resumes with the PAO at Launch Control, Florida.</div>
|At the very top of the launch vehicle, between the S-IVB and the spacecraft, is a ring, only 1-metre-tall, called the IU (Instrument Unit). The ring's diameter matches the rocket stage below it. It carries systems primarily concerned with the guidance and control of the vehicle. These include a digital computer, an analogue flight computer and an gyroscopically stabilised platform mounted within three gimbals. This platform's ability to stabilise itself is such that without external influence it would stay in a constant orientation with respect to the stars even while Earth turns and it would therefore appear to slowly rotate, even though it is actually Earth that is rotating. This is an effect known as gyrocompassing. However, while the launch vehicle is sitting on the pad, the platform must not gyrocompass. Instead, its pitch or Y axis should be at right angles to the intended heading of the vehicle, a heading which depends on the precise time of launch.</div>
|In Apollo 11's case, a 9:32 am launch requires that the Saturn's groundtrack away from the launch pad will be on a bearing of 72.058&deg;. Therefore, the platform is aligned so that the minus-Z axis lies along that heading (or azimuth) and a servo system holds it there, not allowing it to respond to Earth's rotation. This is achieved using a theodolite located 210 metres directly south of the vehicle which shines a beam of light through a window in the skin of the IU and another in the casing that surrounds the platform. The platform's orientation with respect to the theodolite will be maintained until just 17 seconds before launch. After that, it is released and will maintain its orientation with respect to the stars.</div>
|When the Saturn V sits on the pad, its axes are aligned with the points of the compass. But in order to fly along the intended heading, it must carry out a roll manoeuvre as soon as it has cleared the tower. This will align the vehicle's coordinate system with that of the platform. From then on, simply by carrying out a pitch manoeuvre, the vehicle will begin its tilt towards the horizontal while flying along the desired heading.</div>
|The phrase 'guidance is internal' refers to the moment at T minus 17 seconds that the Saturn V's guidance system is no longer held in an orientation with respect to Earth. It is now inertial and holds an orientation with respect to the stars. It has already been prealigned to a azimuth of 72.058&deg;, the rocket's intended heading. Soon after launch, the vehicle will roll around in order to match that orientation before commencing a preprogrammed pitch manoeuvre to send it heading for low Earth orbit. This moment is more formally called Guidance Reference Release or GRR. GRR begins a 16-second period that inhibits the first of the Saturn V's control timebases.</div>
|The F-1 engine has a complex ignition sequence which will be described here. First, a description of the engine.</div>
|A large combustion chamber and bell have an injector plate at the top, through which RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure through 2,816 holes. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine section of this turbopump is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a chamber called the gas generator. After they power the turbine, these gases pass through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds them into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself.</div>
|Directly above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump with two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets that feed high pressure fuel, via shut-off valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these feeds supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid, though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground, it being more suited for this purpose. At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator.</div>
|The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel. To ensure ignition, a cartridge of fluid sits in a branch of the high pressure fuel circuit. It has burst diaphragms at either end and its own inject points on the face of the injector plate. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15 per cent triethylaluminium (known as TEA/TEB) and it is pyrophoric (i.e. self igniting) in the presence of liquid oxygen. Older documents refer to this substance as being hypergolic.</div>
|At about T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer initiates a number of automatic operations in the engine which includes the firing of four pyrotechnic devices. Two of them are mounted inside the nozzle extension and cause the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters. Another two initiate combustion within the gas generator. Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, causing it to begin slowly rotating' The LOX then flows through the injector into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes another valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and their exhaust gas cause the turbine to accelerate. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve, which lets fuel pressure reach the igniter cartridge which promptly ruptures. TEA/TEB fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its ports where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.</div>
|Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the build-up of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.</div>
|This diagram shows how the thrust rose during the start-up of each engine. It takes two seconds for full performance to be attained on all engines once the first has begun to increase. The engines are started in a staggered 1-2-2 sequence so that the rocket's structure would be spared a single large load increase, with the centre engine being the first to start. The outboard engines exhibit a hiccup in their build-up due to the ingestion of helium from the pogo suppression system installed in each one. The centre engine does not have this installed.</div>
|As the flow of fuel and LOX rises to maximum, the chamber pressure, and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved. With the turbopump at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.</div>
|Public Affairs Officer Jack King, whose coolness is legendary, finally succumbs to the tension and is clearly heard to say "all engine running" instead of "all engines running".</div>
000:00:00|As the vehicle begins to rise, disconnection of an umbilical triggers the start of time base 1 in the Saturn V's control system. This sequence of events is concerned with the operation of the S-IC (except guidance) through most of its powered flight.</div>
000:00:04|As planned, control of the flight now passes from the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy, Florida to the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. There, communication with the crew is handled by an astronaut sitting at the CapCom console; in this case, Bruce McCandless. The PAO also switches, and Jack King relinquishes the commentary to the Houston PAO, whose voice is heard from now on.</div>
000:00:15|When it sat on the launch pad, the space vehicle's coordinate system matched the cardinal points of Earth's geograpic system. Its X-axis pointed straight up and its Y-axis pointed to true north. The third component of this system, the Z-axis, therefore was pointed directly west. Before it begins to tilt over, the vehicle needs to roll 18&deg; so that the minus X-axis, previously facing east, faces along the planned heading, in this case 72&deg; east of north. Then the tilt motion will be a simple pitch motion around the Y-axis.</div>
000:00:15|Prior to the roll maneuver, the vehicle executed a small yaw maneuver to deliberately lean away from the launch tower during its first few seconds of ascent.</div>
000:00:15|20.6 seconds after launch, time base 1 aims the four outboard engines slightly away from the centreline of the vehicle. This is in case an outboard engine fails whereupon the resultant off-centre thrust vector would be nearer to acting through the centre-of-mass of the rocket.</div>
000:00:42|Like the Space Shuttle that came after it, the flight of a Saturn V had defined times during which the means by which the crew could escape from a failing vehicle were defined. Unlike the Shuttle with its solid rocket boosters which gave no escape option during their operation, the Saturn had so-called 'abort modes' throughout its ascent, even during first stage boost. One of the advantages of liquid-propelled rockets is that they can be shut down. Solid motors will burn until they are done.</div>
000:00:42|For the first two abort modea, one-alpha and one-bravo, rotation rates exceeding &plusmn;4&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll will entail an abort.</div>
000:00:42|The first 42 seconds are flown in abort Mode One-Alpha. If things went wrong with the launch vehicle during this time, the Launch Escape Tower (LET) would lift the Command Module away from the booster. However, at this early stage, the CM needs to be taken away out to sea as the vehicle has not yet imparted much horizontal velocity. To achieve this in a One-Alpha abort, a small 'pitch control' motor would additionally fire to send the CM away from the vicinity of the impending conflagration. The CM then goes through an automatic sequence to carry out a safe landing on Earth.</div>
000:00:42|Mode One-Bravo is similar except the pitch control motor would not be required since the vehicle would have tilted over enough to aim an escaping CM out to sea. Instead, during a One-Bravo abort, a pair of canards at the tip of the LET would deploy to force the CM-tower combination to adopt a CM-first attitude. This was because hypersonic testing had shown that the CM-LET combination had a stable tower-first attitude. This mode extends to about 35.5 km altitude.</div>
000:01:23|As it flies through the air, the rocket must withstand an aerodynamic pressure imparted by its speed through the molecules of the atmosphere. This is like the pressure felt on a hand stuck out of the window of a fast-travelling car. In the rocketry situation, two things are happening to vary this pressure: the vehicle's rising speed makes it higher; the rapidly thinning atmosphere brings it down. The interaction of these two variables leads to a point in the ascent when the aerodynamic pressure, denoted by the letter 'Q', reaches a peak. This is known as Max-Q and is the point when weaknesses in the rocket's structure are most likely to be found out, especially if it has any slight sideways motion through the air. Max-Q occurs at 1 minute and 23 seconds into the flight.</div>
000:01:59|Mode One-Charlie begins at an altitude of about 30.5 km. At this altitude and beyond, the air is too thin for the LET canards to be effective so control of the CM's attitude during an abort would initially go to the its maneuvering thrusters. The acceptable range of vehicle rotation is altered and is now &plusmn;9&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll.</div>
000:02:19|135 seconds after the start of time base 1, its programming shuts down the central or inboard engine of the Saturn V in order to limit the vehicle's rapidly rising acceleration. There are two reasons for this rise. The first and dominant reason is that the mass of the vehicle as a whole is dropping by over 13 metric tons every second. As a result, the engines have a decreasing mass to push against. A lesser factor is the rising efficiency of the engines as they ascend out of sea-level air pressure into the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere. At sea level, the atmosphere acts somewhat as a cap on an engine's nozzle, getting in the way of the exiting gases. In a vacuum, the exhaust gases can exit without hindrance. The result on the F-1 is a 20 per cent rise in thrust. As the acceleration nears 4g, the shutdown of the inboard engine reduces it by one fifth.</div>
000:02:19|This graph is redrawn from the AS-506 Flight Evaluation Report. It shows how the acceleration experienced by the crew varies over the course of the Saturn's ascent. The key events in the graph are: <ol> <li>Lift-off under S-IC power. Note how the acceleration rises rapidly as the propellant tanks empty and the engines increase in efficiency.</li> <li>Cut-off of the central or inboard engine engine of the S-IC as acceleration nears 4g.</li> <li>Cut-off of the remaining four outboard engines of the S-IC at a peak of 4g.</li> <li>S-II stage ignition. Note the reduced angle of the graph. Although the mass of the first stage has been discarded, the thrust of the S-II stage is one ninth of the final S-IC thrust.</li> <li>Cut-off of the inboard engine of the S-II at a peak of approximately 1.8g.</li> <li>Change in mixture ratio caused by the operation of the PU valve. The richer mixture reduces the thrust slightly but also increases engine efficiency.</li> <li>Outboard engine cut-off of the S-II at approximately 1.7g.</li> <li>S-IVB stage ignition. Note again the reduced angle of the graph caused by the thrust being cut by a fifth.</li> <li>With the cut-off of the S-IVB's first burn, the vehicle is in orbit and the acceleration drops to zero.</li> </ol> The 4g experienced at the end of the S-IC burn is the highest that will be reached during ascent. The only time a greater g-force will be experienced during the mission is upon re-entry at the end when over 6g will be imparted on the crew.
000:02:19|With the shutdown of the centre engine, the IU looks to see that the vehicle has gained sufficient velocity. If it has, then it begins time base 2 which will coordinate the end of the S-IC's flight, first by arming the separation pyrotechnics and by enabling the systems that detect the depletion of the S-IC tanks.</div>
000:02:19|The Saturn's guidance computer then performs 'tilt arrest'. Throughout the S-IC burn (and for the start of the S-II), the vehicle has been flying a series of pre-programmed maneuvers called the tilt sequence. The yaw at launch and the roll to align the rocket with the launch azimuth were two of these. The major maneuver of the tilt sequence has been a slow tilt around the pitch axis towards horizontal as the vehicle climbs. Note that this form of guidance is not trying to aim for a particular point. Though it is taking account of where it is and how any wind is affecting it, it is not attempting to correct for it and so it is described as open-loop guidance. At the end of the S-IC burn when staging takes place, it is no longer desirable to have the vehicle rotating, so the tilt maneuver is stopped or arrested.</div>
000:02:19|When level sensors detect that the S-IC tanks are about to empty, a signal is sent to shut down the four remaining F-1 engines. This signal also initiates time base 3 which will coordinate all the events surrounding staging and the flight of the S-II (apart from guidance).</div>
000:02:44|The S-IC first stage has shut down and separated from the S-II second stage.</div>
000:02:44|The sequence for separation is as follows: Half a second after shutdown of the first stage, four ullage motors mounted around the interstage are ignited. One fifth of a second later, a command is sent to fire the first separation explosive charge and to ignite eight retro rockets mounted in the conical fairings near the base of the S-IC. This results in two sets of rockets firing in opposite directions to pull the two sections of the vehicle apart once they are physically separated. 0.7 seconds later, the J-2 engines on the S-II stage receive their start command.</div>
000:02:44|The interstage ullage rockets were eventually deleted from the later Saturn Vs. Ullage is a brewer's term for the space in a barrel taken up by air rather than liquor. The rocket people modify its use to mean the establishment of a similar non-liquid space at the opposite end of a tank from the outlet so that only liquid leaves the tank with a degree of pressure to help it flow to the engine. This is usually achieved by firing small rockets to settle the tank's contents to one end.</div>
000:02:46|The S-II stage carries five uprated J-2 engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce a total of 5,141 kN (1,155,859 pounds) thrust. The engine design allows for restarting in flight but this feature is only implemented in the single engine used in the S-IVB.</div>
000:02:46|The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together to make a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously turn the fuel to a gas. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants. The hot gas exhaust is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell where its partial combustion is completed. The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the copper-faced injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector face is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this has 614 posts which pass LOX through holes in the injector face and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The gaseous fuel passes around each LOX tube, atomising the liquid as it emerges. Delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent of the gaseous hydrogen seeps through the injector face to keep it cool, the rest passing through the annular orifices.</div>
000:02:46|Valves are provided to bleed propellant through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings. The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter) is mounted in the centre of the injector face and fed with propellant. Energised by sparks at the start of a burn. it provides a flame to initiate and maintain full combustion.</div>
000:02:46|A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen. This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves while the hydrogen is used to spin up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust during flight to optimise stage performance.</div>
000:02:46|To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its tubular walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a pre-set delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the circumstances of the engine and the upcoming burn. A one-second delay is used for the S-II engines by virtue of them cooling each other in the confined space of the interstage. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the resultant exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14&deg; allowing LOX to enter the combustion chamber and begin to burn with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14&deg; is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.</div>
000:02:46|As the thrust of each second stage engine reaches 65 per cent, it causes its indicator light on the Main Display Console to be extinguished.</div>
000:03:15|Between the first and second stages is a large ring with a height of 5.5 metres and 10 metres in diameter to match the stages above and below. This ring, the interstage, is there to make room for the S-II's engines which protrude some distance below the bottom edge of the stage's wall. The interstage, or skirt, exists in its form because of the need to separate the two stages across two planes.</div>
000:03:15|Were the interstage to stay with the S-IC, there is a danger that any slight rotation of the massive first stage would cause contact between the giant ring and the engine bells on the S-II. Therefore the first cut is made directly above the S-IC using a shaped explosive charge to sever tension ties that join the stages. This leaves the interstage attached to the S-II. However, the ring imposes a significant mass penalty on the second stage. So much so that it is considered a mandatory abort if the interstage doesn't separate. Once 30 seconds has passed after the first separation, enough time for the second stage engines to establish smooth acceleration with minimal rotation, another explosive charge severs the ties that hold the interstage just below the S-II's tank assembly.</div>
000:03:15|It is interesting to note that the interstage failed to separate on the Saturn V that lofted Skylab to space. Nevertheless, controllers allowed the S-II stage to continue and it successfully inserted the orbital workshop into orbit, benefitting from the lower overall payload that Skylab represented.</div>
000:03:36|Although Armstrong as commander has his own window through the Boost Protection Cover attached to the Launch Escape Tower, and Aldrin in the center couch can see through the hatch window above his head, Collins in the right-hand couch has had his windows covered up to this point.</div>
000:03:36|These two videos, kindly donated by Stephen Slater, show the separation of Apollo 4's S-IC stage from its S-II across both planes. They were taken using film cameras mounted on either side of the S-II thrust structure, upper and lower. The cameras were ejected and, having parachuted into the ocean, were located by radio.</div>
000:03:36|Both videos are presented here at 23.976 frames per second, a standard film frame rate. However, they were shot at about 4 times this rate, probably 96 frames per second. Therefore, although in real time 30 seconds elapse between each plane separation, the same events in these versions are separated by two minutes.</div>
000:03:36|With the loss of the escape tower, the flight moves to abort mode two. Now if the vehicle goes awry, the CSM would separate from the Saturn and either the Service Module's main engine or its small thrusters would be used to gain distance before the CM continues to a normal landing in the sea.</div>
000:03:36|Six seconds after the jettison of the escape tower, the guidance mode of the Saturn changes from dumb to smart, from open loop to closed loop. This is the Iterative Guidance Mode (IGM) whereby the guidance system is now actively plotting a course to the point in space and velocity where it will insert the vehicle into orbit. While the Saturn was in the thicker parts of the atmosphere, it was undesirable to allow it to make large attitude changes, hence the pre-programmed tilt sequence. Now that the vehicle is essentially in a vacuum, the computer can react to its actual position and velocity and issue steering commands to the engines as required to reach its goal.</div>
000:05:21|COI is Contingency Orbit Insertion. It is essentially abort mode three and means that if the S-II were to fail, the S-IVB would have the capability to add sufficient speed for the Service Module's large main engine to complete the job and place the CSM in Earth orbit. Of course, the spacecraft would not be able to depart for the Moon as the S-IVB's power would have been consumed in reaching orbit. Instead, the spacecraft would embark on a planned for, but hopefully never used Earth orbit mission.</div>
000:06:00|In case the Service Module's engine has to be used in the event of an abort, power is applied to two gimbal actuators containing motors, clutches and jack screws that will rotate the engine in its mount so that its thrust can be applied through the spacecraft's centre of mass.</div>
000:07:45|Actually, it's just the one engine, the central engine in the cluster of J-2s. On earlier Saturn V flights, it was noted how severe vibrations would build towards the end of the S-II burn. This was caused by the centre engine, mounted on a set of cross beams, setting up a longitudinal vibration in those beams. The solution adopted from Apollo 10 onwards was to shut that engine down before the vibrations were expected.</div>
000:08:24|The J-2 engine included a valve that allowed the mixture ratio (MR, the ratio of oxidiser to fuel) to be altered during the burn. This MR change was made to maximise propellant utilisation, hence the name PU shift.</div>
000:08:24|On the S-II, the strategy was for most of the burn to be made at a high MR of 5.5:1 which also yielded the stage's maximum thrust. Once a specific velocity had been reached, which occurred 5 minutes, 31.8 seconds after the engines were commanded to start, the MR for the remaining four engines was reduced to 4.34:1 for the rest of the burn. The effect of this was two-fold: it reduced the thrust from the stage by a quarter but it also increased the specific impulse and therefore the efficiency of the engines. If engineers had the timing of the MR change right, the intention was that both the LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX tanks should both be as close as possible to depletion when sensors indicated it would be prudent to shut down the stage.</div>
000:08:24|On the very early Saturn V flights (Apollos 4, 6 and 9), the timing was based on a closed-loop decision. Level gauges within the tank monitored how the propellants were being consumed and the change made based on that data. However, mathematical modelling had shown benefits to an open-loop decision, one based on the change in MR occurring when a specific velocity had been reached.</div>
000:09:01|The signal to shut down the S-II's outboard engines also initiates time base 4 in the IU. Like the previous time base, this will coordinate the events around staging and the subsequent control of the third stage. In particular, time base 4 will shut down the S-IVB stage when orbital velocity has been reached.</div>
000:09:19|The sequence of events for the first ignition of the single J-2 engine in the third stage is essentially the same as for the engines in the S-II <a href="01launch_ascent.html#j2start" target="new">(see earlier description).</a> The main change is that the supercold fuel is allowed to flow through the walls of the thrust chamber to condition it for three seconds, instead on one, before the Start Tank discharges through the turbines, spinning them up in preparation for operation. Although the engine is enclosed in its own interstage structure, its isolation from other cold engines means it needs a little longer to chill the thrust chamber. For its next burn in over two hours time, it will have been exposed to the Sun's heat amd will require 8 seconds to chill the pipes.</div>
000:09:19|This well-known footage shows the separation of an S-IVB second stage from an S-IB first stage during the ascent of AS-202, a Saturn IB launch vehicle, on 25 August 1966. It is the only time an S-IVB was successfully filmed separating and igniting. What distinguishes this stage from an S-IVB used on a Saturn V was that this type had three solid-fuelled ullage motors mounted on its aft skirt whereas a Saturn V's S-IVB only had two. The three exhaust fans emanating from these three motors are very apparent.</div>
000:09:19|After the film was exposed, the camera was ejected and parachuted into the ocean, to be located by radio and recovered.</div>
000:11:42|The signal to shut down the S-IVB's first burn also initiates time base 5. This will control the transition of the S-IVB to the upcoming period of orbital coast.</div>
|Now safely in orbit, Apollo 11 circles Earth just over one-and-half times while still attached the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn launch vehicle. The crew remove their helmets and gloves, and for a while are free to move around the cabin. They unstow equipment, take some photographs, check the spacecraft systems and make star sightings to refine the alignment of their guidance platform. When over Hawaii for the second time, the S-IVB stage re-ignites to perform the Translunar Injection burn that will send them on their way to the Moon.</div>
000:18:54|'P52' refers to a program within the onboard computer with which Mike will realign the spacecraft's inertial platform.</div>
000:18:54|Before launch, the platform at the centre of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was aligned to match the orientation of the launch pad at the moment of launch. For mechanical reasons, the orientation of this platform is prone to drifting away from the intended orientation so at regular points throughout the flight, it is realigned. This tendency to drift is normally very small but the intense vibration and shock that is present during launch and ascent tend to exacerbate it. Controllers can see this misalignment by comparison with the Saturn's own platform so prior to the first P52 realignment of the flight, they pass up a rough estimate of how much misalignment the CMP can expect to compensate for. This is the 'delta azimuth correction' figure.</div>
000:19:11|At the moment that Apollo 11 was inserted into its parking orbit around Earth, an effort began to determine the shape of that orbit. In the first place, controllers wanted to be sure the stack had enough momentum to continue around Earth and was not about to re-enter the atmosphere. Then from an operational standpoint, a good understanding of the orbit was a necessary starting point when calculating the burn that will take the spacecraft to the Moon. Initial indications came from the spacecraft's computer and ground estimations. But as the spacecraft passes over tracking stations, each will add further data points, especially those in Australia which are essentially on the opposite side of the world and which will provide an antinode determination of the orbit.</div>
000:23:52|The Public Affairs Officer then replays a tape of the air/ground communication that covers the ascent phase but which excludes his original commentary. Meanwhile, on <em>Columbia</em>, the DSE recorder is placed into record mode. This records digital data from sensors around the spacecraft so that engineers will be able to study its health for those periods that it is out of direct communication. The DSE includes a voice track to record the conversations in the cabin which is later replayed, along with the digital data, at high speed to a ground station. It is normal practice for this equipment to record throughout the ascent but this was evidently missed on this occasion.</div>
000:29:22|Buzz is quoting from page 2-9 of the Launch Checklist. Now Mike and Neil will pick up on step 7 from halfway down that page, and this is to configure the Environmental Control System (ECS) for the mission now that the launch phase has been completed.</div>
000:29:56|A few minutes before launch, the spacecraft's glycol/water coolant was prevented from flowing through the Service Module's two large radiators. The heating effects of passing through the atmosphere at high speed rendered them unable to reject heat and so a bypass valve was opened. Now that the radiators are in space, this valve is closed to restore the flow.</div>
000:29:59|The crew have a number of Hasselblad 70-mm (film width) stills cameras on board. These have detachable film magazines that can be changed part way through a roll. To prevent the film from being fogged upon removal from the camera, each has a 'dark slide', a thin metal plate that must be inserted to cover the film gate before the magazine can be detached.</div>
000:30:08|To determine that the radiator is doing its job, they will check that the temperature of the coolant at its outlet is colder than at the inlet.</div>
000:33:18|Mike is unstowing the DAC movie camera from a locker below the couches. Built by Maurer, it uses 16-mm wide film stock.</div>
000:35:41|Buzz is referring to the 18-mm lens that Mike has installed on the 16-mm DAC movie camera.</div>
000:35:52|Meanwhile, the Public Affairs Officer has been replaying a tape of the air/ground conversation through the launch phase to the press.</div>
000:38:46|An external cover on the opposite side of the Command Module from the crew hatch has protected the external surfaces of the navigation system's optics during launch. The cover is now ejected when Mike pushes a lever in the Lower Equipment Bay.</div>
000:39:27|Radar shows Apollo 11 to be in an extremely accurate circular orbit with an altitude of 103 nautical miles, better than earlier estimates.</div>
000:39:40|The side of the spacecraft opposite the hatch has two orifices through which the spacecraft's two optical instruments can peer. These are the telescope, a one-power, wide-field device intended to permit a star to be located within a constellation. It's field of view is ganged to one of the two lines of sight of the other instrument, a 28-power sextant with which angular measurements can be made. During ascent, the optics were protected by covers which Mike removes by pushing the optics control lever hard to the right.</div>
000:40:32|R-1 is the stowage locker at bottom right, below the LMP's couch.</div>
000:41:57|Mike is about to take sightings of the stars but must allow his eyes to become dark adapted.</div>
000:45:02|Mike is realigning the spacecraft's guidance platform in order to correct for any drift in its orientation since launch. This task is carried out with the aid or Program 52 in the computer and thus it is often called doing a 'P52'.</div>
000:45:02|The idea is simple. By taking sightings on only two stars, the orientation of the universe around the spacecraft can be determined. Coded into the computer's fixed rope memory are the positions of 37 stars, the Apollo star code list. Each has a numerical designation in octal (base eight).</div>
000:45:02|The computer therefore knows where these stars really are in the celestial sphere. With Mike's sightings, it now knows where they appear to be based on the current orientation of the guidance platform. Comparison of the two sets of data allows the error in the platform's orientation to be calculated and therefore be corrected. This is achieved by 'torquing' or rotating the platform by the required amount using the motors in the supporting gimbals.</div>
000:47:26|As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer can offer Noun 05 which has a value called the star angle difference. The computer knows the real angle between the two stars, thanks to its wired-in table, and it knows the angle between Mike's two sightings. If the two are identical, the star angle difference will be zero or 'all balls' thanks to it being displayed as '00000'. As it is, the value is '00001', four-balls one or 0.01&deg;, still a very good value and one which is better than predicted by one of his instructors at MIT, Glenn Parker. In his superlative autobiography, <em>Carrying the Fire</em>, Mike relates a story of having a bet of a coffee with Parker where Mike claimed he could achieve all balls whereas Parker thought he would only achieve four-balls two.</div>
000:48:15|Mike has sighted on star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri) and star 37 (Nunki, Sigma Sagittarii). The angles by which the platform needed to be torques were plus 0.018&deg; around the X axis, plus 0.033&deg; around the Y axis and plus 0.152&deg; around the Z axis. These results will be radioed to Mission Control at <a href="#0005335">000:53:35</a>.</div>

001:06:00|Neil seems to be passing around sweets.</div>
001:09:22|About now, Buzz turns to his left and takes a somewhat blurred color photo of Neil with the Hasselblad camera.</div>
001:09:22|Buzz then turns towards Mike and photographs him also, along with the TV camera which they have just been discussing.</div>
001:09:32|The television arrangements for Apollo 11 are complicated because it involves two cameras, one on the CSM and one on the LM. Each is fundamentally different from the other; the former is colour and uses commercial TV scan rates, the latter is monochrome and is essentially a slow-scan TV camera. As a result, there are two types of converters that are installed at some ground stations on Earth to convert their signals to a form that is compatible with conventional TV systems. Neil refers to a scanner/converter but strictly speaking, this unit is only for the LM's black and white camera whose slow-scan system is converted through an optical system. The CSM's colour camera is not slow-scan and is converted electronically using a magnetic disc system.</div>
001:09:32|Scanner/converters have been installed at the three major ground stations in Australia, Spain and at Goldstone in California. However, for the colour camera about to be exercised, the only equipment to decode the colour within its output is at Houston and Goldstone is going to link the raw signal from the spacecraft to the Manned Spacecraft Center.</div>
001:18:09|This is a jocular reference to the brevity of Armstrong's abortive flight on Gemini 8. Despite being the commander of Apollo 11, he has the shortest duration of orbital experience of the crew, albeit with the greatest experience of handling in-flight emergencies when he piloted the malfunctioning Gemini 8 back to Earth.</div>
001:21:45|During his Gemini 10 mission, Mike lost a camera overboard during a spacewalk.</div>
001:22:28|When the S-IVB engine ignites for TLI, it will impart an acceleration initially equivalent to 0.6g, rising to about 1.4g as the burn progresses. If the Hasselblad camera is not secured near the aft of the Command Module, there is a danger it could cause damage as it 'falls' to the floor.</div>

001:34:55|At regular points throughout the mission, the CapCom will read up lists of numbers for the crew to write down. These may be to help track a landmark as it passes below. Most often they are the data the crew will need to manually carry out a burn of their engines. They have the jargon 'Pre-Advisory Data' or just 'PAD'.</div>
001:37:31|This is similar to the form that Mike is copying the data into.</div>
001:37:31|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is a contingency in case of abort for a return to Earth with an ignition time approximately 90 minutes after TLI.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,481 pounds (28,794 kg). Strictly speaking, a more appropriate term to use would be &quot;mass&quot; rather than &quot;weight&quot;. Weight is defined as the force an object exerts when acted upon by gravity whereas mass is a measure of the quantity of matter an object contains. A 1-kg mass exerts 9.81 Newtons on Earth but we would tend to measure that force with a spring balance and call it 1 kilogram. On the Moon, it exerts 1.62 Newtons but its mass is still 1 kilogram so spring balances would have to be recalibrated to read properly. In space, without engines running (i.e. during coast), it exerts essentially no force at all yet still has 1 kilogram of mass.<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> -1.53&deg; and +1.32&deg;. The SPS engine is mounted on gimbals and can be aimed so that its force vector (the direction in which it pushes) acts through the spacecraft's centre of mass. These angles represent an initial direction for the engine. Once the burn begins, the spacecraft's control system continually adjusts the angle as the centre of mass shifts. Two thumb wheels on the left of the Main Display Console allow adjustment of these trim angles.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 4 hours, 10 minutes, 25.38 seconds. This is about 90 minutes after TLI.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -476.1 (-145.1); y, +0.1 (+0.03); z, +5,336.1 (+1,626.4). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> LVLH is a frame of reference that is relative to a line drawn from the spacecraft to the centre of the body it is orbiting, or whose sphere of influence it is in.<br> <div class="photo_wrapper"> <div class="photo"> <img src="pics/lvlh.gif" alt="Diagram to explain the Local Vertical/Local Horizontal frame of reference"> <div class="caption">Diagram to explain the Local Vertical/Local Horizontal frame of reference.
001:37:31|As well as the gyro-stabilised guidance platform, the spacecraft has a backup set of gyros. However, instead of being mounted on an independently stabilised platform, these are affixed to the spacecraft's structure. If the spacecraft rotates, these 'Body Mounted Attitude Gyros' (BMAGs) resist that turning and apply a force to their mountings. A measurement of this force provides the basis for a determination of attitude. If you know the starting attitude, then processing the signals from the BMAGs will permit the current attitude to be determined. It is the job of the Gyro Display Couplers (GDCs) to carry out this task, but there are two problems with this arrangement. First, the attitude measurement is much more prone to drifting away from the truth when compared to the measurements from the platform. Second, because of this drift, it regularly needs an accurate starting point. If the primary guidance system is working, then its knowledge of their attitude can be passed to the GDCs which is achieved merely by pressing the 'GDC Align' button. If, however, the primary system is not working, the GDCs must be aligned with reference to the stars. This is the reason that McCandless read up some GDC Align information.</div>
001:37:31|In the example given above, were the crew were to lose the platform and instead had to align the GDCs with the stars, they would rotate the spacecraft until the first star was aligned with the 50&deg; mark on the vertical line. The second star would be placed on the line but its position on the line would not be important. Then with the spacecraft in that orientation, its attitude with respect to the required REFSMMAT (the definition of their reference for attitude) would be given by the angles for roll, 71&deg;; pitch, 291&deg;; and yaw, 341&deg;.</div>
001:37:31|In addition, Mission Control sent up a second, short PAD which is intended for use in P37, a 'Return-to-Earth' programme.<br> <div class="photo_wrapper"> <div class="photo"> <img src="pics/p37.jpg" alt="Standard form in which crews copy P37 abort PAD data. Version in Flight Plan"> <div class="caption">Standard form in which crews copy P37 abort PAD data. This is the version in Flight Plan.
001:40:13|The docking probe at the tip of the Command Module is a crucial component of the docking system that will bring the CSM and the LM together. It will be used soon after they leave Earth orbit and head for the Moon to retrieve the LM from the top of the third stage. First it must be in its extended position. This is checked in Earth orbit because if it does not work, there is no point incurring the risk involved in heading for the Moon.</div>
001:41:33|Thus far, the sixteen thrusters of the spacecraft's RCS (Reaction Control System) have not been actually fired in space. All control of their attitude has been carried out by the engines or thrusters on the Saturn, so this is an opportunity to test this vital system while still in Earth orbit. The thrusters will have little effect as they will be acting against the mass of two fully loaded spacecraft and a nearly full S-IVB. Any deflection they make in the stack's attitude will be eventually cancelled by the booster's thrusters. Mission Control will be able to monitor both the firing of the thrusters and their effect on the stack's attitude via telemetry.</div>
001:43:40|Once they begin their burn for the Moon, the crew must be ready to detach the CSM from their booster if the latter begins to fail. To activate the explosive devices that physically cut the spacecraft free, certain pyrotechnic circuits and the sequencers that control their detonation must be armed.</div>
001:44:17|P00 is Program 00 though it is always pronounced as POO (like 'Pooh' in the A. A. Milne children's classic). Though the computer, a multitasking device, is always carrying out background tasks, it has a 'major mode', a program that is to the forefront of its activities and which is selected by the crew. For example, if the CMP wants to realign the guidance platform, he does so with the help of Program 52. On this occasion, Program 00 is selected which is a 'do nothing' program. They also threw a switch from Block to Accept. This Telemetry switch gives Mission Control access to the computer so they can directly access the 2K words of erasable memory that the computer uses for its sums and temporary storage. In this case, they want to upload a revised state vector into this memory.</div>
001:44:17|The state vector is a collection of six numbers plus time that define the spacecraft's position (in three dimensions) and velocity (also expressed in three dimensions). Now that the spacecraft has made a complete orbit of Earth, its state vector has been determined with some accuracy.</div>
001:44:26|TLI is Translunar Injection, the burn of the S-IVB that takes Apollo 11 out of Earth orbit and onto the Moon. The burn will raise Apollo's inertial velocity from 7,800 to 11,000 metres per second which will send it on a very long elliptical orbit with an apogee well beyond the Moon. The Moon's gravitational field will interfere with this trajectory, changing it to one that will bring the spacecraft around its far side and on a path back to Earth, a so-called free-return trajectory.</div>
001:46:25|This PAD is structurally different to most other propulsion PADs because the TLI maneuver is controlled by the IU (Instrument Unit) on the launch vehicle, and not the computer in the CM. The operational differences require that it is writen onto a different form.</div>
001:46:25|The timings for events relating to the launch vehicle are defined relative to a number of time bases, each of which start with a particular event. This allows controllers to move complete sequences of events relative to the overall mission time. The restart sequence for the S-IVB's single J-2 engine is called time base 6. When it begins, all subsequent events to restart the engine such as tank repressurisation, engine chilldown, ullage, etc., follow on, leading to the engine start command 9 minutes, 30 seconds later, and actual ignition 8 seconds after that.</div>
001:46:25|The crew also have tasks to perform in the minutes leading up to the TLI burn and they use their event timer to help them. They will preset it to read 51:00, to give them a nine minute count-up to ignition. At around 002:35:14, a light will come on for ten seconds to announce the start of TB-6. Thirty eight seconds later, the event timer is started and counts up towards (1:)00:00 and beyond. Items in the checklist are therefore shown with times from 51:00 onwards.</div>
001:46:25|The PAD is interpreted as follows.<br> <b>TB-6 predicted start:</b> This is calculated from current tracking data to be at 002:35:14, which implies that engine start will be commanded at 002:44:44 and that T<sub>IG</sub> (time of ignition) will be at 002:45:52. The actual start time is based on the solution to trajectory equations which depend on the vehicle's state vector.<br> <b>Attitude for TLI:</b> is 179&deg;, 71&deg;, 1&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively. This attitude is stated with respect to the orientation that the guidance platform has held since launch.<br> <b>Burn duration:</b> 5 minutes, 47 seconds.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub> prime:</b> 10,435.6 fps. This is the figure they will enter into the EMS's counter to allow them to monitor the burn's progress.<br> <b>Inertial velocity at engine cut-off, (V<sub>I</sub>):</b> 35,575 fps (10,843.3 m/s).<br> <b>Attitude for separation of the CSM from the launch vehicle:</b> 357&deg;, 107&deg;, 41&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively. Among the criteria for adopting this attitude is solar illumination of the S-IVB to allow the crew to practice maneuvering relative to it.<br> <b>Attitude for the extraction of the LM:</b> 301&deg;, 287&deg;, 319&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively.<br> If the crew decide they need to abort the mission soon after TLI, they should adopt a pitch angle of 223&deg;.

001:57:12|Buzz is checking the Entry Monitoring System which will be used to monitor the velocity gained during TLI, and again during the Transposition, Docking and Extraction maneuver when the LM is removed from the top of the S-IVB stage after Translunar Injection.</div>
001:57:21|Since the GDCs prone to drift, a push of the GDC Align button will pass the more accurate attitude values from the IMU to the GDC, giving the GDCs an accurate starting point for their measurement of attitude.</div>
001:58:16|A counter within the EMS will allow the effect of the upcoming TLI burn to be monitored. The crew are loading a value of 10,435.6 feet per second into the counter which is the change of velocity they will expect from the S-IVB. As the burn progresses, this counter will decrement towards zero.</div>
001:58:25|ORDEAL is Orbital Rate Display - Earth And Lunar, a device that makes the crew's 8-ball displays turn at a rate that matches their movement around Earth or the Moon. Set up properly, it allows the crew to monitor the spacecraft's attitude with respect to the ground below rather than with respect to inertial space.</div>
002:04:44|The crew will keep track of events leading up to TLI and beyond with their event timer, which they preset to read 51:00. This way, once they start it counting up towards 00:00, it will mark out the nine minutes that lead up to the moment the S-IVB engine ignites. Times are given in the checklist based on this methodology.</div>
002:08:00|The S-IVB's hydrogen tank is still quite full of supercold liquid fuel which, despite its internal insulation, is absorbing heat from the Sun and slowly boiling off. The resultant hydrogen gas is fed to propulsive vents at teh rear of the stage. The very slight acceleration imparted by these vents acts to settle the propellants in their tanks. It also has the effect of slowly raising the altitude of the stack. As more energy is added to the orbit, its shape is enlarged and the stack gains height. Counter-intuitively, it also slows down but this is because height is being traded for speed.</div>
002:11:34|The reference to boiling water is to do with part of the spacecraft's cooling system. Their electronic systems generate large amounts of heat, some of which warms the cabin interior but much of which must be removed. The majority of heat removal uses two large radiators mounted near the base of the Service Module, one on each side. During periods of high activity, additional cooling is provided by an evaporator that uses the vaporisation of water to dump heat.</div>
002:11:34|Evaporators, often referred to by the crew as "boilers", rely on the fact that energy is required to convert a liquid to a gas. When water is exposed to a vacuum, it quickly evaporates, and in so doing, takes heat energy from its surroundings. In the evaporator, spare water that has been generated by the fuel cells is fed through metal plates via tiny holes in the plate. Once through, it encounters a mass of porous stainless steel known as a wick, the other side of which is exposed to space. The water evaporates and takes heat with it, then passes out through the steam duct which exhausts at a port just under the commander's window. Pipes from the coolant system are passed through the wick assembly where they give up their heat to the vaporisation process. There are two evaporators, one each for the primary and secondary cooling systems.</div>
002:11:34|The fact that the boiler is no longer evaporating water is likely due to a lower workload by the spacecraft's electronics or the radiators working better over Earth's night-time side.</div>
002:43:42|That is, when the Event Counter on the main CM control panel reaches 42. In other words, when there are 18 seconds remaining.</div>

002:53:47|Apollo 11 is now safely out of Earth orbit and on its trans-lunar trajectory. Next, it must separate from the final stage of the Saturn launch vehicle and extract the Lunar Module.</div>
|The Saturn V's third stage (the S-IVB) has boosted the stack into a very long, extended ellipse around Earth, the apogee of which is beyond the Moon's orbit. This trajectory has been arranged in such a way that the Moon will gravitationally intervene and cause the spacecraft to loop around the lunar far side. Having left the vicinity of Earth, the Apollo 11 CSM (Command Service Module) will separate from the third stage. The conical shroud that protected the LM (Lunar Module) during launch splits into four panels which are jettisoned. The CSM will then turn around to dock with the LM and extract it from its launch position on top of the S-IVB stage. The docked spacecraft will then prepare for an engine firing to move a safe distance away from the now-abandoned stage.</div>
002:54:09|The S-IVB stage, with the Apollo CSM still attached is going to change its attitude so that the Sun will shine across the top of the LM after separation. This will provide the correct illumination for the docking maneuver to follow, after the CSM has turned around 180 degrees.</div>
003:16:28|Mike has now taken over the left-hand seat from Neil in order to fly the CSM in the TD&amp;E maneuver.</div>
003:16:37|The Digital Event Timer will allow Mike to coordinate his actions. When the spacecraft comes off the S-IVB, he immediately wants it to start moving away. Therefore, he will begin thrusting forward just before separation.</div>
003:16:47|Mike is monitoring his speed with the EMS (Entry Monitor System). This unit includes an independent accelerometer and a velocity display. Procedures dictate that the display be set to read 100 feet per second, based on experience on Apollo 8 when it was found to not work well around the zero mark.</div>
003:16:58|Mike thrusts forward in the plus-X direction with the small Reaction Control System engines, so that when Buzz pushes the Sep (Separation) button on Panel 2, the CSM immediately starts to move away from the S-IVB stage and the jettisoned panels.</div>
003:17:11|Buzz is reading this off the Entry Monitoring System gauge.</div>
003:17:40|There are a set of valves that allow the crew to isolate the propellant tanks that feed the RCS thrusters. It was common for the shock of separation to cause a number of these valves to close. It was simply a matter of throwing the appropriate switches to open them again.</div>

003:20:15|The BMAGs are a set of Body-Mounted Attitude Gyros. These gyros are attached directly to the body of the spacecraft rather than being mounted on a stabilised platform. The force they exert on their mountings provides information on the rate-of-change of the spacecraft's attitude. A box of electronics, the GDC (Gyro Display Couplers), convert this information into a measurement of absolute attitude, though with a substantial tendency to drift.</div>

003:24:03|The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives the time of docking as 003:24:03.1.</div>
003:24:13|Three latches at the tip of the probe have engaged with the hole at the centre of the LM's drogue, achieving what is termed a 'soft-dock'. It is possible that there is a little sway of one craft with respect to the other so Mike allows the damping mechanism of the probe's tip to minimise it before he retracts the probe to bring the two ships to a 'hard-dock' condition.</div>
003:24:50|The CMC (Command Module Computer) has various modes of controlling the spacecraft's attitude, one of which is 'Free' where it makes no attempt to hold attitude. As it is now mechanically joined to the much larger S-IVB, it makes no sense for the CSM thrusters to fire as they will only fight those on the third stage.</div>
003:25:49|Given the various gyrations of the CSM, and Collins' concentration on the docking maneuver, they haven't established a good communications link with mission control. it will be another four minutes before CapCom gets through to them.</div>
003:44:16|The LM cabin is currently a vacuum. Prior to launch, a valve in the LM's overhead hatch was deliberately left open so that its atmosphere would evacuate during the ascent to space. To save using its consumables, the LM cabin will be repressurised using air from the Command Module cabin. However, the pressure in the CM must be kept within an acceptable range, so before they open the valve that will let their air into the tunnel between the two spacecraft, and hence into the LM, the crew need to ensure there is plenty of air in the CM. A pressure of 4.4 psi [30.3 kPa] is on the low side.</div>
003:49:37|The reason they are pressurising the LM at this point in the mission is to permit ejection from the S-IVB. In order to send the ejection command to the four support points where the LM is fixed to the S-IVB, two umbilicals within the tunnel must be connected. This requires opening the CM's forward hatch and going into the tunnel area, which must first be pressurised. But if the tunnel is pressurised, then so will the LM be pressurised owing to the open valves in the LM's overhead hatch.</div>
003:51:13|If they are pressurising the LM from CM air, then perhaps the flow of oxygen from the supply tanks into the cabin is higher than normal leading to an alarm being triggered.</div>
003:53:27|It is at about this point that a crewman, probably Neil given that he has just mentioned the view, takes two photographs of Earth half obscured by the structure of the Lunar Module.</div>
003:53:27|The second of these images shows enough of Earth's globe that a measurement can be taken to determine the distance to Earth at that moment. The calculation yields a value of about 18,700 km or 10,100 nautical miles. This calculation is the reason the image has been placed at this point in the journal.</div>
003:53:27|Although this image of Earth is incomplete, there is enough of the globe to allow a measurement to be taken across from limb to limb. A little analysis, including a few assumptions, then permits us to make an approximate calculation of the spacecraft's altitude when the photo was taken. By checking another high resolution scan from this film (in this case, AS11-36-5306 on mag N, scanned by JSC), the full height of a scanned frame was found to be 4,169 pixels. This represents 55.5 millimetres, the actual height of an image to the edge of the gate as measured on a negative from my contemporary Hasselblad 500C camera. This camera is of the same type and from the same era as the camera that was used to take these images. From this, we can calculate that one scanned pixel represents 0.013313 millimetres or 13.313 microns. We can use this to measure the diameter of Earth's image on the film.</div>
003:53:27|On frame 5326, the diameter of Earth's image was measured to be 3,059 pixels which implies that on the film itself, it was 40.72 mm across. On the assumption that the shot was taken using an 80-mm lens (as stated in the Apollo 11 photo catalogue), we can use an equation to determine the angle that Earth subtended to the camera. This is "angle = 2arctan(dimension/2 times focal length)". This works out at 28.56&deg;. Since we know Earth's radius to be 6,371 km, basic trigonometry gives us a distance of about 25,000 km. However, that is the distance to the limb, not to the sub-spacecraft point on Earth. For that we deduct the planet's radius which yields approximately 18,700 km.</div>
003:53:27|There are quite a few sources of error in this methodology. How accurate was my measurement of the camera's gate? The piece of film I used might have expanded or contracted when compared to when it was in my camera. Did the accuracy of the lens's geometry depend on where the image was? In other words, it is possible that the lens did not have a linear geometry. How accurately could the edge of Earth be defined on the scan? It was certainly a soft transition encompassing a few pixels and some sharpening was applied to give a better edge to measure against. Note also that the technique will yield more accurate answers when the photographs were taken near to Earth. Nevertheless, as the spacecraft continues its departure from Earth, this technique will give useful results and the calculation can be applied to all 49 images of Earth that show a measurable limb.</div>

004:46:15|Remembering that the Moon is moving around Earth at about 1 kilometre per second, Apollo 11's trajectory is designed to pass its leading hemisphere. Doing so will take energy out of the spacecraft's trajectory because the lunar gravity is acting in a retrograde fashion. In this special case, this will cause it to loop right around the far side of the Moon and return to the vicinity of Earth. The S-IVB on the other hand will be slowed down in its coast so that it reaches the Moon later than the spacecraft. Specifically it will pass the trailing hemisphere. In a sense, the Moon will be ahead of it in their orbits around Earth and the lunar gravity will pull on the stage. In effect, energy will be added to the S-IVB's orbit with the result that it will be thrown out of the Earth/Moon system altogether and end up in orbit around the Sun, where it remains to this day.</div>

005:35:34|Mike has just completed the star sightings for their second realignment of the guidance platform, an operation which he carried out using P52 on the computer. For this, he sighted on star 17 (Regor, Gamma Velorum) and star 34 (Atria, Alpha Trianguli Australis). These sightings indicated that across about 5 hours, the platform had drifted -0.172&deg; in X, -0.05&deg; in Y and 0.06&deg; in Z. The computer gave a star-angle difference value of 0.02&deg;. This is a comparison of the real angle between these two stars, and the measured angle. This value is acceptable.</div>
005:35:34|In the normal course of events, these values are left on the DSKY long enough for the engineers to copy them down from their telemetered copy of the display. However, in this instance, it is felt that the value for X is larger than expected (-0.172&deg; versus +0.018&deg;). Therefore Mission Control will get Mike to perform the P52 once more to check that an error in sighting hasn't crept in.</div>
005:37:31|TM is shorthand for telemetry; two syllables instead of four.</div>
005:39:43|Mike's second attempt at a P52 using the same stars, has yielded -0.171&deg; in X, -0.052&deg; in Y and 0.055&deg; in Z. The star-angle difference value is unchanged at 0.02&deg;. Since these values are very similar to the last, Mike will go ahead and torque the gimbals that support the platform to achieve realignment.</div>

006:00:02|Having successfully removed the Lunar Module from the Saturn S-IVB, Apollo 11 moves away from the spent rocket stage. The stage's APS engines have been fired one final time to put it safely out of the way, on a trajectory towards solar orbit. The White Team, overseen by Flight Director Eugene Kranz, is about to take over the flight control role at Houston from the Green Team, headed by Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth, who have handled the mission to this point.</div>
|Apollo 11 is now a complete spacecraft; the Command Service Module having docked to the Lunar Module which was then extracted from its launch position atop the last stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The joined craft have safely maneuvered away from the abandoned stage, which has been sent on a path towards solar orbit. Now the crew settle down to some navigation tasks, general house-keeping and eating. They will make a television transmission of views of the Earth from their window before retiring for the night.</div>
006:09:42|Mike is about to begin a navigation task while Apollo 11 is still relatively near Earth. It will require that he takes a series of measurements of the angle between Earth's horizon and a chosen star. This information will permit the computer to determine their state vector.</div>
006:09:42|As the spacecraft coasts between the two worlds of the Earth/Moon system, its position and its speed constantly change and both can be defined at any moment in time. Because they are both expressed within a three-dimensional frame of reference, we end up with three numbers for position and three for velocity, six numbers in all. Collectively, these are known as a state vector. Once the state vector of an object is known, its trajectory can be computed forward or backward in time with respect to the bodies that it travels among. So it is with Apollo 11. If its state vector is known for a particular moment in time, then it can be accurately navigated to reach the right place around the lunar far side from where they can enter lunar orbit.</div>
006:09:42|There are two means of determining the state vector. The primary method uses the permanent radio signal between Earth and the spacecraft. But in case this is lost, the crew have a backup method that uses the angles between either Earth or the Moon and a defined star to achieve the same thing. For this, Mike, the onboard navigator, will employ the spacecraft's sextant to superimpose the image of a star on the horizon of the nearest world, in this case. Earth. Doing so yields an angle between the two.</div>
006:09:42|Were they to view Earth as they head away, the home planet would be seen to appear to move against the background of stars. At a particular time, a measurement of Earth's apparent position against these stars will only be valid for a particular trajectory. In other words, measurements of the star-horizon angles will define a particular trajectory and therefore will yield their state vector.</div>
006:21:56|Gimbal lock is a notoriously tricky concept to describe as it requires some three-dimensional mental gymnastics. The problem stems from the fact that the guidance platform in the middle of the IMU was mounted within only three nested gimbals.</div>
006:21:56|As the outer gimbal rotates by virtue of being joined to the spacecraft, the three axes, and the degrees of freedom of rotation they provide, can accommodate such rotation in order to maintain the platform's orientation in space. However, should the outer gimbal rotate so far that the angle it makes with the middle gimbal becomes too great, thereby aligning its axis with that of the inner gimbal, then we get the condition known as gimbal lock.</div>
006:21:56|With gimbal lock, because two of the axes are lined up, we have essentially lost one of our degrees of freedom and the gimbals are no longer able to maintain the platform's orientation.</div>
006:21:56|Mike is using Auto Maneuver to orient the spacecraft as necessary for his P23 exercise. However, he has found that having the spacecraft take itself from one attitude to the other causes it to get near the gimbal lock condition. The attitudes that threaten gimbal lock are indicated on the Flight Director/Attitude Indicator (FDAI) by a red patch on the ball.</div>
006:21:56|Using the FDAI as a guide, Mike can manually control the attitude of the stack in order to keep well away from gimbal lock.</div>
006:25:47|In the final weeks before launch, the crew had stayed at crew quarters at KSC. Their food was served up by Lew Hartzell, a former tug-boat cook who catered for all the Apollo crews.</div>
006:35:01|Mike is working through his P23 navigation sightings. Having taken a mark on a star/horizon angle, he has the computer return two values on the DSKY as Noun 49. These are Delta-R and Delta V which represent the difference between his current state vector and the new one implied by this star/horizon measurement. Delta-R is the change in position (or range) and Delta-V is the change in the velocity values, both expressed as a vector sum of the component values. His concern is that while a Delta-V of zero indicates no change in the velocity values, the Delta-R value is a change in position of 879.3 nautical miles. Although this seems excessively large to him, Duke will soon reassure him that Mission Control believe they understand why it is happening.</div>
006:37:01|Mike will repeat the star/horizon angle measurement to see if he obtains a similar result.</div>
006:41:09|Mike has been comparing his new state vector with one that has been extrapolated from their time in Earth orbit. Since then, the S-IVB has carried out the TLI burn and small errors from before then have built up to appear large as they hurtle away from Earth.</div>
006:41:22|Mission Control maintains a primary version of the state vector in a reserved area of the computer's 2K-word memory. There is another reserved area, the LM slots, which, while docked, aren't used for anything, since the LM's state vector is the same as the CSM's. Indeed, the CSM state vector can be stored in the LM slots as a backup. It is only when the two vehicles are separated, and particularly during rendezvous that when the two are needed. Then, CSM sextant sightings plus VHF ranging will provide the information necessary to update the CSM's copy of the LM's state vector in the LM slots. This is essential for the CSM to understand where the LM is for validation LM burn solutions, and most importantly if the CSM has to perform any rescue manoeuvres. But in the meantime, the LM slots are available for Mike to store his version of the state vector during his P23 exercises.</div>
006:49:07|<b>From page 4-3 of the Pilots' report of the <span class="attribution">Apollo 11 Mission Report:</span></b> &quot;Two periods of cislunar midcourse navigation, using the command module computer program (P23), were planned and executed. The first, at 6 hours, was primarily to establish the apparent horizon altitude for optical marks in the computer. The first determination was begun at a distance of approximately 30,000 [nautical] miles [55,000 km], while the second, at 24 hours, was designed to accurately determine the optical bias errors. Excess time and fuel were expended during the first period because of difficulty in locating the substellar point of each star. Ground-supplied gimbal angles were used rather than those from the onboard computer. This technique was devised because computer solutions are unconstrained about the optics shaft axis; therefore, the computer is unable to predict if lunar module structure might block the line of sight to the star. The ground-supplied angles prevented lunar module structure from occulting the star, but were not accurate in locating the precise substellar point, as evidenced by the fact that the sextant reticle pattern was not parallel to the horizon. Additional maneuvers were required to achieve a parallel reticle pattern near the point of horizon-star superposition.&quot;</div>
007:33:21|Crews often found that if the Sun was impinging near the optics apertures, it could cause substantial flare within their optical paths. It is worth reminding ourselves how incredibly dim even the brightest stars are with respect to the Sun. Stars are virtually impossible to see when the eye is adapted to sunlight and it usually needs a period of adaptation to the dark to allow any but the bright stars to become visible.</div>
007:34:09|Star 44 is Enif or Epsilon Pegasi. Mike will instead use 45 which is Fomalhaut or Alpha Piscis Austrini.</div>
007:45:26|Mission Control can see that Mike has omitted to press the Proceed button on the DSKY, which commands the onboard computer to implement the required activity.</div>
008:04:08|Already on this flight, Mike has a history of betting with cups of coffee. During Earth orbit, <a href="02earth-orbit-tli.html#0005417" target="new">he mentioned a bet with Glenn Parker</a> about the quality of his star sightings.</div>
008:09:03|It is unclear exactly what Mike is seeing when he is taking his angular measurements. The following drawings are to try to visualise the view through the sextant. The reticle (or graticule) in these diagrams is based on a drawing in a 1967 training manual.</div>
008:09:03|This represents the ideal situation as Mike sees it. The central line should coincide with the tangent to Earth's horizon at the point where the star's image is superimposed. It can also be parallel to that tangent. This ensures that the angle being measured is to the substellar point.</div>
008:09:03|In this version of what might be happening, the central line is not tangential to the horizon but the star is aligned on both it and the horizon. This would appear to lead to a larger angle being measured.</div>
008:09:03|In this version, the central line is tangential to the horizon but not at the substellar point. The star is aligned on the horizon. This would also appear to lead to a larger angle being measured. There is another possibility which is similar to the last case but the star is placed on the line rather than the horizon. It will transpire that <a href="05day2-mcc.html#0240213" target="new">Mike is right</a> when they revisit the topic in the morning. The first of the above cases is how it should appear and his measurement will yield an incorrect angle.</div>
008:11:13|The explanation of the PTC REFSMMAT given above by the PAO is simplified. A REFSMMAT is a definition of a particular orientation in space, measured with respect to the stars. The PTC REFSMMAT is one to which the spacecraft's guidance platform is aligned. The spacecraft's attitude will therefore be measured against this reference, which has been chosen so that when the spacecraft is orientated to rotate broadside on to the Sun, it will do so without the platform going into gimbal lock.</div>
008:25:49|s Neil says, star 26 is Spica, or Alpha Virginis, and star 30 is Menkent, or Theta Centauri. Star 24 is Gienah, or Gamma Corvi.</div>
008:53:15|The Apollo 11 crew have handed over control of their onboard computer to Houston so that a new version of their state vector can be uploaded to the CSM slots in the computer's erasable memory. This state vector will be based on measurements made on Earth of their radio signal.</div>
009:01:06|Verb 66 instructs the computer to make a copy in the LM slots of the state vector that is in the CSM slots in memory.</div>
009:36:44|This is Mike's third opportunity to realign the guidance platform. In this case, he sighted on star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri) and star 32 (Alphecca, Alpha Coronae Borealis). Star 33 (Antares, Alpha Scorpii) was used as a check. The computer was commanded to steer the sextant to aim at Antares aa a check. After these marks, the platform was torqued to match the orientation defined in the PTC REFSMMAT that was recently uplinked to the computer. The star angle difference, a measure of the quality of Mike's sightings, was 0.01&deg;, a good result.</div>
009:41:07|It appears that having made the star sightings, Mike then directly torqued the platform around to the new orientation as per the PTC REFSMMAT. This meant that there was no determination of how much drift had occurred since the previous P52 4 hours earlier. On later flights (Apollo 14 onwards), it was normal that when changing the REFSMMAT, a note of the drift angles would be made using the old REFSMMAT, then torquing around to the new orientation.</div>
009:42:19|The four quad packages of thrusters that comprise the RCS are distributed around the girth of the Service Module, approximately around the CSM's centre of mass. They are labelled A to D. Normally, when attitude changes are made, opposite pairs are used so that the impulses are balanced, i.e. they are coupled to produce pure rotation with almost no translation. So A and C would fire together, or B and D.</div>
009:42:19|An issue with that is that each impulse comes from two RCS engines. On this occasion, for finer control of attitude they will use uncoupled thrusters, just one engine at a time. This is because they want to get the stack as stable as possible prior to spinning it around its long axis. Uncoupled thrusting will introduce small errors in their trajectory but tomorrow's midcourse correction manoeuvre and the tracking that will surround it will take that out.</div>
009:42:19|Based on measurements of scans of 70-mm magazine N, it appears that four photos of Earth are taken about now using the 80-mm lens. The calculated distance is roughly 87,000 km or 47,000 nautical miles.</div>
009:53:19|The lens on the Hasselblad camera is changed to a 250-mm telephoto and seven photos are taken on Mag N. The last four of these permit a distance calculation to be made of approximately 91,000 km or 49,000 nautical miles. The first three do not have enough of Earth's limb visible to make a distance determination but as they are virtually identical to the last four, they were evidently taken at the same time.</div>

010:35:55|The white spots refer to flaws in the television from Apollo 10 two months earlier. The Apollo TV cameras use electron beam vacuum tubes to create a picture. A photosensitive target has the optical image projected onto it. This target is at one end of a vacuum tube behind an optical glass window. At the opposite end is a hot wire that releases electrons. These are focussed into a beam of electrons which is then scanned across the target. The degree to which the electrons are accepted onto the plate depends on the charge that built up onto it due to the light. This way, the beam can be used to read out the image from the plate in a serial pattern, line by line. It is possible that damage or contamination of the target could cause errors in the read-out of the beam that would look like white spots.</div>
010:46:58|The Service Module has four cryogenic storage tanks; two for hydrogen and two for oxygen, both of which are required as reactants togenerate electrical power. The oxygen also supplies the crew with breathing air. Each tank is a double-walled, vacuum-insulated pressure vessel. Their contents are in a state known as supercritical, a combination of high pressure and cold temperature that renders the substance in a form rather like a dense fog. The systems that are fed by these tanks are designed assuming a high-pressure feed. However, as the reactants are removed, both the temperature and pressure will decrease. Steps therefore need to be taken to maintain a suitably high pressure and this is achieved using electrical heaters built into their interior. These can supply thermal energy that restores the pressure to an acceptable level. They can be controlled automatically using signals from pressure sensors, or manually with switches in the cabin.</div>
010:46:58|As heat leaks into the tank from outside, the density of the contents can be affected with the outer shell warming up slightly and becoming like a less dense layer surrounding more dense layers towards the centre of the tanks. This so-called stratification causes errors in the readings from the capacitance probes that run the width of the tank using electrical capacitance to measure quantity. To counter this effect, small fans are installed at either end of the heating assembly. these can be turned on to stir the tanks' contents and disturb any stratification.</div>
010:46:58|One of the oxygen tanks aboard Apollo 13 famously exploded when the operation of the fans led to an electrical short and a fire that ran out of control. The incident led to changes in subsequent Service Modules which included no longer using fans in the oxygen tanks.</div>

011:03:56|Within the three fuel cells in the Service Module, hydrogen and oxygen are reacted together through an electrolyte in order to create electricity. Additional products include water pure enough to drink which is also used to help cool the spacecraft through the process of evaporation. Waste heat is also generated which is dissipated through a series of radiators arranged around the top of the Service Module. Impurities in the reactants, chiefly argon, can build up within the fuel cells which can impede the reaction. This necessitated periodic flushing or purging of such contaminant by briefly increasing the flow of reactant. In general, oxygen purges were carried out daily and hydrogen purges were every two days.</div>
011:18:49|One of the problems that stemmed from the use of fuel cells to make their electricity and their water was that the water supply had a large amount of hydrogen gas dissolved in it. To fix the problem, they used a gas separator, a cylindrical device about 15 centimetres or 6 inches long which was connected in series with the hose that delivered their water. Within a slotted stainless steel cylinder, there was a tube of Teflon membrane through which the water passed. The membrane was hydrophobic, whereby it allowed gas to pass through but not water, as long as the outside of the membrane was not wet. The gas could then leave through the slots in the metal cylinder. The water continued to the end of the Teflon tube where it met a steel mesh that had been treated to be hydrophilic, easily passing water but impeding the gas.</div>

021:38:00|At some point between 10 and 30 hours, Buzz begins to transmit video to Earth. This clip is kindly donated by Mark Gray.</div>
021:38:00|<a href="video/a11-untimed-022-approx.mp4" target="new">H.264 MP4 video file.</a></div>
022:55:09|In the middle of this pause, there seems to be some very low-level modulation that might be Buzz trying to talk on the air/ground.</div>
023:07:42|TM is short for telemetry. Aldrin and Mission Control are essentially comparing readings of the same parameter.</div>
023:18:40|Based on measurements of Earth's image on the scanned film of Hasselblad magazine N, it is likely that four photographs were taken around this time; three in quick succession and the fourth a few minutes later.</div>
023:18:40|By measuring the rotation of the planet between this next image and the previous, it appears that 5355 was taken about 13 minutes later.</div>
024:04:25|When Mike attempted to carry out a navigation exercise before their sleep period, it didn't go too well. The idea was that he would manoeuvre the spacecraft in order to aim the sextant's fixed line of sight at Earth's horizon. More specifically, Mission Control had given him accurate attitude angles that ought to have placed this at the substellar point, a point that is the nearest or furthest point on the planet's limb from the star with which the angle is being measured.</div>
024:04:25|After the <a href="04nav-housekeep.html#0080838" target="new">exercise</a>, Mike complained that Mission Control's values were not taking him to the substellar point, implying that an inaccuracy had crept into the system somewhere.</div>
024:11:33|Mike is carrying out a realignment of the spacecraft's guidance platform using Program 52 in the computer. The two stars that he will use are star 36 (Vega, Alpha Lyrae) and 37 (Nunki, Sigma Sagittarii). His accuracy in this instance is excellent as shown by a display of 'all balls' for Noun 05, the star angle difference. This is a comparison of the actual and measured angles between these two stars. From these sightings, he determines how far the platform has drifted since the last P52 15 hours ago. The values he will come up with, in Noun 93, are -0.493&deg; in X, -0.191&deg; in Y and -0.024&deg; in Z.</div>
024:19:59|During periods of no communication, when there is good reception from the spacecraft, it is not unusual for a little of the crew's conversation to break through onto the radio link, though very distorted. One instance of this prompts McCandless to think that the crew were calling.</div>
024:25:08|To take the PAO's explanation further, star 40 is Altair (Alpha Aquilae). With a newly aligned platform and a fresh state vector, the spacecraft's computer should be well-placed to calculate an accurate attitude to aim the sextant's fixed line of sight at the substellar point for the coming P23 cislunar navigation exercise.</div>
024:25:08|McCandless has asked for a Verb 66 which is an instruction to make a copy of the state vector that is in the CSM slots of the computer and put it in the LM slots. That will then become the starting point for Mike's P23 determination of the state vector.</div>
024:29:33|Noun 87 presents the optics calibration data. Having 'zeroed the optics' which brings the shaft angle to its centre, zero-degrees parking position, the procedure requires that a star be viewed through the sextant's fixed line of sight (known as LLOS or Landmark Line Of Sight in the documentation). The trunnion angle is then reduced to bring the image of the same star through the Star Line Of Sight (SLOS) to be superimposed on the LLOS image. In this condition, both the shaft angle and the trunnion angle ought to be zero; in other words, reading five balls on the first two register displays of the DSKY.</div>
024:32:22|When the CMP measures the angle between a star and a planet's horizon, he has to tell the computer whether he's measuring to the horizon nearest the star or furthest from the star. This is required because only one horizon will be visible depending on which side of the planet is illuminated by the Sun. Star 01 is Alpheratz (Alpha Andromedae).</div>
024:43:04|The sextant's arrangement has a fixed line of sight which can be rotated 360&deg; around a shaft, giving the shaft angle. When it does so, it takes with it a tilting prism arrangement that yields a moveable line of sight superimposed upon it. This latter axis derives it name from the supporting cylinders that emanate from the sides of an old-fashioned cannon to allow it to pivot in altitude. Those cylinders were known as trunnions and engineers took this term for the sextant's tilting arrangement and therefore we get a trunnion angle for the star line of sight which can be up to 50&deg; away from the fixed line of sight. The sextant's optical magnification is 28 times, which makes it an excellent instrument with which to study the now distant Earth.</div>
024:48:04|The attitude angles that the onboard computer came up with to aim the fixed line of sight at the substellar point on Earth's horizon, also happened to hide Alpheratz behind the LM, which perhaps says a litle about the lack of sophistication of the CMC's software. It is worth noting that with the objectives of the optics being mounted on the upper part of the CM's conical surface, the LM actually obscures a substantial amount of their field of view.</div>
025:07:05|Strictly speaking, it is the difference in pressure between the tunnel and the CM cabin. However, since a valve in the LM's overhead hatch has been deliberately left open, the reading will reflect the pressure in the LM cabin also. Note that the pressure gauge that Mike is reading is only connected across either side of the forward hatch when the Tunnel Vent Valve is in its &quot;LM/CM Delta-P&quot; position. If the valve is in any other position, then the gauge reading is meaningless.</div>
025:07:05|In Mission Control, the backup commander of Apollo 11, Jim Lovell, has temporarily taken the CapCom position.]</div>
025:43:56|Verb 59 means 'Please calibrate'.</div>
025:48:24|When water is dumped from the spacecraft, it has a tiny propulsive effect that affects the spacecraft's trajectory. Mission Control want the dump to go ahead soon so that radio tracking after the burn will be inclusive of the dump's effects. MCC number 2 in the Flight Plan will in fact be the first Midcourse Correction actually carried out, because MCC-1 was deemed unnecessary and was cancelled.</div>
025:52:19|An interpretation of the PAD follows.<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This burn is to correct the spacecraft's trajectory at the second opportunity given in the Flight Plan. The first opportunity was not used.<br> <b>System:</b> The burn would be made with the SPS engine under the control of the Guidance and Navigation System.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,059 pounds (28,603 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> +0.97&deg; and -0.20&deg;.<br> <b>Time of ignition, T<sub>IG</sub> (Noun 33):</b> 26 hours, 44 minutes, 57.92 seconds Ground Elapsed Time.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +11.8 (+3.6); y, -0.3 (-0.1); z, +17.7 (+5.4).

The weight of the LM is 33,302 pounds (15,106 kg).
025:59:58|It is unclear what Buzz means by 'P23 damage'. A possibility is that Mike is looking to see how his copy of the state vector, the one in the LM slots, has changed with his sightings.</div>
026:00:00|In other words, a mere 3-second burn of the SPS engine at this stage of the coast will change the height at which they pass above the Moon's far side by over 200 kilometres, an illustration of the sensitivity of celestial mechanics.</div>
026:07:51|As they manoeuvre, the signal from the spacecraft weakens and becomes noisier.</div>
026:07:51|Come the time of the midcourse correction burn, it is vital that the spacecraft be in the correct attitude so that the force applied by the engine will be in the right direction. As a check of their attitude, the manoeuvre PAD included a star, number 30 (Menkent, Theta Centaurus) that ought to be in the sextant's field of view when the spacecraft is properly orientated and the instrument's shaft and trunnion angles are as prescribed.</div>
026:10:38|The crew switch their communications to operate through one of the Command Module's omnidirectional antenna, Omni A.</div>
026:46:13|The normal range for combustion pressure (i.e. the pressure in the combustion chamber as a result of burning) is 95 to 105 psi (655 to 724 kPa).</div>
026:50:06|This is the Delta-V counter mounted on the EMS panel. It was set to the value of Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, 16.8, as given in the PAD. As the short burn progressed, this counter took the output from the EMS's accelerometer and used it to count down towards zero, whereupon it sent a shutdown command to the engine. The value was deliberately less than the actual desired Delta-V<sub>T</sub> (total) of 21.3 to account for the engine's tail-off thrust, the impulse supplied by the engine after the shutdown command.</div>
027:07:42|Image measurement and triangulation suggests that two photographs are taken around this time.</div>
027:16:10|When the spacecraft is in a relatively stable attitude, communications are usually via the High Gain Antenna as long as Earth is within the range of its articulation. This dish antenna can automatically track a ground station by sensing when it is going slightly off track. If the spacecraft is rolling in its Passive Thermal Control mode, a set of four omnidirectional antennae mounted at 90&deg; intervals around the periphery of the CM are brought into play. Normally only two of these antennae are used; B and D on opposite sides of the spacecraft, but these have to be switched every 10 minutes as the spacecraft rotates. It is possible for Mission Control to remotely switch the antenna but often they request that the crew carry make the switch.</div>
027:22:41|The specular reflection of the Sun off the ocean surface is a phenomenon that artists depicting Earth prior to the Moon flights usually failed to portray.</div>
027:28:13|Jim Lovell is referring to his and Buzz's flight in Gemini 12.</div>
027:47:46|<a href="04nav-housekeep.html#0110621" target="new">Prior to their sleep period</a>, Mission Control had notified the crew of some 'funnies' regarding the transducer that measures the flow of oxygen into the cabin. The flow of oxygen is not only necessary to keep the spacecraft pressurised against leaks and its consumption by the crew, it is also being use to gradually flush nitrogen from the cabin. At launch, the cabin was filled with a 60/40 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. As they ascended through the atmosphere, the mixture began to be dumped overboard until the cabin had reached about 5 psi (35 kPa), a third of sea level pressure. As the mission continues the remaining nitrogen will gradually be replaced with pure oxygen.</div>
028:36:15|The Command Module has four low-gain omnidirectional antennae spaced around its periphery, designated A to D, which can be used instead of the High Gain Antenna. As the spacecraft revolves, the crew can maintain communication by manually selecting whichever Omni is facing Earth. Additionally, Mission Control can remotely switch between antennas B and D on the crew's behalf.</div>
028:39:21|As Buzz talks to Mission Control, music can be faintly heard in the background each time he keys his microphone. Your lowly editor had determined that the crew are listening to 'Angel of the Morning' by Merrillee Rush and the Turnabouts which was a hit in 1968.</div>
028:42:31|Image measurement and triangulation suggests that four photographs are taken around this time.</div>
029:20:00|There are no communciations with Apollo 11 for 50 minutes, while the crew have lunch. In the next chapter, they resume viewing the Earth as the spacecraft rotates in Passive Thermal Control mode.</div>
|The crew of Apollo 11 continue with housekeeping duties on their spacecraft systems, and in between times observe and photograph the Earth. They make a television broadcast of the view, and also show the interior of the Command Module.</div>
029:32:14|The Apollo 11 stack is currently in its barbecue roll mode, more formally known as Passive Thermal Control. This is in order to distribute the heating effect of the Sun and the cooling effect of space across the spacecraft's exterior. The rate of rotation is 0.3&deg; per second and this was set up using a value stored in the computer. According to McCandless, this value, and another for the deadband (the allowed tolerance in attitude before active correction occurs), both have been set to low values due to the crew using another program. Normally, this would cause the RCS thrusters to fire frenetically as they react to the new parameters. Specifically, the spacecraft would be made to stop rotating and then hold its orientation within a narrow tolerance (probably &plusmn;0.5&deg;). However, at this time, the thrusters have been disabled so the spacecraft will continue to rotate.</div>
029:40:00|Based on image measurement and triangulation, it appears that AS11-36-5362 is taken around this time.</div>
030:00:00|The PAO announcer will shortly correct his figure for the distance from Earth, these figures being referenced to the Moon.</div>
030:00:00|Apollo 11 has passed the halfway point in its journey in terms of distance and the Public Affairs Officer has corrected his error. Readers may note that an Earth-referenced velocity is different to a Moon-referenced velocity. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is coasting towards a moving target - the Moon.</div>
030:17:05|At <a href="04nav-housekeep.html#0105929" target="new">010:59:29</a>, Mission Control read up a set of abort PADs that could be used at various points during the coast out to the Moon to bring the crew home expeditiously. The data in these PADs would be used by program 37 to calculate the details of the burn. The names for the PADs were given with reference to TLI and and the first of those opportunities has already passed. Each PAD included a value for Delta-V<sub>T</sub> which is the total required change in velocity to make a safe return at that time. Having recently burned a midcourse correction manoeuvre, the Delta-V values for the remaining PADs have changed slightly.</div>
030:27:55|The crew begins to transmit television signals, even though they do not currently have the High Gain Antenna deployed. Therefore, when the signal from the current omnidirectional antenna reaches Earth, it is very low level and therefore noisy. Although the image is quite broken and torn, it is clearly showing the green displays from one of the CM's DSKY units.</div>

031:13:28|As the spacecraft rotates, the presentation of the current omnidirectional antenna changes. Although there are four such antennae spaced around the periphery of the CM, adequate coverage can be achieved with just two on opposite sides.</div>
031:14:37|TV transmission ends.</div>
031:19:33|One of the major components of the guidance system is the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This basketball-size piece of kit contains a platform that is stabilised by gyroscopes. This carries a set of three orthogonally-mounted accelerometers. The gyroscopes resist any change in the orientation of their rotation axis and when this happens, they generate an error signal that can be used to return them to their starting point. The gimbals within which the platform is mounted are motorised to achieve this. But the process is not perfect and even the best mechanical gyroscope stabilising system is prone to a small amount of drift in its orientation. For this reason, Mike makes regular checks comparing the platform's alignment with the stars to ensure it is orientated just as it ought to be.</div>
031:19:33|Accelerometers on the platform measure changes in the spacecraft's velocity that are due to any kind of propulsive impulse; mostly engine burns. They do not measure changes brought about during free fall, when the spacecraft is on a ballistic path. An accelerometer will also suffer from slight imperfections in its ability to measure and this usually appears as a small bias in its output that can be compensated for.</div>
032:27:50|Mike has realised that as the spacecraft continues to rotate in its barbecue roll, it will come upon the correct roll angle required for the TV transmission quite naturally. Pitch and yaw are already correct. This attitude will allow the HGA to directly face Earth as well as making the planet visible in one of their large windows. Additionally, from an earlier exchange, he knows that the computer's deadband tolerance is narrow and that the roll rate for the barbecue mode is zero. The spacecraft is only still turning because the thrusters have been disabled. Therefore if he re-enables the thrusters as they reach a roll angle of 261&deg;, then the computer should bring them to a stop at near enough the correct attitude.</div>
032:27:50|One problem with this arrangement is that the jet firings are uncoupled. That is, a rotation might be initiated by a single thruster but the direction of that thrust does not act through the spacecraft's centre of mass. Therefore some of the force acts to rotate the spacecraft, but some acts to translate the spacecraft (i.e. like a propulsive manoeuvre) and this affects the trajectory.</div>
032:43:23|Based on image measurement and triangulation, three photos of Earth appear to have been taken around this time, AS11-36-5369 to 5371.</div>

033:37:50|Sir Bernard Lovell (1913-2012) was a British physicist who established a radio astronomy in Cheshire, England, where he arranged the construction of what was then the world's largest steerable radio telescope that now bears his name, the 76.2-metre (250-foot) Lovell Telescope. During the early years of space flight, Lovell and his team often tracked spacecraft on their journeys to the moon and planets, on occasion intercepting image transmissions and helping to have them published before the craft's own agencies had done so.</div>

034:07:03|Eidophor was a video projection system that was used in Mission Control for one of the large display screens at the front of the MOCR. It used a slowly rotating disk on which was deposited a film of oil. A scanning electron beam wrote the TV image onto that oil film, causing it to become transparent in some areas. Light was then shone through the film on its way to a screen, as in a conventional projector.</div>

034:17:45|Duke's rainbow refers to the colours that become visible on the TV picture when the content moves across the field of view at speed. They are an artefact of the way that the camera works. At the moment, the camera is being moved about at speed.</div>
034:17:45|In order to save weight in the TV camera, its designers used just one imaging tube whereas a conventional colour TV camera of the time had three (or even four) tubes, one each to image the three primary colours; red, green and blue (and maybe one for fine detail) simultaneously. Having just one imaging tube meant that the three colours were imaged sequentially by rotating a filter wheel in front of the sensor. In this arrangement, each television field (of which there were 60 per second) represented the analysis of the scene in red, then blue, then green, over and over. When the signal reached Earth, engineers would pass it through equipment to reconstruct a full colour signal from these fields. A disadvantage of this was that if anything moved quickly across the field of view, then the separate colour analyses would become visible.</div>

034:30:39|The conversion of the spacecraft's sequential colour TV signal to composite colour as used by the TV networks was convoluted. The analogue TV systems at the time were very intolerant of timing errors on the signals and those from the fast-moving spacecraft were particularly excessive. The solution adopted was to record the incoming TV signal onto a broadcast-quality quadruplex videotape recorder. The take-up reel was replaced by a looping system which provided a buffer of tape before it was then fed to a second videotape machine. The first machine was locked to the synchronising pulses in the spacecraft's TV signal. The second was locked to a master clock at the TV electronics site on Earth. Having sorted out the timing issues, a magnetic disc system was used to temporarily store the sequential colour fields so that they would be read out available simultaneously and thereby put together into a standard composite TV signal.</div>

The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable. If this abort burn were to be made, the apogee of the resulting orbit would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> 22.1 nautical miles (40.9 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects the Earth's atmosphere. What this really means is that the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 7.8 fps (2.4 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 1 second.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 3.4 fps (1 m/s). Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the engine in case the G&amp;N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, is slightly lower than Delta-V<sub>T</sub> because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 1 (Alpheratz, Alpha Andromedae) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 218.5&deg; and 22.7&deg; respectively. This is part of an attitude check.<br> <b>Boresight star:</b> Not available. This is a second attitude check which is made by sighting on another celestial object with the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight).<br> The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. Another important point is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g's.<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 2.65&deg; south, 165.0&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.<br> <b>Range to go:</b> 1,189.9 nautical miles (2,203.7 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after Entry Interface.<br> <b>Expected velocity at Entry Interface:</b> 36,228 fps (11,042 m/s).<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 144 hours, 56 minutes and 47 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft would be at 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are the north set, Deneb and Vega. The align angles are roll, 7&deg;; pitch, 144&deg;; yaw, 68&deg;.<br> The PAD includes some additional notes. The SPS propellant tanks are full, so there would be no need to perform an ullage burn to settle their contents. The burn details assume the LM is still docked and the attitude values are based on the guidance platform being aligned per the PTC REFSMMAT.]
035:17:53|Verb 16 Noun 20 will reveal the current gimbal angles from the IMU, essentially the spacecraft's attitude in hundredths of a degree with respect to the current REFSMMAT. Noun 22 is for new angles so it seems he is to copy the current angles into a slot for new angles.</div>
