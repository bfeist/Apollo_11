-041739|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We're in a built-in hold at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. We expect to resume our countdown at about 48 minutes from this time at 6:02am, Eastern Daylight Time. All elements of the Apollo 11 countdown are GO at this time. We're heading for a planned liftoff on the Apollo 11 mission at 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The prime crew for Apollo 11 is Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin. Were awakended ... just about an hour ago, at 4:15am, Eastern Daylight. At this time, after successfully completing a ... determination, they're sitting down for breakfast. The breakfast menu, the usual astronaut fare on launch day, of orange juice, tenderloin steak, scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee. Joining the prime crew for breakfast are two members of the Apollo 11 team who have worked with the astronauts during their preperation. The first is the Director of Flight Crew Operations, the astronauts Bob Donald K. Slayton, and the second member joining the crew for breakfast, astronaut Bill Anders. Bill Anders has served as the backup Command Module Pilot during all preparations for the Apollo 11 mission. Anders, of course, did fly the 3rd seat on the first mission - manned mission to the moon, Apollo 8 back last December. Anders was a member of that crew. Astronaut, Bill Anders also shortly will assume the position as Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics Space Council. So, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and Backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders having breakfast with the prime crew at this time. Following breakfast, the crew will go into their final preparations donning their space suits. They're not expected to depart from their crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre for the trip to the launch pad for another hour and 10 minutes or so. Meanwhile, here in Firing Room 1 at the Launch Control Centre Complex 39, all going well as the team here in the firing room continues to monitor the status of all the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle during this phase of the built-in hold. Shortly, a close-out crew of four crewmembers will be sent to the pad, they will go up to the 320-foot level where the Apollo 11 Command Module is located, and proceed to open the hatch of the spacecraft which has been closed during the propellant loading phase of the launch vehicle. The crew, which includes the astronaut, Fred Hayes, will then make some preliminary preparations for the arrival of the prime crew for Apollo 11 who will come aboard later in the count. That is our status at this time, once again to repeat: the astronauts now sitting down for breakfast having their usual breakfast of steak and scrambled eggs. Joining them, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, and the backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Bill Anders. We're still in our planned built-in hold, 3 hours and 30 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-040058|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We remain in our built-in hold on the Apollo 11 countdown of T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. We plan to resume the count at two minutes after the hour. All elements of the Apollo 11 countdown are proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin, winding up breakfast at this point in their crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre. They're joined for breakfast by Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, and Bill Anders, the backup Command Module Pilot. Before proceeding to breakfast and sitting down for the usual astronaut menu on launch day of steak and scrambled eggs, the crew underwent a brief physical examination by doctors Allan C. Harder and John Teegan. The crew was described as appearing to be rested, fit as a fiddle, and ready to go. Here in the firing room of Complex 39, the crew continuing to monitor the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We've loaded more than 3/4 of a million gallons of liquid oxygen / liquid hydrogen aboard the three stages of the Saturn V since the countdown resumed late last evening. Weather forecast also very acceptable for a launch attempt this morning. The forecast called for scattered clouds at altitudes about 15000 feet in the Kennedy Space Centre area. Visibility will be 10-15 miles. Winds in the launch area at launch time, from the southeast at 5-10 knots. The sea state off Cape Kennedy is satisfactory. And weather in round the world track, the various contingency areas required during the powered phase of the mission, all weather conditions acceptable around the track. We are GO, but we remain in our planned, built-in hold at this time. The astronauts, according to the countdown procedures, should be ready to depart from their crew quarters at about 6:25am Easter Daylight this morning to start the 8-mile trip to their spacecraft located on the 320-foot level at the launchpad. We're at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes of our built-in hold. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-035056|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We remain in our built-in hold on the Apollo 11 countdown of T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes, and holding. Expecting to resume the count now about 22 minutes from this time at 2 minutes past the hour. All aspects of the countdown remain in a GO condition at this time. Latest report from the crew quarter here at the Kennedy Space Centre, the prime crew, astronauts Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin have completed their breakfast and are proceeding to the suit room which is on the west side of the crew quarters in the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at KSC. Shortly, they'll be donning their flight suits and going through the regular checkouts of the suits in preparation for the departure to the launch pad. Which, according to the countdown schedules, shortly after 6:25am Eastern Daylight Time. In preparation for the crew departure the test supervisor, Bill Schick, gave a GO for the closeout crew to proceed to the launch pad. This is a team of 4 individuals who will go up to the 320-foot level at the pad itself where the Apollo 11 spacecraft hatch is located. This hatch has been closed during the propelland loading procedures that have been in progress for most of the morning. The closeout crew consists of the pad leader, a Command Module technician, a quality control specialist, and the backup Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Fred Hayes. Shortly after the hatch is opened astronaut Hayes will go aboard and make some preliminary checks in preparation for the arrival of the prime crew. Here in the firing room we continue to monitor the status of more that 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants that have been brought onboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. The propellant loading one of the major milestones over the final portions of the count--at least over the last 9 hours. This has been the major task that's been in progress since the count was resumed late last evening. All aspects of Apollo 11 countdown proceeding satisfactorily as we remain in our planned built-in hold at T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-033100|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, but we are about to resume our count shortly. We expect to resume the count a little less than one minute from this time. We have been in a planned built-in hold of 1 hours and 32 minutes duration and it appears that all aspects of the mission are ready to resume the Apollo 11 countdown shortly, now about 25 seconds away. The crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin in the suit room at the crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre donning and checking out the pressure suits. At the launch pad at the 320-foot level, the hatch of the Apollo 11 Command Module was opened about 10 minutes ago. The backup Lunar Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Hayes, expected to go aboard the spacecraft shortly to make some preliminary checks. We're going to resume our count shortly.|P
-033001|PAO|MARK. T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and counting. We're counting on Apollo 11. All elements GO at this time. Aiming for a planned liftoff at 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. The astronaut crew expected to depart from their quarters about 24-25 minutes from this time to start the 8-mile trip to the launch pad. They'll be boarding the spacecraft starting at about the 2 hour, 40 minute mark of the count. All is GO with Apollo 11 at this time at 2 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-031600|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We just past the 3 hour, 16 minute mark in our countdown and we are proceeding at this time. Kennedy Control Centre launch team continuing to monitor the status of the various propellants now all aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The Apollo 11 prime crew of astronauts Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin finishing up their preparations in the suit room on the west side of the crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre. If the count continues to go well, I suspect that the astronauts will depart the building some 10 minutes or so from this time to start the 8-mile trip to the launch pad--going up to the 320-foot level at the pad, the location of the hatch for their Command Module. This is Kennedy Launch Contro, T-minus 3 hours, 15 minutes, 3 seconds and counting.|P
-030436|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 4 minutes, 32 seconds and counting. Right on time as far as the astronaut's countdown is concerned, the prime crew now departing from their crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and then counting Michael Collins plus the two technicians and Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton now boarding the transfer van for the trip to the launch pad. Slayton, actually, will drop off from the transfer van as it passes by here at the Launch Control Centre. The trip in the transfer van should take some 15 minutes to reach the pad, at which time the crew will board the first of two elevators for the trip to the 320 foot level at the launch pad where they will then proceed to ingress the spacecraft. At the present time, the backup Lunar Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Hayes, is already aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft performing some preliminary checks. This work includes checking the chlorine content of the water supply and adjusting the cabin lights inside the spacecraft in preparation for the arrival. We logged the departure from the building at about 6:27am Eastern Daylight Time. The transfer van now departing from the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at the Kennedy Space Centre on the start of it's 8-mile trip to launch pad A here at complex 39 where the Saturn V launch vehicle, now fully loaded with propellants and the spacecraft going through preliminary checkouts. Right now our count at 3 hours 3 minutes and counting aiming toward the planned liftoff time at 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. This is launch control.|P
-030059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 3 hours, 1 minute and counting. We are proceeding with the Apollo 11 countdown at this time. The prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin on the way to the launch pad in their transfer van. Just about 4 minutes ago the crew boarded the transfer van at their crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Centre to start the trip of about 8 miles to launch pad A, and finally to the 320-foot level above the launcher where their Command Module is located and where they will start a boarding process into the spacecraft at about 2 hours and 40 minutes in the count. Weather conditions are GO for the launch, astronauts on their way to the launch pad, the crew here in the firing room continuing to monitor the status of almost a million gallons of propellants that are aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle at this time. We're continuing to replenish the supply of the oxygen and hydrogen as we continue down the count. 2 hours, 59 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. This is Kenndy Launch Control.|P
-024600|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 2 hours, 45 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. As the prime crew for the mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin are on the ... part of their trip to the launch pad in the transfer van--it's now making the curve toward the pad, we have discovered a problem at the launch pad itself as the crew is about to arrive. We have a leak in a valve located in a system associated with replenishing liquid hydrogen for the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This is a piece of ground support equipment, actually. It is not on the rocket itself. It's located on the tower of the mobile launcher at the 200-foot level. This valve is leaking. We had a problem with this same valve during our countdown demonstration test previously. We have sent a team of three technicians and a safety man to the pad and these technicians are now tightening bolts around the valve. Once the technicians depart, we will send hydrogen again through this system to assure that the leak has been corrected. The astronauts are now coming up toward the pad itself as the crew of several technicians at the 200-foot level proceed to tighten some bolts around a leaking valve. Once again, this valve is associated with the system that replenishes liquid hydrogen for the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Because of the extremely low temperatures of the hydrogen, it continues to boil off during these phases of the count, and we continue to replenish this supply down the final moments of the count to assure that we have 100% aboard. The crew is working on the valve at this time--the crew went in a short time ago, and they're going to be followed shortly by the astronaut team which has just arrived at the pad--the transfer van now backing up toward the elevator. In a matter of 5 minutes or so, we'll be ready for the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong to come across the sil at the 320-foot level. That is our status at 2 hours, 43 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is launch control.|P
-024044|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 40 minutes, 40 seconds and counting. At this time, the prime crew for Apollo 11 has boarded the high-speed elevator from inside the A-level in the mobile launcher, which is the second level inside the launcher. This is a high-speed elevator, 600 feet-per-minute, which will carry them to the 320 foot level, the spacecraft level. Shortly, we'll expect astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to come across swing-arm 9, the Apollo access arm, and proceed to the white room and standby to board the spacecraft. The third member of the crew, astronaut Edwin Aldrin, will be the last one to board the spacecraft, will standby in the elevator seated in a chair, while his two comrades first board the spacecraft. Once Armstrong, who sits in the left-hand seat, and Collins who will sit in the right-hand seat during liftoff are aboard, then Aldrin will be called and he will take his seat--the middle seat in the spacecraft. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong and the Command Module Pilot, Michael Collins now proceeding across the swing-arm into the small white room that attaches at the spacecraft level. In the mean time, about 100 feet below, we have a technician--a team of technicians working on a leaking valve which is a part of the ground support equipment, a part of the system that's used to replenish the fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. He is proceeding to tighten a series of bolts around this valve in the hope that this will correct the leak. Once the technicians do depart, the hydrogen will again be flowed through the system to assure that the leak has been corrected. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, and CMP--the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins now standing by in the white room. T-minus 2 hours 38 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Launch Control.|P
-023448|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 34 minutes, 44 seconds and counting. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong now aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft at the 320 foot level, at the pad. We had it logged, having the commander going over the sill, into the cabin at 6:54am, Eastern Daylight. Since that time, the commander has now been tied into the system and has checked in over the communication lines. He was wished a good morning by the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, and Armstrong in return said "it looks like a good morning". In the mean time, 120 feet below him, the technicians continuing to work to tighten bolts around a leaking valve associated with the system that replenishes hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage. To repeat once again, this is not a problem with the launch vehicle itself, but on the ground support equipment associated with it. T-minus 2 hours 33 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-023058|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. Right on the hour, the Command Module Pilot, astronaut Michael Collins, who will be sitting on the right-hand side of the spacecraft during liftoff, boarded the spacecraft. We have it logged at 7:00am, Eastern Daylight Time. The 3rd member of the crew, Buzz Aldrin, standing by in the elevator around the corner along the swing-arm from the white room and the spacecraft at the 320 foot level. 120 feet below, technicians still working on some bolts that surround a leaking value that is associated with a system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel supply for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V rocket. Our countdown proceeding at this time coming up to the 2 minute - 30 second - the 2 hour, and 30 minute mark in the count. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-022352|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 23 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. The 3rd member of the Apollo 11 prime crew, now aboard the spacecraft. We had it logged at 7:07am Eastern Daylight Time when astronaut Buzz Aldrin boarded the spacecraft. He will sit in the middle seat during liftoff. As Lunar Module Pilot, his normal position would be on the right-hand side. However, due to crew preference we have the Command, of course, Neil Armstrong sitting on the left-hand side, the Lunar Module Pilot for the overall flight, Buzz Aldrin, sitting in the middle seat, and the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, sitting in the right-hand seat at liftoff. Down below at the 200-foot level, are technicians still hard at work at tightening bolts around a valve associated with the system that replenishes the hydrogen fuel for the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This is ground support equipment located on the tower at the pad at the 200-foot level. He continues to work at the 200-foot level as the crew in the white room does the same with the three astronauts aboard. We actually have a 4th astronaut still aboard the spacecraft at this time, astronaut Fred Haise who is the backup Command Module Pilot. He is in the lower equipment bay of the spacecraft giving a helping hand to the three prime crewmen as they start to perform some of their preliminary checks here as we head down over the final 2 hours - 2 1/2 hours of the countdown. We're at T-minus 2 hours, 22 minutes, 11 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-022059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 2 hours, 21 minute mark in our coutdown, and we are proceeding at this time. At the 320-foot level, all three astronauts now aboard the spacecraft. Just a few minutes ago, astronaut Buzz Aldrin came in and took the center seat to join Neil Armstrong on the left, and Mike Collins on the right. These are the positions they will fly at liftoff. During the process of getting the astronauts checked in to the spacecraft, communication cables must be attached to their suits. They also have to hook into the suit circuit system of the spacecraft that brings oxygen into their suits. They are helped by a fourth astronaut onboard, the backup Command Module Pilot, astronaut Fred Haise, is in the lower equipment bay, and one of the suit technicians who's located behind them, to give a hand as they check in. We've heard from Neil Armstrong and now we've also heard from Mike Collins on comm checks, and we're standing by for further reports as checkout continues. 120 feet down, the work continues on a leaky valve on the 200-foot level. This is ground support equipment - the technicians still hard at work tightening bolts around that valve at this time. 2 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-021040|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 10 minutes, 35 seconds and counting. At the 320-foot level, the 4th astronaut aboard the spacecraft regretfully leaves at this time. Astronaut, Fred Haise, is about to come out after giving the three prime crewmen a hand in their preliminary checkouts aboard. Haise will be coming out shortly. In the mean time, 120 feet below, where we had that problem with the leaky valve, the technicians have completed their work and they are in the process now of departing from the launch pad. In a short while we'll start flowing hydrogen again, back through the general replenishing system to continue to off up the supply of the hydrogen fuel in the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong, has completed a series of checks called Abort Advisory System checks. This is where certain key crewmen on the ground, members of the launch team, can send signals to the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft - light cues that would indicate difficulty during the flight in which he could take abort action if he determined that such action was necessary. These checks have been completed and Neil Armstrong confirm that the lights came on in the console in front of him - the panel in front of him as these lights were operated from the ground here in the Launch Control Center. All still going well with our count, we will standby as we again, bring hydrogen back to the 3rd stage, we will see how that operates, we're now at 2 hours, 9 minutes, 4 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-020704|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 2 hours, 7 minutes and counting. At this time, we're just in the process of closing the hatch on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Several of the closeout crew shook hands with the astronauts, and then proceeded to close the hatch on direction from the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin. We had it logged as the hatch being closed and tightened - still being tightened right at this time which is 25 minutes past the hour. Once the hatch is closed, we will start a cabin to condition the cabin inside. The three astronauts, of course, are on pure oxygen in their spacesuits on the suit circuit. We will produce a cabin atmosphere in the spacecraft of a 60/40 combination, 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. This is the atmosphere used for liftoff. Once that is accomplished, the closeout crew will be ready to put the boost protective cover on the hatch and continue with their closeout. The hatch being close at this time, we are proceeding. We'll standby to see how our hydrogen condition is as far as replenishing the hydrogen fuel supply with the 3rd stage to the Saturn V. 2 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-020059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control, we're at T-minus 2 hours, 55 seconds and counting. We're approaching the 2-hour mark in our countdown, and we appear to be proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The crew aboard the spacecraft, the 320-foot level - the hatch is closed and we're beginning to purge the cabin to bring it to the proper atmosphere for launch with is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen. 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen atmosphere. Of course, the astronauts themselves are breathing pure oxygen through their spacesuits. Coming up shortly will be another key test in which both the launch crew for both the launch vehicle crew and the spacecraft team combine together with the command, Neil Armstrong, to make a thorough check of the Emergency Detection System. This is the system that will signal the astronauts in the cabin if anything goes wrong below them. We use the ground-based computer to accomplish this test. As rather lengthy as these tests go using a computer, it will take some 30 minutes. Neil Armstrong will be doing most of the work in the spacecraft, responding as different cue lights signifying different difficulties are presented to him. The abort panel, of course, is across from the commander on the left-hand side, the left front, of the spacecraft. Our countdown continuing, T-minus 1 hour, 59 minutes, 34 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-015100|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 50 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. We're proceeding with the countdown of the Apollo 11 mission at this time, and it's going satisfactorily. At this point, the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong in the process of working the Emergency Detection System test. This is a test of the Emergency Detection System working with the launch crew here in the firing room, and also the spacecraft team and Control Rooms back at the Manned Spacecraft Operations building here at the Kennedy Space Center. All going well with these tests at the present time, we're flowing hydrogen back into the 3rd stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, after having difficulty with that leaking valve. It appears that we are bypassing the use of the valve directly in loading the hydrogen aboard, but we are getting hydrogen back in to replenish the supply. All appears to be going well at this time. Weather is GO. We're coming up on 1 hour and 50 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-014059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 1 hour, 40 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactory at this time, as we lead up to what our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, continuing this extensive series of checks of the Emergency Detection System, working with both the launch vehicle test crew, and the spacecraft crew. This is a key test, and a very thorough test to assure ourselves before we commit to liftoff, that all the emergency detection techniques inside the launch vehicle are operating properly here on the ground so if required in flight, the spacecraft commander and, of course, his two fellow astronauts, could be signaled of a difficulty inside the rocket and could take proper abort action as required. Thus far, the three astronauts aboard the spacecraft have just been giving business-like responses back to the directions and checks, working with the spacecraft conductor Skip Chauvin as he runs down his procedures as the countdown continues. We're at T-minus 1 hour, 39 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. This is Launch Control.|P
-013101|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All elements are GO with the countdown at this time, the countdown aimed at landing two astronauts on the Moon. At this time the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, going through some checks with astronaut Mike Collins aboard the spacecraft. We're winding up this important Emergency Detection System test that Neil Armstrong has been participating in. Meanwhile, at the 320-foot level the closeout crew now placing the boost protective cover over the hatch now that we have completed the cabin purge and have the proper environment inside the cabin. We have also performed leak checks to assure ourselves that the cabin atmosphere is valid. This boost protective cover is used during the early phases of the powered flight and it is jettisoned with the escape tower shortly after second stage ignition. Here in the firing room the launch vehicle test team's still keeping a close eye on the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We're back to 100 percent supply with the liquid hydrogen fuel in the third stage. This problem with the leaking valve is no problem at this time. We've actually bypassed the valve that we are maintaining our hydrogen supply aboard the vehicle. All aspects GO, the weather is very satisfactory for launch this morning, a thin cloud cover about 15,000 feet, temperature at launch time expected to be about 85 degrees. T-minus I hour, 29 minutes, 30 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-012100|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T-minus 1 hour, 20 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. All is still GO with the countdown for Apollo 11 at this time. At this point in the countdown Spacecraft Commander, Neil Armstrong, once again, appears to be the busiest worker in the spacecraft as he is performing a series of alignment checks associated with the guidance system in the spacecraft. He is working these checks with the Spacecraft Test Conductor as the test conductor reads out the various procedures and Armstrong responds to them. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft also were informed by the spacecraft conductor a short while ago that the launch vehicle is GO at this time. The hydrogen problem that we did encounter earlier has been solved. "That is real good news", said Armstrong and then he went back to work shortly thereafter. We are now coming up on the 1 hour, 20 minute mark in the countdown. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-011200|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T-minus 1 hour, 11 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. The countdown for Apollo 11 still going very satisfactorily at this time. In most cases, we're a matter of 5 or 10 minutes ahead of the countdown procedures. The crew in the white room at the 320-foot level who have been aiding the astronauts up to this time are just in the process of finishing up their work. They've been advised by the Spacecraft Test Conductor that they'll probably be able to move out in about 3 minutes or so. Once this is accomplished, once the close-out crew does depart, we'll be ready to move that swing-arm back - swing-arm 9. It will be moved 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch, this is about 5 feet away from the hatch. Once this is accomplished, we will arm the pyrotechnic systems in the spacecraft so in the event of a possible catastrophic condition below them, with the launch vehicle, while still on the pad, the astronauts could fire that escape rocket and separate from the rocket in difficulty. The crew - close-out crew are about to depart at this time. That swing-arm remains about 12 degrees away from the spacecraft hatch as mentioned - 5 feet or so until the 5-minute mark in the count when it's fully retracted to it's fall-back position. The obvious reason here is in the event we do have to get the astronauts out in a hurry, the swing-arm is in a stand-by position and could be moved rapidly back to the hatch - to the hatch level so the astronauts could depart in the event of an emergency. We're coming up on T-minus 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 20 seconds. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-010729|PAO|This is Apollo Launch Control at 1 hours 7 minutes 25 seconds and counting. Countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. For those people who would like to synchronize their watches in relation to the count, we'll synchronize on 26 minutes past the hour, which is now about 65 seconds away. We'll count down the last 5 seconds to 26 minutes past the hour. We're now 1 minute away from 26 minutes past the hour. In the meantime, we do have information from the Civil Defense Agency in the area. The estimate is more than a million persons are in the immediate area in Brevard County to watch the launch. Now 40 seconds away from 26 minutes past the hour. Civil Defense Agency reports further that there is extensive heavy traffic, a number of traffic jams, particularly in the area of Titusville and the U.S. 1 and Route 50. Countdown still progressing satisfactorily. 15 seconds away from 26 minutes.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 8:26am Eastern Daylight Time. We're now 1 hour 5 minutes 55 seconds and counting, as it was announced at that point. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-010100|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn launch control. T-minus 61 minutes and counting - T-minus 61 minutes on the Apollo 11 countdown, and all elements are GO at this time. Astronaut, Neil Armstrong has just completed a series of checks on that big service propulsion system engine that sits below him in the stack. We want to assure ourselves before liftoff that that engine can respond to commands from inside the spacecraft. As Neil Armstrong moved his rotational hand controller we assured ourselves that the engine did respond by swiveling or gimballing. This of course, is important for maneuvers in space. The countdown is still proceeding very satisfactorily other than two minor problems essentially picked up the count at 11pm Eastern Daylight Time last night, all has gone well. As we approach the one hour mark now, in the count a series of radio frequency and telemetry checks will be in progress with the launch vehicle. We'll also check out the tracking beacons in the instrument unit that travels as a guidance system for the Saturn V during the powered phase of flight. Now 59 minutes, 48 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy launch control.|P
-005559|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have just passed the 56-minute mark in our countdown. We are still proceeding in an excellent manner at this time. All elements reporting in that all systems continuing to look good at this point. We are still aiming toward our planned liftoff at the start of the lunar window 9:32am Eastern Daylight. A short while ago, in fact the Spacecraft Test Conductor - we are doing quite well, in fact some 15 minutes ahead on some aspects of the preparation spacecraft-wise. Armstrong replied that was fine, "just as long as we don't launch 15 minutes early." Obviously referring to the start of the window. The countdown still going well, T-minus 55 minutes, 10 seconds in counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-005059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We have passed the 51 minute mark in our countdown. We're now T-minus 50 minutes 51 seconds and counting. Apollo 11 countdown is still GO at this time, all elements reporting ready at this point in the countdown. The spacecraft - correction - the Test Supervisor, Bill Schick has advised all hands here in the Control Center and the spacecraft checkout people that in about 30 seconds that big swing arm that has been attached to the spacecraft up to now will be moved back to a parked position some 5 feet away from the spacecraft. We alert the astronauts because there is a little jolt when the swing arm is moved away. It will remain in that position, some 5 feet away from the spacecraft, until the 5 minute mark in the count when it's completely pulled away to its retracted position. It's coming up now in 5 seconds, the swing arm will come back. Mark. The swing arm now coming back from the spacecraft. Countdown proceeding satisfactorily, we've completed our telemetry checks with the launch vehicle and at this point with the swing arm back we arm the pyrotechnics so that escape tower atop the astronauts, atop their spacecraft, could be used if a catastrophic condition was going to occur under them with the launch vehicle from this point on down in the countdown. We have the high speed elevator located at the 320 foot level in the event the astronauts have to get out in a hurry. This is a special precaution. One of the members of the support team for Apollo 11, Astronaut Bill Pogue, is here in the firing room. He acts as Capsule Communicator during the countdown. His call sign is Stoney. He controls that elevator. He now has it locked at the 320-foot level. These are special precautions for safety purposes during the final phase of the count. Now coming up on the 49-minute in the countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-004600|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 46-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 45 minutes, 52 seconds and counting. All elements still GO the countdown at this time. The hard work on the spacecraft at this point in the countdown - Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat. He's been working with the Spacecraft Test Conductor on setting up proper switch settings in preparation for pressurizing their Reaction Control System. These are these big thrusters on the side of the Service Module. There's actually 16 of them in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. They are used for maneuvers in space. We pressurize that system before liftoff. That particular operation will be coming up in some 5 minutes or so. In preparation for it, Buzz Aldrin, who has most of the switches in front of him has been preparing for that particular event. The launch vehicle people keeping an eye on the status of the various propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. Just at liftoff, we will have a vehicle weighing close to 6-1/2 million pounds on the launch pad. There's more than a million gallons of propellants aboard the 3 stages of Saturn V. The reports here in the Control Center are the propellants are stable. They did look a little while ago at the RP-1, the high-grade kerosene fuel that's used in the first stage of the Saturn V to make sure it was at it's top level. We keep an eye on these various aspects throughout the count, and use the aid of computers to keep an overall look on general status. So now at T-minus 44 minutes, 21 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-004059|PAO|This is Apollo-Saturn launch control. We've passed the 41-minute mark in our count. T-minus 40 minutes, 53 seconds and counting. We are continuing, and we're continuing very excellently at this time. There are no problems that have been reported in as the countdown continues to click down. We're still aiming for the start of our window on this, the first flight to land Man on the Moon. Our - we're aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 9:32am Eastern Daylight Time. Coming up shortly will be a key test here in the firing room. As far as the launch vehicle people are concerned, it's a - some final checks of the destruct system aboard the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. In the event during powered flight that the vehicle strayed rather violently off course, the Range Safety Officer could take action to destroy the vehicle. This obviously would occur after the astronauts were separated by their escape tower from the faulty vehicle. We make a check of the destruct system to assure that if the signal is required to get through that, in fact, it will. This is what is coming up here in the Control Center at this time. All aspects of the mission still GO at T-minus 39 minutes, 47 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy launch control.|P
-003555|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 36-minute mark in our countdown. T-minus 35 minutes, 48 seconds and counting. We've completed those Range Safety command checks. All still going well with the countdown. A short while ago Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin, asked Neil Armstrong if the crew was comfortable up there and Neil reported back. He said it's - "we're very comfortable, it's very nice this morning". For a status report, we'll now switch to Mission Control, Houston.|P
-003523|PAO|This is Apollo Mission Control. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth's team is on station here in the Mission Operations Control Room, ready to assume the control of this flight at tower clearance. There is a possibility that Apollo 11 will check out the Command Module color TV camera during the first Earth revolution while in contact with the Goldstone station. If this checkout does occur, we acquire Goldstone at 1 hour, 29 minutes elapsed time. We have loss of signal at 1 hour, 33 minutes, 50 seconds elapsed time. This TV camera checkout is a possibility. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
-003059|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 31 minute mark in our count. At T-minus 30 minutes 52 seconds and counting, aiming toward our planned liftoff time of 32 minutes past the hour, the start of our launch window on this, the mission to land men on the Moon. The countdown still proceeding very satisfactorily at this time. We've got by an important test with the launch vehicle checking out the various batteries in the 3 stages and instrument unit of the Saturn V. We remain on external power through most of the count to preserve those batteries which must be used during the powered flight. We've just taken a look at them by going internal and then switching back to external again. The batteries all look good. The next time we go internal will be at the 50 second mark with those batteries and they will remain, of course, on internal power during the flight. The Lunar Module, which has been rather inactive during these latter phases of the count also is going on internal power at this time on the 2 batteries on the Ascent Stage and the 4 batteries on the Descent Stage. For the next 20 minutes we'll take a look at some systems in the Lunar Module, then power down at about the 10-minute mark in the count, power down the telemetry to preserve the power of the LM. The Lunar Module on Apollo 11, of course, when it separates from the Command Module in lunar orbit, will have the call sign Eagle. The Command Module call sign, once the 2 vehicles separate, will be Columbia. Both Columbia and Eagle are GO at this time at 29 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-002600|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We've just passed the 26 minute mark in the count, T-minus 25 minutes 53 seconds and counting, still proceeding very satisfactorily. At this time, Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin working with Astronaut, Buzz Aldrin in the middle seat covering the final pressurization of the Reaction Control System for the spacecraft. These are those big thrusters on the side of the Service Module that are used for maneuvers in space. Each one of these thrusters is capable of 100 pounds of thrust, there are 16 of them located in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. We pressurize the system with helium prior to launch to make sure that all will be in readiness for use in space. The countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. We picked up at the T-minus 9 hour mark at 11:00pm. Eastern Daylight Time last evening. We've just had 2 comparatively minor problems since that time. The major portion of the countdown during the early morning hours, some 5 hours of work was taken, to load the various propellants aboard the stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. As we came into the count this morning we did already have the fuel aboard the first stage, but it was necessary to bring the liquid oxygen aboard all 3 stages and the liquid hydrogen fuel aboard the second and third stages. Close to 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants were loaded during these 5 hours. Following that the astronauts, the prime crew, were awakened at 4:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight as planned in their countdown, and proceeded to have their physical examination in which they were declared flight ready. They sat down for the normal astronaut fare on launch day as far as breakfast is concerned, orange juice, steak, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. The 3 pilots were joined by 2 of their colleagues at breakfast, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and the backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders who has been named the Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The astronauts departed from their crew quarters - after checking out their suits, they departed from the crew quarters at 6:27am and some 27 minutes later, 8 miles away from the crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center a top the launch pad at complex 39, 6:54am. the commander, astronaut, Neil Armstrong, was the first aboard the spacecraft. He was followed about 5 minutes later by Mike Collins and finally Buzz Aldrin, the man who is sitting in the middle seat during liftoff, was the third astronaut to come aboard. Two minor problems have been encountered during the count - early in the count a malfunction light came on here in the Control Center indicating that we might have a communication problem at the launch pad. Nothing to do with the spacecraft, but it indicated we possibly might not be able to talk to some key technicians we had at the pad. The problem turned out to be very minor, a simple adjustment of some equipment beneath the pad remedied the problem. There was no, in fact, no equipment problem involved. The second problem, we did encounter a leaky valve in part of the equipment that is used to replenish the hydrogen fuel supply on the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. A team of technicians were sent out to the launch pad, at about the time the astronauts were traveling to the pad. They tightened some bolts and we were able to bypass this valve and to proceed with our countdown. The weather is certainly GO. It's a beautiful morning for a launch to the Moon. We expect a temperature of about 85 degrees in the Kennedy Space Center area. The winds about 10 miles - 10 knots, rather from the southeast, and the weather conditions in the round-the-world track, according to reports to the Manned Space Flight Meteorology Group indicate all weather conditions are acceptable for launch. That's our general status. We've Just passed the 22 minute mark in the count. 21 minutes 55 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-001600|PAO|This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control. We are now less than 16 minutes away from the planned liftoff for the Apollo 11 space vehicle. All still going well with the countdown at this time. The astronauts aboard the spacecraft have had a little chance to rest over the last few minutes or so. At least they haven't been busy with procedures with the Spacecraft Test Conductor. In the meantime we have been performing final checks on the tracking beacons and the instrument unit which is used as a guidance system during the powered phase of flight. Once we get down to the 3-minute and 10-second mark in the countdown, we'll go on an automatic sequence. As far as the launch vehicle is concerned all aspects from there on down will be automatic, run by the ground master computer here in the firing room. This will lead up to the 8.9-minute mark in the countdown when the ignition sequence will begin in those five engines of the first stage, the S-IC stage of Saturn V. At the 2-second mark we'll get information and a signal that all engines are running and at the zero mark in the countdown once we get the commit signal, the signal that says that the thrust is proper and acceptable, we then will get a commit and liftoff as the hold-down arms release the vehicle. We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upwards, a vehicle that weighs close to 6-1/2 million pounds. We are now 14 minutes and 30 seconds and counting and this is Kennedy Launch Control.|P
-001100|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We've passed the 11-minute mark. Now T-minus 10 minutes 54 seconds on our countdown for Apollo 11. All still GO at this time. The astronauts in the spacecraft busy again. The Commander, Neil Armstrong, has performed some final switch settings for the Stabilization and Control System of the spacecraft. The spacecraft also now is on full internal power. This came shortly after the 15-minute mark. Spacecraft now on the full power of it's fuel cells. Up to this time, it had been sharing the load with an external power source. Both Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have armed their rotational hand controllers - the controllers they use in flight and we have now gone to automatic system with the Emergency Detection System. That system - it would cue the astronauts if there's trouble down below with the Saturn V rocket during the powered flight. We're now coming up on the 10-minute mark. 10 minutes away from our planned liftoff. MARK. T-minus 10 minutes and counting, T-minus 10.

Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin now has completed the status check of his personnel in the Control Room. All report they are GO for the mission, and this has been reported to the Test Supervisor, Bill Schick. The Test Supervisor now going through some status checks. Launch Operations Manager, Paul Donnelly, reports GO for launch. Launch Director, Rocco Petrone, now gives a GO. We're 5 minutes, 20 seconds and counting. Coming up shortly that swing arm up at the spacecraft level will come back to its fully retraced position. It should occur at the 5-minute mark in the count. In the meantime the Lunar Module telemetry has been powered down. We took a good look at Eagle, and it looks good. The Spacecraft Test Conductor for the Lunar Module reported that Eagle was GO. The swing arm now coming back to its fully retracted position as our countdown continues. T-4 minutes, 50 seconds and counting. Skip Chauvin informing the astronauts that the swing arm now coming back. The astronauts will have a few more reports coming up in the countdown. The last business report will be from Neil Armstrong at the 45 seconds mark in the count when he gives the status on the final alignment of the Stabilization and Control System.

0011044|LMP|Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5 millimeters to 75; I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoomed - -|O
0011058|CDR|I would think so.|O
0011059|LMP|- - and 12.5 is wide angle.|O
0011101|CDR|Yes.|O
0011102|LMP|The only thing that confuses me is that it says for vehicle to vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view, probably. That's why they said that, rather than telephoto.|O
0011115|CMP|Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.|O
0011118|LMP|Okay. You didn't touch this lighting?|O
0011121|CMP|No, I didn't ... Minimum ...|O

0011227|LMP|Okay, this looks alright, I think.|O
0011229|CMP|Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yes, we'll get it. If you can't see it worth a shit, what's the difference? You want to see the monitor?|O
0011240|LMP|...|O
0011242|CMP|Yes. You want to see the monitor? ...|O
0011248|CDR|Is this all ready to go; I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz.|O
0011301|LMP|Yes. ...|O
0011305|CDR|Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.|O
0011313|LMP|Okay.|O
0011314|CDR|There are two pieces on the back of them ...|O
0011317|LMP|You think so, huh?|O

0011328|LMP|Now, ... better off ... It's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down.|O
0011353|CDR|I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.|O
0011358|LMP|Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to - know which way to move it.|O
0011406|CDR|Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.|O
0011424|LMP|Hey, there's something. How's that window? ...|O

0011513|CMP|What - what - do you want a tissue for?|O
0011515|CDR|Hey, that's a good idea. We can get rid of that stuff - -|O
0011517|LMP|You're damned right.|O
0011520|CDR|- - that's a good idea; good head.|O
0011523|LMP|Brilliant ...|O
0011524|CDR|I got your checklist, Mike; you want it back?|O
0011527|CMP|Yes, I'll take it back, Neil - Thank you, just put it here.|O
0011538|CMP|No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me BUZZ'S.|O
0011542|CDR|Excuse me.|O
0011544|CMP|... I'd rather have my own.|O
0011549|LMP|How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?|O
0011552|CDR|Yes, it looks fine to me.|O
0011554|LMP|Good.|O
0011557|CMP|I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on ...|O
0011607|LMP|...|O
0011609|CMP|Yes, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?|O
0011614|LMP|No, one-handed snap. ... I'm in the center now. ...|O
0011629|CMP|Okay, Buzz, the - -|O
0011631|LMP|Alright, I'll put yours on the left.|O
0011633|CMP|It doesn't matter, I'll - screw it - far as I'm concerned, one's like another.|O
0011637|LMP|As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.|O
0011639|CMP|Okay.|O
0011640|LMP|...|O
0011643|CMP|This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can – on this bracket.|O
0011653|LMP|Yes.|O
0011653|CDR|Okay, that was correct. You - you were asking about that.|O
0011658|CMP|And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color; you got 15 minutes worth - 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th.|O
0011718|LMP|Okay. The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that?|O
0011728|LMP|Outside of it ...|O
0011732|CMP|On the magazine?|O
0011737|LMP|Yes.|O
0011742|CMP|How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?|O
0011746|CDR|No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.|O
0011748|LMP|... I don't know - even feel that.|O
0011751|CDR|I feel the horizon coming up.|O
0011753|CMP|Oh, yes.|O
0011756|CDR|Buzz, are you ready to - -|O
0011757|CMP|... 90 degrees the wrong way - -|O
0011759|CDR|- - are you ready for this briefing? Buzz?|O
0011801|LMP|Yes, let me get this.|O
0011802|CDR|Oh, Okay.|O
0011805|CMP|Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.|O
0011810|CDR|Say, we got the rookie with us; he hasn't seen so many of those.|O
0011814|CDR|(Laughter) Okay. 30 seconds.|O
0011831|CMP|Oh, no, there is a possibility.|O
0011833|CDR|We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?|O
0011843|LMP|Okay, go ahead and talk.|O
0011844|CMP|Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It works like a camera. It has the – The f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom - Your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and you're 12.5 millimeters on the middle one – See, 12.5 millimeters?|O
0011918|LMP|Yes.|O
0011919|CMP|That's the zoom. Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.|O
0011947|LMP|I think that - that's going to do it.|O
0011956|CDR|Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.|O
0011958|CMP|Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!|O
0012000|CDR|Isn't that something?|O
0012001|CMP|God damn, that's pretty; it's unreal.|O
0012007|CDR|I forgot to get a picture of that.|O
0012011|CMP|Ooh, sure, I will. Oh, I've lost the Hasselblad. ... Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far - big son of a gun like that.|O
0012041|CDR|Now, what do we have - Is that all the -|O
0012044|CMP|You had the switch on inside. Oh ya, okay ... the checklist. This automatic light control features.|O
0012100|CMP|Well, that pisses me off. Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the ... Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?|O
0012119|LMP|Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it ...?|O
0012123|CMP|Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.|O
0012146|CMP|I am much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.|O
0012202|CDR|And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time until the ...|O
0012214|CMP|I've looked - I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.|O
0012222|LMP|You can go to your ...|O
0012225|CDR|It's too late for sunrise, anyway.|O
0012228|CMP|I know, but I'm worried about - -|O
0012229|LMP|But you want to get it before TLI.|O
0012231|CMP|- - I know it. That's what I'm worried about.|O
0012232|LMP|Neil, could you look around over there?|O
0012234|CDR|Yes, I'll look.|O
0012236|CMP|I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it. Do we have to throw some other switches?|O
0012242|LMP|No, the switches are all thrown.|O
0012245|CMP|... under you.|O
0012258|CMP|Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?|O
0012310|CMP|Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody ...?|O
0012317|LMP|I've looked already.|O
0012325|CMP|Ah! Here it is.|O
0012327|CDR|Find it?|O
0012327|CMP|Yes.|O
0012328|CDR|Beautiful.|O
0012329|CMP|It was floating in the aft bulkhead.|O
0012331|CDR|On your side?|O
0012335|CMP|I got a way on it - of keeping it. ...|O
0012417|CMP|I got a little horizon. Man, look at that!|O
0012422|LMP|Looks like what you have to do to this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up - -|O
0012427|CDR|How's the monitor, working okay for you? Anything I can do to help?|O
0012436|CMP|...|O

0012452|CMP|Trees and a forest down there; it looks like trees and a forest or something. Looks like snow and trees. Fantastic. I have no conception of where we're pointed or which way we're going or a crapping thing, but it's a beautiful low pressure cell out here.|O
0012511|LMP|Yes, go ahead and take a picture. Keep your ... down.|O
0012516|CMP|Beautiful low pressure.|O
0012516|LMP|Must be past Hawaii by now. 01:28 is AOS.|O
0012523|CDR|Buzz, how's it going there, the monitor giving you good service?|O
0012526|LMP|Not yet - flicking an awful lot.|O
0012528|CDR|Well, that's ... - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off 22, maybe not – focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.|O
0012545|LMP|Sun is bright, isn't it? ... It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth. ...|O
0012601|CDR|I think you probably want sort of a wide angle - -|O
0012606|LMP|Yes, I think ... would be something ...|O

0012751|CMP|Oh, shoot; they're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI pad, TLI abort, and a P37 pad. They're all right here in this little book; don't forget to remind me of that.|O
0012803|CMP|Okay, that's good.|O

0033806|CMP|I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACCEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S-IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.|T

We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabasca - probably east of Athabasca area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.|T

Designed to put the third stage of the launch vehicle into a trajectory that will take it behind the trailing edge of the Moon and then into a solar orbit. The crew did not witness this maneuver. The Command Module was not in the proper attitude where they could see the S-IVB at the time. We've advised the crew that we do not believe that we'll do the first mid-course correction. That we'll wait for mid-course correction 2 tomorrow and expect a DELTA V to be performed in that maneuver of about 21.3 feet per second. We've also had some other brief transmissions including a - comments from Neil Armstrong on the view out the window, and a weather report on the part of the world he can see.

0063656|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to reject the NOUN 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again. Over.|T
0063703|CMP|Okay. Will do.|T
0063847|CMP|Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?|T
0063853|CC|Roger. We see it. Stand by.|T
0064023|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.|T
0064034|CMP|Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?|T
0064046|CC|Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.|T
0064109|CMP|Okay. We'll do it, then.|T
0064114|CC|And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.|T
0064121|CMP|Roger. Thank you.|T
0064256|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. If you like this, we'll accept it as well.|T
0064259|CC|Stand by.|T
0064346|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Over.|T
0064351|CMP|Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll do that now.|T
0064353|CC|Thank you.|T
0064440|CMP|And we're going to proceed on this one, too, Charlie.|T
0064442|CC|Roger. Copy.|T
0064835|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Another NOUN 49 for you.|T
0064840|CC|Roger. We copy. Stand by.|T
0064900|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to recycle and do this one over again. Over.|T
0064907|CMP|Okay.|T
0065213|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 52 minutes. Apollo 11 now 31,565 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 10,789 feet per second. The crew at this time is involved in mid-course navigation using their onboard optical system. We have completed the changeover in briefing of shifts here in Mission Control, and the crew activities, until the sleep period begins, will consist of housekeeping, functions aboard the spacecraft, changing out carbon dioxide filters. They will not be doing the mid-course correction scheduled for 11:45 into the flight as the first opportunity. The change-of-shift briefing is scheduled to begin shortly. Any conversations that develop with the crew during that period of time will be tape recorded, and we'll play those back following the change-of-shift briefing. This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 53 minutes.|P
0065341|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0065343|CC|Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.|T
0065345|LMP|Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.|T
0065350|CC|Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.|T
0065549|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12:25 in the Flight Plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.|T
0065605|LMP|Roger. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.|T
0065610|CC|Affirm.|T
0065616|CMP|And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the sub-stellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the sub-stellar point on this star? It's our second star.|T
0065631|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0065721|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the Flight Plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the Flight Plan. Over.|T
0065736|CMP|Okay. We'll try that.|T
0065828|CMP|Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.|T
0065832|CC|Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the Flight Plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 130.7. Over.|T
0065847|CMP|Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 340.00.|T
0065855|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0070332|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the sub-stellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.|T
0070345|CC|Roger. We copy it all.|T
0070924|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've run the angles given in the Flight Plan for the P23 attitude through the machines down here, and they come up the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the non-symmetrical horizon might by giving a problem. Over.|T
0070951|CMP|Yes, I'd say - It could be, Charlie. Stand by here. We'll get another mark for you.|T
0070954|CC|Okay.|T
0071030|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. NOUN 49 for you.|T
0071034|CC|Roger. Copy.|T
0071040|CC|Stand by.|T
0071105|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. Over.|T
0071115|CMP|Okay.|T
0072056|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?|T
0072100|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 7 hours, 21 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. During the change-of-shift briefing, we accumulated about 4 minutes of tape conversation with the spacecraft. That conversation generally related to the onboard batteries, which are currently being charged - a routine operation - and also the mid-course navigation exercise that the crew is currently involved in. We'll play back the tape for you now, and then stand by for any live conversation with the crew.|P
0072104|CC|Stand by.|T
0072121|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.|T
0072126|CMP|Yes. Roger. All right. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?|T
0072130|CC|Stand by, Mike.|T
0072131|CMP|Okay.|T
0072146|CC|11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.|T
0072148|CMP|Okay.|T
0073259|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0073302|CC|Go ahead. Over.|T
0073304|CMP|Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.|T
0073317|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.|T
0073320|CMP|Yes. I'd appreciate that.|T
0073349|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.|T
0073353|CMP|Okay.|T
0073354|CC|And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.|T
0073409|CMP|Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the sub-stellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.|T
0073421|CC|Roger.|T
0073449|CMP|And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?|T
0073458|CC|I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.|T
0073501|CMP|Okay.|T
0073502|CC|That is negative. Stand by one.|T
0073506|CMP|Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.|T
0073516|CC|Stand by.|T
0073532|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. LMP is back on the line.|T
0073536|CC|Roger. Copy.|T
0073540|LMP|Read you five-by.|T
0073542|CC|Rog. You're same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 197.8 for roll, 128.5 pitch, 340.0 yaw.|T
0073558|CMP|Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 313.65. Over.|T
0073615|CC|Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.|T
0073631|CMP|Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.|T
0073638|CC|Roger.|T
0074324|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0074327|CC|Go ahead. Over.|T
0074329|CMP|Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.|T
0074345|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0074348|CMP|I think something's wrong with those attitudes.|T
0074515|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.|T
0074522|CMP|That's affirmative.|T
0074526|CC|Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.|T
0074535|CMP|Okay. Stand by.|T
0074630|CC|11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.|T
0074645|CMP|Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.|T
0074755|CMP|Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.|T
0074803|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0074811|CMP|It still looks like I'm far from the sub-stellar point. However, I'm off quite a bit in roll.|T
0074818|CC|Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.|T
0074828|CMP|Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a bit in order to get it parallel to the horizon.|T
0074841|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.|T
0074851|CMP|Well, then we're not at the sub-stellar point if we're not.|T
0074854|CC|Roger.|T
0075139|CMP|Houston, you copy that NOUN 49?|T
0075141|CC|Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.|T
0075209|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter. Over.|T
0075216|CMP|Okay.|T
0075255|CMP|Do you need me to wait in the NOUN 49 display for any length of time?|T
0075301|CC|Negative.|T
0075303|CMP|Okay.|T
0075429|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.|T
0075433|CC|Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.|T
0075443|CMP|Okay.|T
0075520|CMP|They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie. Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?|T
0075523|CC|Stand by, Mike.|T
0075527|CMP|It's no trouble.|T
0075530|CC|Roger. Stand by. Out.|T
0075607|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do two more on star 45. Over.|T
0075614|CMP|Okay.|T
0075802|CMP|Okay, Charlie. There's your two more marks. Where do you want to go from here?|T
0075805|CC|Stand by.|T
0075821|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 195.2, pitch 123.9, yaw 340.0. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.|T
0075845|CMP|Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, pitch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.|T
0075857|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0075900|CMP|Okay.|T
0080207|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, I'm misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.|T
0080220|CC|Stand by.|T
0080240|CMP|See, if my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the sub-stellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.| T
0080250|CC|Stand by one. Over.|T
0080252|CMP|Okay.|T
0080324|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike. The horizon looks cocked off to you - You look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent LM reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a - You should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is. Over.|T
0080354|CMP|Okay.|T
0080408|CMP|I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.|T
0080414|CC|Copy.|T
0080508|CMP|VERB or - NOUN 49 for you, Charlie.|T
0080513|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0080545|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to accept this one and give us two more and that will be enough. Over.|T
0080552|CMP|Okay.|T
0080818|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 8 minutes. Apollo 11 now 38,812 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 9,682 feet per second. And we've just put in a call to the crew; we'll stand by for - -|P
0080825|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see your termination on P23. Thank you very much. Mike, we'll have a - We're trying to work up a story here for you; we'll be with you momentarily on an explanation of what's happening. Over.|T
0080838|CMP|Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the sub-stellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.|T
0080856|CC|Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.|T
0080903|CMP|Thank you, sir.|T
0081100|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have a PTC REFSMMAT for you momentarily. Over.|T
0081113|CDR|Roger. Going P00 and ACCEPT.|T
0081125|PAO|The PTC REFSMMAT, which Capcom, Charlie Duke, just referred to is the Passive Thermal Control attitude that the crew will place the spacecraft in. In this attitude the spacecraft will be rotated at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature balance.|P

0081401|CDR|You're BLOCK. Thank you.|T
0082444|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to do a P52, option 1 preferred, and establish PTC as listed in the Flight Plan at 12 hours. We'd like you to commence that right now, Mike. And we have some stars recommended for you. For stars 26, 30, and 24, when you get to attitude 000. Over.|T
0082519|CDR|Okay, Charlie. He's off the wick right now. Understand you're ready for us to do a P52, option 1?|T
0082531|CC|11, it's a P52, option 1 preferred. Over.|T
0082536|CDR|Roger. And, let's see, that is Spica, Menkent, and what else?|T
0082543|CC|Roger. Stars - Codes are stars 26, 30, and 24. Over.|T
0082549|CDR|24. Okay.|T
0083543|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We notice your PROGRAM ALARM, Mike, was due to using these stars in the P23 attitude. If you'll go to 000, the stars we gave you will work. Over.|T
0083602|CMP|Okay. Understand.|T
0084119|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Prior to you starting your P52, we'd like to give you a new CSM state vector. Over.|T

0085925|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 59 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft altitude is currently reading 42,753 nautical miles, and we show a velocity of about 9,100 feet per second. We are in the process now of up linking to the space craft attitude for the Passive Thermal Control mode. Under this mode the spacecraft will be rotated about its X axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperature balance within the spacecraft. The crew has completed the mid-course navigation exercise. They will shortly be aligning the spacecraft stable platform, used as a attitude reference in the guidance system. This is a routine procedure, and following that, the spacecraft will be placed in the Passive Thermal Control mode where normally it would be left during the sleep period. The cabin temperature in the Command Module, has been running between 65 and 70 degrees. The current spacecraft weight is 96,460 pounds.|P
0090059|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can do the VERB 66. The computer is yours, and then the P52, option 1 preferred. Over.|T
0090107|CMP|Roger.|T
0091254|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 13 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Based on biomedical data, a Flight Surgeon reports that it appears the crew removed their pressure garments - their pressure suits at about 8:00pm for the Commander, Neil Armstrong and Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin apparently got out of his pressure suit about 1 hour earlier or about 7 hours Ground Elapsed Time. The spacecraft is currently 44,529 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity has dropped now to 8,983 feet per second. We do have, rather poor lock with the spacecraft antenna at this time accounting for the noise on the air to ground circuit. We'll take down the circuit until we've reestablished better lock, and we'll record any conversations that occur in the interim. At 9 hours, 14 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.|P
0091610|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.|T
0091811|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our COMM. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred ...|T
0091825|CMP|... not a very good attitude at all for COMM, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.|T
0091834|CC|Roger, 11. We copy. Recommend you go to this P52, option 1 preferred, and then go to PTC attitude. Over. Then we'll get some COMM. When you get there to PTC attitude, it'll be pitch 90, yaw 0 on the high-gain. Over.|T

0093617|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 36 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission continuing to go smoothly at this point. The communications noise that we were experiencing previously cleared up after the crew was able to get the spacecraft in a good attitude for antenna log-on and we had one brief conversation which we taped and we're presently communicating with the crew at this time. We'll pick up the tape and then continue to follow live conversation.|P
0093621|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0093639|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can torque the NOUN 93. Over.|T
0093644|CMP|Okay.|T
0093848|PAO|That brings us up to date with the taped conversation that we had. We'll continue to stand by for any live communications with the spacecraft. Most of that conversation with Mike Collins involved the platform alignment which the crew is involved in at the present time, aligning the stable platform used by the Guidance System as an attitude reference. Apollo 11 is presently 46,688 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is 8,750 feet per second.|P
0094034|CMP|Okay, Houston. That completes the P52. We verified the third star with Antares, and AUTO optics are pointing at it pretty closely. How do our platform drift angles look so far, Charlie?|T
0094046|CC|Stand by.|T
0094056|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We didn't have a chance to get a good check for you. We're going to run a drift check from this alignment until the next one, approximately 12 hours, and we'll have something for you later. Over.|T

0100700|CC|How's Baja California look, Buzz?|T
0100708|LMP|Well, it's got some clouds up and down it, and there's a pretty good circulation system a couple of hundred miles off the west coast of California.|T
0100721|CC|Roger. 11, we'd like you to close the waste storage vent valve right now.|T
0100729|CMP|Okay.|T
0100749|CMP|Waste storage vent valves closed.|T
0100751|CC|Copy.|T
0100852|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like - The rates are looking pretty good right now on the PTC, but we'd like you to continue holding. Over.|T
0100900|CMP|Okay. Fine.|T
0102028|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your rates look really great, now. You can start your PTC.|T
0102034|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Charlie.|T
0102150|CDR|Houston, you read 11?|T
0102152|CC|Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.|T
0102156|CDR|Roger. If you'd like to delay PTC just for 10 minutes or so, we can shoot you some TV of a seven-eights Earth. That's - We'll leave that up to you.|T
0102212|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0102250|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll have our answer for you on the TV in about 1 minute. Over.|T
0102552|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.|P
0102556|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready at Goldstone for the TV. It'll be recorded at Goldstone and then replayed back over here, Neil, any time you want to turn her on, we're ready. Over.|T
0102610|CDR|Okay. It'll take us about 5 minutes to get rigged.|T
0102613|CC|Roger.|T
0102620|PAO|Capcom, Charlie Duke, advised the crew that we would be recording the television at Goldstone. We don't have an estimate at this time as to how long it will take to get a playback of that from Goldstone.|P
0102631|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you verify the reading on your O2 flow indicator? Over.|T
0102645|CDR|We're showing 0.2. We just inadvertently touched the RAPID REPRESS button. That made a temporary glitch in the flow.|T
0102656|CC|Roger. During that glitch there, did it go almost a peg high? Over.|T
0102705|CDR|I'd believe that.|T
0102714|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you tell us - tell us if the O2 flow indicator was pegged to HIGH prior to closing the waste storage vent valve? Over.|T
0102726|LMP|No, it was not.|T
0102728|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T
0103100|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. A while ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the AUTO drive on the high-gain. We'd like you to position the antenna at pitch 30, yaw 270, go to REACQ and that will give us narrow beam-width. Over.|T
0103127|CDR|That yaw 270 and pitch 3 - What was the pitch?|T
0103132|CC|Pitch 30, Neil.|T
0103135|CDR|Okay. I think we've got you.|T
0103145|CC|Roger. We've got a good signal there. Thank you much.|T
0103220|CDR|... Okay, Houston. We are sending a picture of Earth down right now, so you can let us know if they're receiving at Goldstone.|T
0103236|CC|Roger, 11. Goldstone is receiving the TV. Stand by. We'll let you know on the quality. Over.|T
0103335|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says that the TV looks great. Over.|T
0103345|CDR|Okay, roger. We're zooming in on the Earth now.|T
0103353|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Did you copy? Over.|T
0103357|LMP|... Roger. We copied, Charlie.|T
0103404|CC|Roger. Your transmissions the last couple of times have been about two-by. Over.|T
0103410|LMP|Okay. How do you read me now?|T
0103411|CC|Roger. You're five-by now.|T
0103413|LMP|Okay. We're zooming the lens on in until it will just about fill the monitor.|T
0103420|CC|Roger.|T
0103435|CDR|Okay. It's in full zoom, now.|T
0103441|CC|Copy, 11.|T
0103445|CDR|And how about the f-stop? Is 22 going to be adequate?|T
0103449|CC|Stand by. We'll get with the Goldstone TV guy. We don't have anything here at Houston. Stand by.|T
0103501|CMP|It looks good on the monitor, as far as the f-stop goes. Therefore, we just assumed it's okay at Goldstone.|T
0103527|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says it - TV looks really great, five-by; we don't - The AGC looks like it's working fine. The f/22 is good; we have no real white spots. They're real pleased with it. Over.|T
0103542|CDR|Okay. You just cut out, Charlie. We understand that it's looking great. We'll leave it the way it is and wait for you to come back on.|T
0103551|CC|Roger. How do you read me now? Over.|T
0103554|CDR|Five-by.|T
0103555|CC|Okay. My comments were - My comments were from Goldstone that they see no white spots as we saw in 10. Looks like the AGC's working real well. The f/22 looks good. Over.|T
0103608|CDR|Okay. Very good. Well, we shut out the Sun coming in from the other windows into the spacecraft, so it's looking through a - the number 1 window, and there isn't any reflected light ... now. So, it ought to be a pretty good picture.|T
0103624|CC|Roger.|T
0103705|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to keep the TV on for about 10 minutes or so, so we can get come good comparison on the camera. You can do anything your heart desires on the TV: interior, exterior, pan in and out, anything you'd like. Over.|T
0103746|CC|11, Houston. Over.|T
0103804|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.|T
0103806|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.|T
0103808|CMP|Charlie, I'm sorry; you keep cutting out. We heard up to "you can do anything," and then after that we didn't hear anything, and we knew that wasn't right anyhow because we can't. But what do you want us to do?|T
0103822|CC|Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back in to us. What we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. On the exterior shots, we'd like to look - -|T
0103847|CMP|You cut out again.|T
0103848|CC|Stand by.|T
0103852|CMP|Start over with, "we were saying."|T
0103937|LMP|Hey, Houston. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we can get a little bit more than just water?|T
0103945|CC|Roger, 11. I don't think we got much control over that. Looks like you'll have to settle for the water.|T
0104002|CC|11, Houston. We're going to change - thinking about changing our voice uplink to another site. If you'll stand by, we'll see if we can improve the quality. Over.|T
0104011|CDR|Okay, Charlie.|T
0104012|LMP|We'll stand by for your call.|T
0104049|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll try once more on this TV request. We'd like 10 minutes worth of TV. And we'd like a narrative, if you could give us one, on the exterior shots. You could also - we also suggest you might try the - an interior position. Over.|T
0104110|CDR|Roger. We're seeing the center of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America. The United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia. I'm not sure you'll be able to see all that on your screen down there ...|T
0104205|CC|Roger, Neil. We just wanted a narrative such that we can - When we get the playback, we can sort of correlate what we're seeing. Thank you very much.|T
0104220|CMP|I haven't seen anything but the DSKY so far.|T
0104225|CC|Looks like they're hogging the windows.|T
0104229|LMP|You're right.|T
0104659|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. On your CRYO's, we'd like at this time for you to place all four CRYO heaters to AUTO and turn off all four CRYO fans. Over.|T
0104715|LMP|Okay. All four CRYO heaters are AUTO. And all four CRYO fans are off. ...|T
0104726|CC|Roger. That's going to be your sleep configuration.|T
0104729|LMP|Okay.|T
0104730|CC|And, Buzz, we'll be terminating the battery charge in about a half hour.|T
0104735|LMP|Roger.|T
0104759|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the TV at your convenience. We've got enough tape. And you can start PTC at your convenience. The rates look super for starting up. Over.|T
0104814|CDR|Roger, Charlie.|T
0105035|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours, 51 minutes. That TV transmission lasted about 15 minutes. Goldstone reported that we did get good quality on it. We estimate that it will be somewhere between an hour and a half or two hours before we have the television available here in Houston to play back. The lines will have to be called up between Goldstone and Mission Control Center, and the conversion equipment brought up online before we'll be able to play back the television from that transmission. At the beginning of the TV transmission, the spacecraft was approximately 50,980 nautical miles from Earth, and at the conclusion they were about 52,248 nautical miles from Earth.|P
0105732|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have a Flight Plan update for you and some P37 block data, if you're ready to copy. Over.|T
0105742|CMP|Stand by.|T
0105819|CMP|Okay, Houston. PTC is started now; looks good to us, and we'll be ready to copy in a minute or two.|T
0105825|CC|Roger. Copy, 11.|T
0105859|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy the Flight Plan update and P37.|T
0105905|CC|Roger. Stand by one, Buzz.|T
0105922|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Coming at you with the P37 block data. Over.|T
0105929|LMP|Okay.|T

0110155|CC|Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a Flight Plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and that you can do them at your convenience and then go to sleep early, if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O2 fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM DELTA-P, and accomplish the pre-sleep checklist.|T
0110234|LMP|Okay. We've completed the filter change, and we'll get started on the fuel cell purge, and stand by for the LM/CM DELTA-P.|T
0110242|CC|Roger, 11. Would you hold off on the fuel cell purge? EECOMM is saying we might not have to do that. Over.|T
0110251|CDR|Okay.|T
0110305|CMP|Charlie, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.5.|T
0110309|CC|Copy. 0.5. Out.|T
0110356|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've just decided to delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.|T
0110402|CDR|Roger. Delete the O2 fuel cell purge.|T
0110621|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.|T
0110719|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.|T
0110722|CC|Roger.|T
0110728|CMP|Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?|T
0110742|CC|That's negative. That question's answered. Thank you much.|T
0110746|CMP|Okay.|T
0110900|PAO|This is Apollo Control. During that last transmission you heard Capcom, Charlie Duke advise the crew that we are not seeing as high an O2, or oxygen flow, as we would have expected at this point. This would indicate that the enrichment of the cabin atmosphere, which was 60 percent oxygen, 40 percent nitrogen at launch and which is normally enriched with pure oxygen during the course of the/flight, is not enriching as rapidly as we would expect. This could be a transducer problem - one of the devices that measures the O2 flow rate - or possibly a partial obstruction of one of the vents. The problem is not thought to be significant at this point, and we'll be monitoring the O2 flow during the night.|P
0110953|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have an S-band configuration for you. Over.|T
0110959|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
0111001|CC|Roger, Buzz. We'd like you to place the S-band antenna OMNI A switch to the Bravo position. S-band antenna OMNI switch to the OMNI position, the high-gain track to MANUAL, and the high-gain angles will be yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.|T
0111026|LMP|Roger. Understand. OMNI to Baker and OMNI, MANUAL. And the angles are yaw 270, pitch minus 50, and was that narrow or wide? Over.|T
0111047|CC|Stand by. Roger. We'd like it in WIDE, and you can set that configuration up now. Over.|T
0111056|LMP|It's in work.|T
0111304|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate battery Bravo charge, and we'd like a crew status report. We're about to tell you good night. Over.|T
0111314|CDR|Roger. Stand by.|T
0111808|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. The battery charging is complete, and the crew status report is as follows: radiation, CDR 11002, CMP 10002, LMP 09003; negative medication; fit as a fiddle. Over.|T
0111833|CC|Roger. Copy, 11. Thank you much. We'd like to ask one question. Have you tried the gas separator on the water, and how is that working? Over.|T
0111846|CDR|Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments on that.|T
0111850|CMP|It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tube-full we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.|T
0111931|CC|Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on DOWNVOICE BACKUP. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some Z's. Over.|T
0111953|CMP|Okay. Maybe we'll get around to lunch.|T
0111956|CC|How about a peanut butter and jelly?|T
0112910|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 29 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We don't expect to hear a great deal more from the crew tonight. At about 11 hours, 20 minutes we said good-night to them from Mission Control and they're beginning their sleep period about 2 hours early. The additional time available for sleep was made available by deleting the mid-course correction. The first opportunity which occurred at 11 hours, 45 minutes. That mid-course correction has been moved to mid-course correction 2 to the opportunity of mid-course correction 2 of which would occur tomorrow. The last conversation we had with the crew, we received a status report and a report that they had taken no medication and were "fit as a fiddle". We also got a report from Mike Collins on the gas separation unit which is being flown on this flight. This consists of 2 stainless steel cylinders about 5 inches long and about an inch to an inch and half in diameter. The cylinders are attached to the water gun or to the water spigot on the food preparation panel and remove the gas from the water as it flows through the filter. The filter actually has two filters inside. One which attracts water and one which repels it, in the process removing the gas. Mike Collins reported that the filters seem to be working quite well. That the water was coming out almost free of bubbles. He did report that they had a minor problem with a leak at the junction between the food bag and the filter. Mission Control advised that we would give that some thought and try to come up with some solution to it when they wake up tomorrow. At this time, Apollo 11 is 55,522 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 7,920 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 32 minutes.|P
0114708|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 47 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. At this time we are receiving the television data from Goldstone. The data is coming in. It will be processed here and converted, and we estimate that it will be available for playback in about 20 to 30 minutes and we will have a firm time on that as soon as possible. At the present time Apollo 11 is 56,704 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity is 7,821 feet per second. We have had no further conversations with the crew since we passed along a good night to them at 11 hours 20 minutes. Getting them to bed about 2 hours ahead of the scheduled time on the Flight Plan, as a result of the deletion of mid-course correction 1. At 11 hours 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0120501|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 5 minutes. We expect to have the unscheduled television transmission, which came in to Goldstone California and  was taped there and has been transmitted to Mission Control Center ready and converted for replay in color at 8:45pm Central Daylight Time. That would be about 7 minutes from now. The TV transmission runs for a total time of about 16 and a half minutes and there's an exterior shot out the window of the Earth. At the time of the transmission Apollo 11 was some 50 thousand 9 hundred 80 nautical miles from Earth. The transmission came into Goldstone at the Ground Elapsed Time of 10:32:40, and ended about 16 minutes, 16 and a half minutes later, when the spacecraft was at an altitude of 52,248 nautical miles. We'll stand by for a replay of that transmission at 8:45pm Central Daylight Time.|P
0121138|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 12 minutes, and we expect to be ready to release the television transmission from the spacecraft which was received at Goldstone, California. That should be ready to go in a little less than a minute.|P
0121248|PAO|And we are starting to get lock-on from the tape replay and we expect that we will have a color picture shortly.|P
0122402|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The view we have of the Earth disc at this time as near as we can tell, the north Pole is to the left of the screen. The land mass that was visible was the western coast of the United States. The Earth then would appear to be rotated 90 degrees with the North Pole to the left and South American Continent extending toward the upper right of the globe but not visible.|P
0122941|PAO|That concludes the unscheduled television transmission. That transmission came in about 2 hours ago at a Ground Elapsed Time of 10:32:40 beginning, lasted about 16 and a half minutes. At the beginning of the transmission Apollo 11 was about 50,980 nautical miles from Earth and at the conclusion about 52,248 nautical miles. At the present time, the crew is in a scheduled rest period. They did indicate before going into the rest period, when we last heard from them, that they would probably use part of the time to get a bite to eat and then get some sleep. At this time Apollo 11 is 59,908 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,569 feet per second. At 12 hours 31 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.|P
0123635|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Hope you aren't - we aren't disturbing you. We'd like you to terminate the NOUN 65 now. Over.|T
0123643|CMP|Roger.|T
0124602|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0124606|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11 ...|T
0124609|CC|Roger, Buzz. When you stopped - or, correction - When you terminated the NOUN 65, it appears to us, you get a VERB 46 which collapsed the deadband back to 0.5. We're okay as long as you do not turn on any AUTO RCS SELECT switches. Over.|T
0124630|LMP|Okay. I thought that was a - better way to clear the DSKY but evidently it isn't. Roger.|T
0124637|CC|Roger. VERB 34 would have been a better procedure.|T
0124642|LMP|Yes. Thank you.|T
0124704|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 47 minutes. We've just put in a call to the crew. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, verified with the surgeon that they had not gone to sleep at this point and Capsule Communicator, Charlie Duke, has put in the call. We'll pick up the tape of the conversation and then stand by for any following live communication with the crew.|P
0125155|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We don't anticipate a great deal of further conversation with the crew. We expect they will attempt to get some sleep shortly. The conversation that just ended, we advised that through one of the computer programs, the deadband, or that area of excursions which the guidance system will allow before firing the RCS thrusters to correct it, had been narrowed from 30 degrees to 1/2 a degree. What this would mean, if the RCS jets were enabled, is that unless the crew reselected the 30 degree deadband, the jets would be firing more frequently to keep the spacecraft within the narrower limits. Since the spacecraft is very stable at this point, very few wobbling motions, it was felt that the narrower deadband was acceptable; the jets are not enabled, and the crew would not be disturbed by firing of the Reaction Control System jets even if the spacecraft moved out of the 1/2-degree deadband. In the event of any large excursions, which we would not expect, based on the Passive Thermal Control mode, used in Apollo 10, it would be possible to awaken the crew from the ground and have the situation corrected. We would not expect, however, for the spacecraft attitude to change significantly during the night, and we do intend to continue in the Passive Thermal Control mode as it is presently set up. At this time Apollo 11 is 61,509 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 7,449 feet per second, which would translate to about 5,000 miles an hour. At 12 hours 54 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0132709|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours, 27 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft now traveling at a speed of 7,279 feet per second, which would be about 4,963 miles an hour, and it's at a distance of 63,880 nautical miles from Earth. Our Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, appeared to be sleeping soundly at this time. Biomedical data on the other two crewmen indicates that they are still awake. We've had no further conversation with the spacecraft since our last report, and it appears that the crew will be getting some good rest either as scheduled or perhaps a little earlier than scheduled in the Flight Plan. At 13 hours, 28 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.|P
0140612|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 14 hours 6 minute into the flight of Apollo 11. The mission is progressing very smoothly. All spacecraft systems are functioning normally at this time, and the Flight Surgeon reports that all three crewmen appear to be sleeping. For Commander, Neil Armstrong, and Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, they appear to have begun sleeping about 5 minutes ago. Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins has been asleep for about an additional 30 minutes to an hour. At the present time Apollo 11 is 66,554 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of about 70 thousand, or rather 7,095 feet per second, which would be about 4,800 miles an hour. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report and, as I said, all 3 crewmen appear to be sleeping at this time. At 14 hours 7 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0142510|PAO|This is Apollo Control 14 hours, 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. The spacecraft, presently 67,819 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 7,012 feet per second. Here in Mission Control, the shift change is in progress. Flight Director, Glenn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers coming on to replace Gene Kranz and his white team. The Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be Ron Evans. And we anticipate that the change-of-shift briefing for this shift will begin in about 10 or 15 minutes. At 14 hours, 26 minutes this is Apollo Control.|P
0152758|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 15 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew still asleep according to Flight Surgeon, Ken Beers here in Mission Control. The flight crew is still sleeping soundly at this time according to the biomedical telemetry being beamed down to the displays on his console. Here in the Mission Control Operations Room, or MOCR as it's called, the Black Team of Flight Controllers is settling in for the night headed up by Flight Director Glen Lunney. Some 7 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. Distance and velocity now showing 72,009 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now 6,750 feet per second. And at 15 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0163807|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 hours, 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11, presently being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station. Geographically, the spacecraft is practically directly over or out from the Philippine Islands. Now showing some 5 hours and 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period, the crew still asleep at this time. Continuing to decelerate as the spacecraft gets out toward the changeover point between the Earth's sphere of influence and the Moon's sphere of influence. Velocity now showing 6,493 feet per second. Apollo 11 now out 76,453 nautical miles from the Earth. And at 16 hours, 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0173310|PAO|This is Apollo Control 17 hours 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now some 79,700 nautical miles out from Earth at a velocity of 6,320 feet per second. Telemetry display for the crew biomedical readings now shows all three men in a fairly deep sleep. The mean heart rates in the 40's for all three men. Command Module cabin pressure holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Cabin temperature is 63 degrees. No measurements on the Lunar Module in terms of cabin pressure in as much as the Lunar Module has not been activated and will not be until shortly before entering Lunar orbit and the first manning for the module is checked out, systems are checked out and closed back up again. Spacecraft analysis reports coming out of the back room here in Mission Control Center read like some of the ones in Apollo 10 toward the end of the mission when they were down to one page. And most of the entries are all systems performance normal, systems operation normal, no change from last report, et cetera, et cetera. In the spacecraft fuel cell, performance is normal. And the load sharing is shown within 3.2 amps. Cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen quantities now show total oxygen at 558 pounds, 279 pounds in each of the two tanks, 49 pounds of cryogenic hydrogen, 24.2 pounds in Tank 1, 24.8 in Tank 2. And the cryogenic system is performing normal. At 17 hours 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0183811|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 18 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now some 83,644 nautical miles out from Earth, continuing to decelerate in velocity. Now some 6,114 feet per second. The reveille time for the crew of Apollo 11 in some 3 hours and 50 minutes. All systems still functioning normally aboard the spacecraft as the crew continues their nine hour rest period. All measurements normal, as the Flight Controllers here watch the systems on telemetry and the displays here in the Control Center. At 18 hours 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0194308|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 19 hours, 43 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Crew now has some 2 hours, 46 minutes remaining in the scheduled sleep period. Distance out-bound from Earth now 87,409 nautical miles. Apollo 11's continuing to decelerate in velocity, now traveling at 5,930 feet per second. All going well in the Apollo 11 mission. Crew sleeping apparently in deep sleep. Systems still performing quite well. And at 19 hours, 43 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0203816|PAO|This is Apollo control 20 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. One hour 51 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. At this time, Apollo 11 on a line projected outward from Earth is directly over the southern tip of the Indian sub-continent. Distance now 90,509 nautical miles. Velocity continuing to decelerate, now 5,788 feet per second. The crew is still asleep at this time, and at 20 hours 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.|P
0213823|PAO|This is Apollo Control 21 hours, 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 now being tracked by the tracking station at Madrid. Some 51 minutes remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew of Apollo 11. When the sleep period ends depends on the business of the day, whether the Flight Controllers here and the Spacecraft Communicator wake the crew up, or whether they call in to begin the second day of translunar coast. Upon wakening, the Flight Plan calls for change of the carbon dioxide removers in the spacecraft cabin, a report on the differential pressure between the Lunar Module and the Command Module, update from the ground on consumables remaining. We will remain in the Passive Thermal Control mode through the hour-long eat period that follows the wakeup. After their breakfast meal, the Flight Plan calls for some navigation exercises using the sextant and the Program 23 computations of the onboard computer. These are star and Earth horizon sightings. Presently, Apollo 11 is some 93,885 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity, now 5,638 feet per second. At 21 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0224918|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 22 hours, 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew has been awake for some time according to the surgeon. Spacecraft Communicator here in Mission Control with the Green Team, Bruce McCandless, is standing by to make a call to the crew. He's in the process of taking over from Ron Evans. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth, has asked that he make a call to the crew. We're standing by for this call momentarily.|P
0225012|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0225018|LMP|Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.|T
0225021|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Good morning.|T
0225029|CC|When you're ready to copy, 11, I've got a couple of small Flight Plan updates and your consumables update, and the morning news, I guess. Over.|T
0225152|LMP|Apollo 11. ...|T
0225155|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0225159|LMP|Roger. Standing by for your updates. Over.|T
0225207|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. At time approximately 22:30 in the Flight Plan, in your post-sleep checklist, and in all other post-sleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. And in the CSM checklist on page Foxtrot 9-8: if you want to turn to that, we'd like to change the order of the steps in that. Over.|T
0225310|LMP|Stand by.|T
0225334|LMP|Okay. Page F 9-8. Go ahead.|T
0225337|CC|Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.|T
0225413|LMP|Roger. I copy. Is that AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A, MAIN B to be the ...|T
0225422|CC|Roger. It should be the second step in that procedure. At time 22:40, or when you get to it, we'd like to commence a charge on battery A. And at time 24:10, we have an updated attitude for your P52 and optics calibration. Over.|T
0225504|LMP|Okay. 24:10. Go ahead.|T
0225507|CC|Roger. P52 and optics calibration attitude: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, yaw 000.0. The nominal attitude that's pen-and-inked in for the P23 is still good. At time 25:30, approximately, after you complete P23, we're requesting a wastewater dump down to a nominal 25 percent. Over.|T
0225646|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Did you copy the attitudes and the wastewater dump? Over.|T
0225658|LMP|Roger, Bruce. ...|T
0225713|CC|11, this is Houston. We're not reading you at the present time. You're way down in the noise level. Stand by, please.|T
0225722|LMP|Okay. Standing by.|T
0225902|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.|T
0225907|LMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Loud and clear. How me?|T
0225910|CC|Okay. Beautiful. Did you copy the attitudes for the P52 and the wastewater dump? Over.|T
0225918|LMP|Roger. Okay. We note the battery charge as soon as we get around to it, and the attitude for the P52 optics CAL: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, and yaw all zeros. The attitude for the P23 as in the Flight Plan is okay; and I copy your battery charge. Crew status report as follows: sleep CDR 7, CMP 7, LMP 5.5. And we've completed the post-sleep checklist. Standing by for a consumable update. Over.|T
0230003|CC|Roger. We're requesting a wastewater dump at GET 25:30 down to a nominal 25 percent, and here we go with the consumables update. At GET of 22 hours, RCS total is minus 3.5 percent. Alfa minus 3.5 percent, Bravo minus 1.5 percent, Charlie minus 5.0 percent, minus 4.0 percent, H2 minus 2 pounds, O2 minus 4 pounds. Over.|T
0230057|LMP|Okay. Stand by.|T
0230107|LMP|I copied those consumables, and I'll read you back our RCS quantities. We got 86 percent in Alfa, 87 in Bravo, 88 in Charlie, and 90 in Delta. Over.|T
0230135|CC|Roger. I copy.|T
0230144|CC|And did you copy the wastewater request?|T
0230148|LMP|Roger. Waste water at - and we got the time on that, and it will be down to 25 percent.|T
0230154|CC|Okay.|T
0230644|LMP|Houston, 11.|T
0230649|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0230654|LMP|Roger. We've started charging battery A, and voltage started off a lot higher than I expected. It was just a little bit shy of 40. It looks like it's dropping down some now, the battery charge holder. Seemed to me yesterday when we were doing this on battery C, it started out initially, and it went lower, the battery charge holder. Over.|T
0230718|CC|Roger. Stand by a second, and I'll get some reading on that.|T
0230727|LMP|On charging battery A: now, it's at about 393 and - oh, about 1.5 amps. Looks like it's gradually increasing in the ...|T
0230740|CC|Roger. On our CM,.we're showing you at 39.11, and your current's about what you reported.|T
0230749|LMP|Okay. I guess you're happy, then.|T
0230756|CC|I think we're losing you in the noise again, 11. Stand by.|T
0231031|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0231037|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.|T
0231039|CC|Roger, 11. On your battery charging question, we feel that it's probably a difference between individual batteries; and it does seem to have gone away as sort of a startup transient here. Other factors that might conceivably have an influence on it would be battery temperature, things of this sort. EECOMM seems to feel that it's operating within the normal design limits. Over.|T
0231110|LMP|All right. Very good. Thank you.|T
0231112|CC|Okay.|T
0231407|CC|11, this is Houston. If you are interested in the morning news, I have a summary here from PAO. Over.|T
0231418|LMP|Okay. We're all listening.|T
0231420|CC|Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moonshot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moonstruck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities. Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster was found. Over.|T
0231806|LMP|Roger. Thank you, Bruce. Another thing on that number 2 item, we all ... before we left, and we hope we get a chance to see him another time. Over.|T
0231826|CC|Roger. And I understand he was down there and really enjoyed watching the launch. We all think it was pretty magnificent, and you all are doing great job up there.|T
0231838|CDR|Thank you.|T
0232207|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours 22 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from Earth is 99,308 nautical miles. Velocity is 5,411 feet per second. The spacecraft weight is 96,361 pounds. |P
0232250|PAO|A flight dynamics officer reports that in terms of distance Apollo 11 will reach the half-way mark at 25 hours 0 minutes 53 seconds. At that time the spacecraft will be 104,350 miles from both the Earth and the Moon.|P

0235701|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0235707|LMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.|T
0235709|CC|Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on the performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.|T
0235721|LMP|He's all ears.|T
0235722|CMP|Yes. Go ahead.|T
0235724|CC|Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today, and I'm sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth's horizon at the sub-stellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94, that's VERB 94, to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers. Over.|T
0235941|CMP|Well, Roger. Stand by one. We're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.|T
0235948|CC|Okay.|T
0240036|PAO|Apollo 11 is now going out of the Passive Thermal Control mode in which it was slowly rotating to maintain thermal balance. They're getting set up for the P23 activities. That's the mid-course navigation. Capcom, Bruce McCandless is passing up some changes in the procedures for this navigational operation.|P
0240208|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0240211|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0240214|CMP|Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to the P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you give me to go to for the sub-stellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.|T
0240245|CC|Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.|T
0240257|CMP|Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an excessive attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.|T
0240348|CC|Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.|T
0240424|CMP|Okay.|T
0241055|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.|T
0241059|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0241101|LMP|Roger. I'm getting ready to do an O2 Fuel cell purge. Do you have any particulars on this? And I assume you want these one at a time, or can I triple up? Over.|T
0241112|CC|We'd like them one at a time, and stand by. I don't think we have any sequence. You can do them in any order you want.|T
0241122|CMP|Okay.|T
0241126|CC|And we're watching you on TM down here.|T
0241500|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You want to look at these NOUN 93's before I proceed on them?|T
0241508|CC|Yes, please. Stand by a second.|T
0241511|CMP|Okay.|T
0241610|CC|11, this is Houston. On our TM, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. Can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?|T
0241621|CMP|Register 3: minus three balls 24.|T
0241628|CC|Roger. Minus three balls 24. And you can go ahead and proceed.|T
0241634|CMP|Okay. Proceeding at this time.|T
0241655|CC|11, Houston. After you've completed P52, we'd like to uplink you a new state vector so we can start out clean on this P23. Over.|T
0241707|CMP|Okay.|T
0241720|LMP|Houston, are you observing the higher O2 flow on fuel cell 3?|T
0241733|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It's triggered the MASTER ALARM three times, now. There goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4, then oscillates back down to about 1.1. Over.|T
0241747|CC|Roger. We saw them 1.3 now on TM. Stand by a second.|T
0241759|CMP|And we're in P00, now, for a state vector.|T
0241804|CC|Roger. Give us ACCEPT, please.|T
0241811|CMP|Roger. Done.|T
0241840|CC|11, Houston. On your O2 flow, fuel cell 3: apparently, it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate's acceptable. Over.|T
0241854|LMP|Roger, It seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also. Over.|T
0241903|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0241949|CC|11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours; you can go back to BLOCK.|T
0241957|CMP|Okay. Thank you.|T
0242029|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0242041|CDR|Houston, 11. I don't believe we were calling you right then.|T

0242352|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0242355|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.|T
0242400|CMP|Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star - what number is it? - star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?|T
0242421|CC|Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.|T
0242431|CMP|Okay.|T
0242434|CC|When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the sub-stellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to sub-stellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.|T
0242504|CMP|Yes. I believe.|T
0242506|CC|Roger. Over.|T
0242528|PAO|Star 37 is Nunki. Apollo 11 is now in Program 52 which is realignment of the platform prior to beginning the cislunar navigation operation.|P
0242923|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.|T
0242934|CC|That's certainly very sufficient.|T
0242939|CMP|Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a VERB 49 maneuver to your sub-stellar point. Okay?|T
0242951|CC|Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for the AUTO maneuver.|T
0243007|CMP|Okay.|T
0243015|CC|And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zeros?|T
0243021|CMP|Not yet.|T
0243022|CC|Okay.|T
0243052|CC|11, Houston. Over the past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure of CO2. Have you in fact changed the CO2 canister yet this morning? We don't need to do it right now; we'd just like to confirm it that our instrumentation is in good shape. Over.|T
0243112|CMP|No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.|T
0243119|CC|Okay. Then I guess you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.|T
0243132|CMP|All right.|T
0243156|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.|T
0243211|CC|Roger. We copy. And that is for star 01?|T
0243218|CMP|Star 01, right near the horizon. Code 110.|T
0243221|CC|Roger.|T
0244105|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver worked just fine. I am right at the sub-stellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.|T
0244119|CC|Roger. Is this for star 01?|T
0244123|CMP|That's correct.|T
0244130|CC|You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?|T
0244140|CMP|Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I've maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.|T
0244217|CC|Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.|T
0244247|CC|11, this is Houston. Can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters?|T
0244254|CMP|Yes. I will be glad to. Shaft 331.2 and trunnion 35.85.|T
0244303|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T
0244533|CMP|It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean. You could see all of North Africa, absolutely clear; all of Portugal, Spain, southern France; all of Italy, absolutely clear. Just a beautiful sight.|T
0244553|CC|Roger. We all envy you the view up there.|T

0244723|CC|Roger. On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the Flight Plan. Roll 177.2, pitch 298.2 and yaw 330.0. Over.|T

I put the mode switch from MANUAL back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight. So the delay here has been in going back to MANUAL and finding the star again, which I've finally done. And - Just a second here, I'll go to ENTER and get a 51 and mark on it.

Some larger and smaller islands of Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica. A little haze over the upper Italian peninsula, some cumulus clouds out over Greece. The Sun is setting on the eastern Mediterranean now. And, the British Isles are definitely greener in color than the brownish green that we have in the islands, in the peninsula of Spain. Over.|T

0271924|LMP|Well, you all are just beginning to come over the limb now. I can see parts of Central America, and it looks to be fairly - fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now, and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon. Over.|T

0272149|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0272151|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0272154|LMP|I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.|T
0272240|CC|Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.|T
0272255|LMP|Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?|T

0272533|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0272535|CC|Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?|T
0272543|CMP|Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. I'm still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that sub-stellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.|T
0272608|CC|How about the - -|T
0272609|LMP|... correction on that last ...|T
0272613|CC|How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy?|T
0272619|CMP|Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.|T
0272656|LMP|Hey, Jim.|T
0272658|CC|Go ahead, Buzz.|T
0272701|LMP|Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.|T
0272724|CC|Sounds good.|T
0272745|CC|How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?|T
0272751|LMP|Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.|T
0272803|CC|It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.|T
0272804|CMP|... kept me busy, I'm ...|T

0272816|CMP|Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.|T

0272847|LMP|Not where the waste management is concerned.|T
0272852|CDR|Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine through - throughout yesterday and last night, during the PTC, it cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.|T
0272928|CC|I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the walls?|T
0272939|CDR|No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.|T
0272948|LMP|One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one ounce, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.|T
0273013|CMP|Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a back-pressure problem. If the thing sees any back-pressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.|T
0273049|CC|Understand.|T
0273053|LMP|In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the gun, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.|T
0273104|CC|Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?|T
0273111|LMP|Yes. It seems reasonably warm.|T
0273115|CMP|We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.|T
0273147|CMP|Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now. How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?|T
0273155|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0273159|CC|We're all set to go, Mike.|T
0273202|CMP|Okay. I'll press on then.|T
0273558|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. PTC has started and it looks good.|T
0273605|CC|11, Roger. This is Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0274602|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours 46 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is now 112,386 nautical miles, velocity 4,906 feet per second. We now have the actual numbers on the mid-course correction maneuver. Ignition time was 26 hours 44 minutes 57.92 seconds. Duration of the burn was 2.91 seconds. DELTA-V 20.9 feet per second.|P
0274721|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0274725|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0274727|CC|Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O2 flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.|T
0274746|CDR|Stand by.|T
0274836|CDR|Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.|T
0274839|CC|Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O2 flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.|T
0274936|CDR|Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.|T
0274959|CC|Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.|T
0275013|CDR|Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.|T
0275018|CC|Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O2 flow on telemetry down here.|T
0275248|CDR|Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.|T
0275255|CC|11, this is Houston. Say again, please.|T
0275259|CDR|You do have the O2 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.|T
0275306|CC|Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.|T
0275311|CDR|That's affirm. It's in DUMP.|T
0275315|CC|Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O2 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.|T
0275335|CDR|Roger.|T
0280712|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0280715|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0280719|CMP|Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly, but - The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.|T
0280754|CC|Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.|T
0280759|CMP|Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We're rotating around where it's going out of view again.|T
0280807|PAO|That's Mike Collins talking.|P

0283032|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0283608|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you need some help keeping OMNI's locked on us?|T
0283614|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.|T
0283637|LMP|Okay. You've got it.|T
0283639|CC|Okay. One thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your LM/CM DELTA-P reading for about 28 hours GET. Over.|T
0283705|LMP|Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.|T
0283710|CC|Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O2 flow on your onboard gage? Over.|T
0283722|LMP|Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading off-scale-low. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.|T
0283750|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0283842|CC|And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.|T
0283905|LMP|Good to hear it.|T
0283907|CC|Roger. We thought you'd feel that way about it.|T
0283920|LMP|We're right in the middle of - well either ... drink, or salmon salad, or something like that. That's probably why we're not answering you right away.|T
0283931|CC|Okay. Well, we don't want - -|T
0283932|CMP|My compliments to the chef, that salad salmon is outstanding.|T
0283940|CC|Roger. Understand that's the salad salmon. Over.|T
0283948|CMP|Something like that, salmon salad.|T
0283950|CC|There we go, okay, the salmon salad, very good.|T
0283955|LMP|Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.|T
0284029|CC|Roger, We're copying that.|T
0284056|PAO|At 28 hours 40 minutes, we're showing Apollo 11's distance as 114,922 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 4,819 feet per second. The crew is eating lunch at the present time, and it sounds like there's some music in the background that they are enjoying during their lunch period.|P
0284125|CC|11, Houston.|T
0284129|CDR|Go ahead.|T
0284131|CC|Roger. On that O2 flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.|T
0284203|LMP|Okay. It's a tight fix then.|T
0284205|CMP|We run a tight ship.|T
0284208|CC|(laughter) Roger. Is that music I hear in the background?|T
0284215|CMP|Buzz in singing.|T
0284216|CC|Okay.|T

0293208|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0293213|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0293214|CC|Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. Over.|T
0293255|LMP|Okay. What do you recommend?|T
0293258|CC|Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.|T
0293320|LMP|Roger. I understand.|T
0293321|CC|Okay.|T
0293338|CDR|And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?|T
0293359|CC|Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.|T
0293408|CDR|Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't very far west of you.|T
0293417|CC|Okay.|T
0293420|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.|P
0295815|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0295821|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0295823|CC|11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, why, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.|T
0295928|CDR|Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?|T
0295944|CC|Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.|T
0300009|CDR|Okay. We understand. Thank you.|T

0300326|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a correction on those last distances and velocities. That distance and velocity is in reference to the Moon instead of the Earth. To the Moon - Apollo 11's distance from the Moon is 105,729 nautical miles at the present time and the velocity in reference to the Moon is 4,230 feet per second.|P
0301219|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like you to terminate charging on battery A at GET 30 plus 15. Over.|T

0301617|LMP|Roger. Standing by to copy.|T
0301621|CC|Okay. TLI plus 35 PAD: the DELTA-VT should be 7992 instead of 8016. TLI plus 44 - It should be 6112 instead of 6141. And TLI plus 53 - It should be 8172 instead of 8209. Read back. Over.|T

0303059|LMP|Well, I guess if they can't see any numbers, why, it's kind of a lost cause.|T
0303103|CC|Negative. Standby. We wanted to know - -|T
0303105|LMP|...|T
0303106|CC|We wanted to know what numbers before we asked them.|T
0303111|LMP|Okay. I'm showing them the DSKY, and I'd like to know whether they can read what's showing on the DSKY, and also whether they can see P-R-O-G, V-E-R-B, and N-O-U-N. Over.|T

0303128|CT|Capcom, Goldstone. Go ahead.|T
0303130|CC|Roger. Did you copy the spacecraft request?|T
0303133|CT|That's affirmative. I am reading the numbers on our monitor here.|T
0303137|CC|Okay, that's - standby - Roger. That's both the numbers on the DSKY itself, and the little words like PROGRAM and VERB, NOUN, COMPUTER ACTIVITY, things of this sort?|T
0303158|CT|Roger. I can read the numbers clearly. We can't distinguish what the words are, because it is a little snowy.|T
0303207|CC|Roger.|T
0303210|CT|Okay. I read VERB, NOUN, and PROGRAM.|T
0303218|CC|Roger. Do you see - Over in the left-hand corner, there's a big square one that says COMPUTER ACTIVITY, COMP ACTIVITY?|T
0303225|CT|Roger. I see a flash occasionally in that area.|T
0303227|CC|Roger. that's the one.|T
0303230|CT|Okay. It looks like he's moved the camera at this time.|T
0303233|CC|Roger.|T
0303235|CC|11, this is Houston. Goldstone M&O reports that they can read the numbers on the DSKY. They can also read VERB, NOUN, PROGRAM, and see the COMP ACTIVITY light flashing. Over.|T

0305126|CC|Oh, the old White Team's bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. We're ever alert down here.|T
0305133|CMP|Ever alert depends on - Hey, you got any medics down there watching heart rate? I'm trying to do some running in place down here, and I'm wondering just out of curiosity whether it brings my heart rate up.|T

0305212|CC|Hello, 11. We see your heart beating.|T
0305217|CMP|Okay, Well - look at the CDR's and the CMP's and see if they go up any. We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.|T
0305225|CC|I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.|T
0305231|CMP|I think Buzz is trying.|T
0305234|LMP|You got it.|T
0305235|CC|Okay. It's coming in at Goldstone, Buzz. As Bruce said, we don't have it here in the center.|T
0305258|LMP|I'm afraid this isn't going to help out the PTC very much.|T
0305305|CMP|Yes. I don't know if it's a vibration or what it is, but it makes the pitch and yaw rate needles on FDAI number 1 jump up and down a little bit where we jump up and down.|T
0305318|CC|Rog. Rog, Goldstone has said they see you running there, Mike.|T
0305328|CMP|Okay.|T
0305330|LMP|Ask him what he's running from.|T
0305347|CC|11, Houston. Mike, we see about a 96 heartbeat now.|T
0305355|CMP|Okay. Thank you.|T
0305427|CMP|Well, that's about all that is reasonable, without getting hot and sweaty.|T
0305431|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0305759|CMP|Goldstone should be getting about the best picture of the Earth we can give them right now, Charlie.|T
0305803|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you much.|T
0305807|LMP|We've got a tittle distortion in the horizontal direction from banding on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing?|T

0305905|CT|Stand by.|T
0305913|LMP|They wouldn't see anything now. We don't have anything in focus, Charlie.|T
0305919|CC|Roger. He's checking on it. I'll see if they had it earlier. Stand by.|T
0305928|LMP|I guess when we're showing the DSKY or when we're showing the Earth might be the better time.|T
0305934|CC|Okay.|T
0305940|CT|Houston Capcom, Goldstone.|T
0305941|CC|Go ahead.|T
0305942|CT|Okay. Our TV people confirm they see this horizontal band.|T
0305946|CC|Okay.|T
0305950|CC|11, Houston. The Goldstone TV people also see the banding when - at the same time you all do. Over.|T
0310001|LMP|Okay. Would they call it a horizontal waviness, instead of banding, maybe?|T
0310006|CC|I'm not talking to them directly. Stand by, Buzz. Let me see how they describe it.|T
0310012|CC|Goldstone M&0, Houston Capcom. Could you put the TV guy on the loop, please?|T

0310109|CC|Okay. Going to NET 2.|T
0310203|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.|T
0310223|LMP|Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.|T
0310230|CC|Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.|T
0310235|LMP|Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.|T
0310244|CC|Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.|T
0310329|CC|Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.|T
0310347|LMP|Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.|T
0310351|CC|Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.|T

0311426|CC|Stand by.|T
0311446|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNIs on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.|T
0311501|CMP|Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high-gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.|T
0311520|CC|Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.|T
0311524|CMP|Okay.|T
0311847|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got some PIPA biases and general drift updates for you if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.|T
0311901|CMP|Okay, Charlie. Stand by one.|T
0311903|CC|Roger, 11. The - -|T
0311904|CMP|You've got it.|T
0311906|CC|Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYROs is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so we're just trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYROs and accelerometers.|T
0311933|CMP|Sounds good.|T
0311936|CC|The system really looks good to us.|T
0311942|CMP|Glad to hear it, Charlie.|T
0312030|CC|11, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK. We've got the load in.|T
0312038|CMP|Okay. Roger.|T
0312148|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 22 minutes. We're scheduled to begin the change-of-shift briefing shortly. During the briefing we will record any conversations with the crew and play those back following the briefing. At 31 hours, 22 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0312224|CMP|Boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. Right now, Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he can with his arms reach - all five windows, He can reach down into - the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.|T
0312247|CC|Sounds like Plastic Man to me.|T
0312300|CMP|I'm hiding under the left-hand couch trying to stay out of his way.|T
0312304|CC|Be a good idea, Mike.|T
0312517|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. You got a cloud over the Houston area right now?|T
0312522|CC|Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.|T
0312532|LMP|Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.|T
0312543|CC|Roger.|T
0312543|LMP|Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.|T
0312548|CC|Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.|T
0312558|LMP|That view through this sextant is fantastic.|T
0312610|LMP|I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the cross hairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.|T
0312644|CC|Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.|T
0312650|CMP|The guys in the weather office at Patrick wanted a report on the tops but I guess all we can say is we're above them.|T
0312658|CC|Roger. We'll pass it on to METRO.|T
0312709|CC|11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.|T
0312725|LMP|Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.|T
0312738|CC|Roger.|T
0322109|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 21 minutes. During the change-of-shift Press Conference we had about 3 minutes of conversation with the crew. During that conversation, Buzz Aldrin reported on - what appeared to be a weather disturbance off Cuba and the Caribbean and we also had some descriptions from Aldrin on the view of Earth from the spacecraft's present position. We'll played that back for you now and then stand by for any further live conversation with the crew.|P
0322457|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.|T
0322516|LMP|Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.|T
0322523|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we've got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.|T
0322542|LMP|Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.|T
0322547|CC|Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. high-gain angles: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.|T
0322628|LMP|Roger. We copy roll 21 - 261, pitch 090, yaw 000, high-gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.|T
0322645|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0322701|CMP|Charlie, Apollo 11. I got a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?|T
0322746|CC|Sounds pretty good. Stand by one.|T
0322750|CMP|Sounds like it might save a little gas.|T
0322906|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. What page do you want in that revision? Over.|T
0322911|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-20. Over.|T
0322928|LMP|Okay, I have it.|T
0322932|CC|Roger, 11. Under column A on page F2-20, line 5, line 05, the new data is 01042; line 07, the new data is 00256. Skipping down to line 11, 00070; line 12 is 00042; line 13 is 77730. In column Bravo, lines 3, 4, and 5, which are blank, should be all zeros for line 3; line 4 is 20017; line 5 20616. Over.|T
0323111|LMP|Roger. Page F2-20, column Alfa: 05, 01042; 07, 00256; 11, I'll say again. 11, 00070; 12, 00042; 13, 77730. Column Bravo: 03, 00000; 04, 20017; 05, 20616. Over.|T
0323209|CC|Roger. Good readback, Buzz. And stand by, Mike, on the coming-out-of-the-PTC recommendation. Over.|T
0323218|CMP|Okay. Fine.|T
0323306|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with a recommendation on exiting PTC. Over.|T
0323313|CMP|Go ahead.|T
0323314|CC|Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.|T
0323336|CMP|Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.|T
0323344|CC|Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.|T
0323357|CMP|Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.|T
0323400|CC|Roger.|T
0323859|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 39 minutes. This is a relative quiet period in the Flight Plan. The crew will be getting the spacecraft set up for the Passive Thermal Control termination, and the Television transmission. Capcom Charlie Duke has just put in a call. We'll pick that up.|P
0323910|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with some more words on exiting PTC. Over.|T
0323918|CMP|Go ahead, Charlie.|T
0323920|CC|Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.|T
0324012|CMP|Sounds like a winner.|T
0324014|CC|Okay.|T
0324033|CMP|I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.|T
0324038|CC|You sound like you'd better protect it. It looks like just about anything that you do with that DSKY is going to collapse that deadband back down.|T
0324049|CMP|Understand.|T
0324313|CMP|Charlie, we just STABED to 261 degrees roll, and it looks like whoever figured it out did a good job. It's right there, dab-smack in the middle of window number 1.|T
0324323|CC|Sounds great.|T
0324600|CMP|Looks like Houston's still got a little smog over it, Charlie.|T
0324604|CC|We've got a constant overcast here in the room. We'll be right there. Stand by.|T
0324613|CMP|Of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states.|T
0324631|CC|11, Houston. Some of our guys just came in from outside and said it's pretty clear over the center here. It's cleared up completely. All the storms have moved on.|T
0324642|CMP|Okay, good.|T
0324916|CMP|Oh, yes, Charlie. I can see it through the sextant now, and I can see the coastline is clear. Those clouds are just inland a few miles.|T
0324925|CC|Okay. We copy.|T
0324949|CMP|Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.|T
0325003|CMP|California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.|T
0325018|CC|How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?|T
0325024|CMP|Yes. As usual.|T
0325027|CC|Roger. |T
0325027|CMP|The ... - It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.|T
0325048|CC|Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.|T
0325057|CMP|I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.|T
0325103|CC|Hey, man. That's super.|T
0325106|CMP|Pretty safe bet; there's almost always a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.|T
0325147|CC|11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.|T
0325155|CMP|Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.|T
0325222|CC|Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Mike.|T
0325227|CMP|Right.|T
0325233|PAO|Mike Collins is sending us this description from about 126,000 miles from Earth.|P
0325238|CMP|How far out are we, Charlie?|T
0325241|CC|Stand by. I'll give it to you exactly. Looks like around 130,000, but stand by.|T
0325247|CMP|Okay.|T
0325315|CC|11, Houston. The exact range is 125,200 miles, and you're traveling 4,486 feet per second.|T
0325328|CMP|Pretty far and pretty slow. Just past halfway.|T
0325348|CMP|Hey, Charlie, what the latest on Luna 15?|T
0325353|CC|Say again, Buzz? Over.|T
0325357|LMP|Roger. What's the latest on Luna 15?|T
0325401|CC|Stand by. I'll get the straight story for you.|T
0333348|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 34 minutes. We've been advised that we are getting a television transmission from Goldstone at the present time. This is an unscheduled TV transmission apparently of the crew checking out their onboard system.|P
0333457|PAO|We have lost lock on the high-gain antenna at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 127,991 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4,400 feet per second. The regularly scheduled time for the television transmission is 6:47pm Central Daylight Time, and we are anticipating that that transmission will occur as scheduled.|P
0333730|PAO|We're getting momentary lock-on. We seem to have a somewhat better picture now. Here's a call to the crew from Capcom Charlie Duke.|P
0333744|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.|T
0333748|CMP|Go ahead, Charlie.|T
0333750|CC|Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.|T
0333817|CMP|Okay. Thank you, Charlie.|T
0333819|CC|And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.|T
0333846|CMP|Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.|T
0334108|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 41 minutes. We are going to be standing by here in Mission Control for the possibility that the crew would want to transmit that television pass early. The scheduled time for it was 6:47 Central Daylight Time and about 15 minutes was scheduled. That would be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 34 hours and we will have the system set up here in Mission Control to receive and release television should the crew decide to send us the transmission early.|P
0334503|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 45 minutes and we do have a correction to the time given for the beginning of that TV nominally. The Flight Plan time is beginning at 34 hours to 34 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The previous conversion of that, that we gave you for Central Daylight Time was in error, it should be 6:32pm Central Daylight Time beginning, assuming we start as the Flight Plan nominally has a transmission listed at 34 hours Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 128,431 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off slowly, now reads 4,386 feet per second.|P
0334754|PAO|You've heard that comment from the crew. They've stopped their Passive Thermal Control, they're starting up the TV and we'll be standing by for - for a picture.|P
0334756|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.|T
0334802|CC|Roger.|T
0335230|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.|T
0335251|LMP|Roger, Charlie. Buzz here. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.|T
0335256|CC|Roger. You are about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. Over.|T
0335308|LMP|Okay. I moved my mike around. How about now? Is this any better?|T
0335312|CC|Hey, that's beautiful right there. Thank you.|T
0335316|CMP|Okay, Charlie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?|T
0335321|CC|Roger. You're five-by. Is Neil on?|T
0335324|CDR|1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.|T
0335327|CC|Roger, Neil. You're five-by.|T
0335715|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours 57 minutes and we are less than 3 minutes now from the scheduled television transmission. From Apollo 11, we're continuing to standby for that. We have also been asked to advised that the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10:00pm has been postponed for 24 hours. To repeat, the Delta launch of INTELSAT III scheduled for Friday night at 10:00pm has been postponed for 24 hours. Further details on that will be available in the News Center.|P
0335908|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.|T
0335945|CC|Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.|T
0335952|CDR|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.|T
0340006|CC|Roger.|T
0340011|PAO|This view is coming to us from about 129,000 nautical miles.|P
0340116|CC|11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.|T
0340131|CDR|Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.|T
0340344|CC|Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud formations trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.|T
0340412|CDR|Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.|T
0340453|CC|Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloud band trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.|T
0340525|CDR|I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.|T
0340535|CC|Roger.|T
0340541|CC|You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.|T
0340609|CC|It appears that the - -|T
0340610|CDR|Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.|T
0340618|CC|Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.|T
0340631|CDR|Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast, although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer ranges.|T
0340703|CC|Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the Control Center. Over.|T
0340720|CMP|Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.|T
0340749|CC|11, that's a pretty good roll, there.|T
0340802|CMP|Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.|T
0340811|CC|You'll never beat out the thunderbirds.|T
0340837|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That practice did you some good. It's looking - real smooth roll, there.|T
0340842|CC|Oops! Spoke too soon.|T
0340852|CMP|I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.|T
0340857|CC|Roger.|T
0340901|CMP|You don't get to do that every day.|T
0340911|CC|11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloud-cap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.|T
0340946|LMP|Trying to fit everybody into the window.|T
0340949|CDR|It appears that the cloud-cap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.|T
0341002|CC|Roger.|T
0341010|CC|We've - 11, we've lost our picture here, now.|T
0341023|CC|Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.|T
0341035|CDR|Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.|T
0341046|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0341050|CC|11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.|T
0341105|CDR|Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.|T
0341107|CC|Roger.|T
0341231|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.|T
0341245|CDR|That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.|T
0341250|CC|Roger.|T
0341256|CC|We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.|T
0341310|CMP|It's a floodlight.|T
0341311|CC|Roger.|T
0341314|CC|Now we're coming in. Can't quite make out who that ...|T
0341324|CC|That's big Mike Collins, there - -|T
0341325|CMP|You got a little bit of - Yes, hello there sports fans. You got a little bit of me, plus Neil is in the center couch, and Buzz is doing the camera work at this time.|T
0341334|CC|Roger. It's a little dark now, 11. Maybe a bigger f-stop might help.|T
0341344|CMP|Yes, that's in work.|T
0341405|CC|It's getting a lot better now, 11. Mike, you're coming in five-by. I got a good -|T
0341414|CMP|I would have put on a coat and tie if I'd known about this ahead of time.|T
0341418|CC|Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you? Over.|T
0341425|CMP|Cue cards have a no. We have no intention of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.|T
0341505|CC|Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - when you - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.|T
0341535|CMP|Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.|T
0341539|CC|Roger.|T
0341550|CMP|He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.|T
0341557|CC|Roger. We can see portions of the LEB now. The systems test meter panel, in the lower part of the picture, or we did have it, anyway.|T
0341609|CMP|Okay. And directly behind his head are our optical instruments, the sextant and the telescope that we use to take sightings with.|T
0341619|CC|Roger. Copy. And we see the DSKY flashing with a 651. In fact, we can read registers 1 and 2 quite clearly.|T
0341631|CMP|We have the old high-gain angles telling us which way the Earth is.|T
0341635|CC|Copy. That's a beautiful picture. Clarity is outstanding.|T
0341646|CMP|We can also give you the time of day in our system of Mission Elapsed Time. Elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. Can you see that clearly enough, Charlie?|T
0341659|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. We can see it counting up every - every second. We got 34:17:02 now.|T
0341713|CMP|Okay. Back to the high-gain angles.|T
0341715|CC|Roger.|T
0341718|CMP|Now we have amputated those.|T
0341745|CC|11, Houston. We have a beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around. ... That looks like the star charts coming into view, now. Over.|T
0341758|CMP|Yes. Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the right-hand window, window number 5.|T
0341806|CC|Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.|T
0341820|CMP|Roger. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. They're just for show.|T
0341827|CC|We copy.|T
0341828|LMP|While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will be in eclipsed - it will be eclipsing the Sun as we go behind it, as we approach the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver.|T
0341919|CC|Roger, 11. We've - Could you attempt a little bit better focus there, 11? Over.|T
0342001|CC|11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.|T
0342019|CMP|Okay, Charlie.|T
0342042|LMP|If we can get some of the wires untangled here, we'll give you a demonstration of how easy push-ups are up here.|T
0342052|CC|11, Roger. Good view of Buzz, there.|T
0342124|LMP|When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.|T
0342129|CC|Roger. We copy. We couldn't figure out whether that was a chin-up or a push-up. just take your choice, I guess.|T
0342205|CMP|Well, it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there, Earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.|T
0342214|CC|11, Roger.|T
0342238|CC|11, Houston. We see a box full of goodies there. Over.|T
0342243|CMP|We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, and beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.|T
0342304|CC|Roger.|T
0342310|CMP|Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew.|T
0342345|CC|Sounds delicious.|T
0342356|CMP|Yes. The food so far has been very good. We couldn't be happier with it.|T
0342400|CC|Roger.|T
0342401|CMP|Could I borrow that flashlight a second?|T
0342404|CC|The surgeons are saying thank you, there, for that.|T
0342409|CMP|And it is sort of down in a dark corner, so we have a flashlight here to help us see things; and if I can let go of it carefully, it'll just hold itself right where it is.|T
0342423|CC|Roger.|T
0342425|CMP|As long as ... disturbed it will.|T
0342435|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there, Mike. It's -|T
0342444|CMP|Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.|T
0342459|CC|It looks fairly stable now with slow rotation.|T
0342528|CMP|Well, so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.|T
0342533|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0342538|LMP|Charlie, we checked out the cable lengths, and we're thinking we might want to see if we can take the TV into the LM with us tomorrow for part of the time. Over.|T
0342549|CC|Roger. Good show. We'd like to see it if it'll reach that far. Over.|T
0342557|LMP|We'll give it a try.|T
0342559|CC|Roger.|T
0342630|CMP|And where I sleep is down underneath this couch.|T
0342637|CC|Houston. Roger.|T
0342642|CC|Slowly sinking into the sack there.|T
0342651|CMP|It's really comfortable.|T
0342701|CMP|Forgot to give Buzz his flashlight back.|T
0342722|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give the folks a view of your patch if - on your CWGs? Over.|T
0342737|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie; we'll try and give you a closeup.|T
0342740|CC|Roger.|T
0342752|CC|11, Houston. We have the patch. Could you attempt to improve the focus slightly? Over.|T
0342813|CC|11, Houston. The scan on the camera makes the - that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker, due to the scan on the TV. We can't see the Eagle. Now it's a little bit better. Over. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Over.|T
0342841|CMP|It's open all the way. We're going to have to move Buzz around a little bit.|T
0342844|CC|Roger.|T
0342923|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. The color's better now. It's coming in. We could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There we go; it focuses a lot better now. We see the Eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. Over. That's very good now.|T
0342956|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the Eagle coming in.|T
0343005|CMP|It's probably pretty hard to see the olive branch, isn't it?|T
0343007|CC|Roger. It is.|T
0343012|CMP|Well, that's what he has in his talons, is an olive branch.|T
0343016|CC|Copy.|T
0343039|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console, and we can see the DSKY up on the panel. Over.|T
0343132|CMP|That would be nice if you could take a look at all the circuit breakers; make sure the right ones are in and the right ones are out.|T
0343138|CC|Roger. Big Brother's watching.|T
0343143|CMP|And we're glad of it.|T
0343152|CMP|Boy, you guys have sure been doing a good job of watching us, Charlie. We appreciate it.|T
0343156|CC|The spacecraft's been beautiful, 11. We've really no complaints at all. Looks - Things are really great.|T
0343210|CMP|Can you see this DSKY on the MDC?|T
0343213|CC|That's affirmative. It appears that - can't quite tell what program - well, looks like we're in P00. We see you punching in a VERB 35, I think it is. Over.|T
0343228|CMP|Yes. Might as well tell the EECOMM's - or tell the GNC and everybody to hold on to their hat and I'll push the ENTER button.|T
0343236|CC|Roger.|T
0343241|CC|Roger. We see a real display now.|T
0343256|CC|That's a good demonstration of how the crew has the interface with the computer, talking to the programs and all, that we have in the computer.|T
0343309|CMP|Well, that's right, Charlie. Sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us.|T
0343414|CC|11, Houston, We just lost our pic - I see we're going back outside now. Over.|T
0343429|SC|...|T
0343431|CC|11, Houston. Do you copy? Over.|T
0343435|CDR|Roger. We copy, and as we pan back out to the distance at which we see the Earth, well, it's Apollo 11 signing off.|T
0343449|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. Thank you much for the show. It's a real good half hour. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Out.|T
0343520|PAO|This is Apollo control. That TV transmission lasted about 35 minutes.|P
0343522|CMP|Okay. That's it, Charlie.|T
0343524|CC|11, Houston. We appreciate the show. Thank you very much. Over.|T
0343528|CMP|Right.|T
0343548|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you key ERROR RESET on the DSKY, please? Over.|T
0343559|CDR|Okay. We should be straightened out now, Charlie, and back in P00.|T
0343644|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How do we stand on this O2 fuel cell purge? You want to go ahead and do that as scheduled in the Flight Plan?|T
0343651|CC|Stand by, 11. Over.|T
0343654|CMP|Okay.|T
0343658|CC|11, Houston. You can commence the O2 fuel cell purge now if you'd like. Over.|T
0343704|CMP|Okay. Fine.|T
0343712|CMP|While Buzz is doing that, I'll change the lithium hydroxide.|T
0343716|CC|Roger.|T
0344143|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0344147|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.|T
0344148|CC|Roger, Buzz. The attitude that we're in right now is a convenient one to start PTC in. We'd be satisfied with this attitude. So we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta; and we'll wait about 5 to 10 minutes, and than we'll establish the PTC. Over.|T
0344210|LMP|Roger. Disable Charlie and Delta, and we'll wait before starting PTC.|T
0344216|CC|Roger.|T
0344431|KRANZ|Retro, you got your BLOCK data?|T
0344618|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 46 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of about 4,300 feet per second. During the TV transmission the crew advised that they may possibly be able to take the color television camera into the Lunar Module with them tomorrow at about 56 hours, 30 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time. They reported that the cables had been checked and are appeared to be long enough to take them into the Lunar Module. During the next hour or so the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving on, getting the crew set up for their rest period and eat period. This will be a very long rest period tonight, scheduled 10 hours. That will begin according to the Flight Plan, at about 37 hours, Ground Elapsed Time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the Flight Plan, that perhaps again tonight we would be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early. At 34 hours, 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0345317|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Over.|T
0345326|LMP|Okay. We'll get it going.|T
0345958|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0350003|CC|Roger. Go ahead.|T
0350008|CMP|Roger. This time the DAP didn't like 0.3. It's - We followed the procedures; we got down to 70 000 ENTER. It took off at about 0.7.|T
0350021|CC|Roger. We're copying that. Stand by.|T
0350039|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like high-gain back?|T
0350043|CC|Roger. And you - Would you select ATTITUDE HOLD? Over.|T
0350109|CDR|Houston. Would you say again what your request is?|T
0350114|CC|Roger, 11. We'd like you to go back to ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.|T
0350122|CDR|Roger.|T
0350123|CC|11, Houston. Looks like we're going to have to reinitialate - reinitialize this PTC.|T
0350130|CDR|All right.|T
0350141|CMP|Okay. Do you have any roll angle that you'd like to stop it in, Charlie? I haven't stopped it yet.|T
0350147|CC|Stand by.|T
0350155|CC|11, Houston. It's your preference. Right now if you want to. Over.|T
0350202|CMP|Okay.|T
0350747|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0350751|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0350753|CC|Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in a number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to damp out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.|T
0350837|CMP|Okay. That sounds good, Charlie. When you get to the VERB 49, I'd like for you to give me the three gimbal angles that you want loaded.|T
0350844|CC|Roger. We'll do. Over.|T
0350848|CMP|Thank you.|T
0350849|CC|And Apollo 11, Houston. We have your flyby PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.|T
0350856|CMP|Stand by one.|T
0350931|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Is that P30 PAD?|T
0350933|CC|That's affirmative. Over.|T
0350941|LMP|Okay. Ready to copy.|T
0350942|CC|All right, Buzz. It's - flyby is the purpose. SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 097, minus 020 070 54 5944, minus 00028, plus 00023, plus 00069 029 149 312, apogee is NA, plus 00221 00078 001 00034, sextant star 01 2185 227, boresight star is NA; NA NA. Latitude is minus 0265, minus 16500, 11899 36228, 144 56 47. In the comments: your set stars are Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068. No ullage. It's a docked burn using the PTC REFSMMAT. Stand by for your readback. Over.|T
0351241|LMP|Okay. Would you give me GET of O.05g again, please?|T
0351248|CC|Roger. 144 56 47. Over.|T

0351310|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently about 93,265 nautical miles from the Moon and with respect to the Moon is traveling at a speed of about 4,019 feet per second. At this time we are receiving the tape play-back which Goldstone, the tracking site at Goldstone, California received from the spacecraft in that earlier unscheduled TV transmission. This was a test of the system using the spacecraft on the antennas, the small omni-directional antennas. Normally transmissions from this distance in space would be - would require the high-gain antenna. This television transmission is being processed and converted to color and we anticipate that we'll have it available for playback at about 9:00pm. We are in conversation with the spacecraft at this time. We'll pick up the tape recorded conversation that we have and then stand by to follow any live conversation.|P
0351412|CC|Roger. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. I copy - I read 029. Over.|T
0351421|LMP|Roger. 029.|T
0351422|CC|Roger. Good readback.|T
0351438|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. On the 0.7 rate, the rate loaded into the DAP is 0.1 or 0.2.|T
0351448|CC|11, Roger.|T
0351746|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.|T
0351750|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go.|T
0351753|CC|Roger, Mike. Would you please copy down your VERB 16, NOUN 20 ICDU angles now, then execute a VERB 49 and load that - those angles, the NOUN 20 that you see on the DSKY into the VERB - into the NOUN 22 slot; and PRO on that, and that will start our 20-minute rate period. Over.|T
0351818|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll do that right now in just a matter of interest. Those numbers are plus 04511, plus 09021, and plus 35984. Over.|T
0351831|CC|Roger.|T
0352013|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I've done that and, of course, I got an immediate 50 18. So I guess we're set up to proceed from here, and I'll start the 20-minute timer.|T
0352020|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0352044|CMP|Houston. I still question that 0.7 rate with 0.2 loaded into the DAP, though. Could you explain that one?|T
0352050|CC|Roger. We're working on it. Standby one.|T
0352054|CMP|Okay.|T
0352542|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0352547|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0352549|CC|Roger. We got a little laser visual experiment we'd like to - for you to do for us. If - if you got the Earth through any of your windows or through the telescope, would you so advise? Over.|T
0352608|CMP|Stand by one, Charlie.|T
0352614|CMP|At this roll attitude, what should our high-gain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see you in the lens.|T
0352623|CC|Stand by.|T
0352726|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Those high-gain angles are pitch minus 70, yaw 90. We think the Earth is apparently pretty close to plus z-axis. Over.|T
0352739|CMP|Okay.|T
0352759|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope.|T
0352807|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. We've got a laser that we're going to - It's a blue-green laser that we're going to flash on and off at a frequency of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of McDonald Observatory near El Paso, which is - should be right on the terminator - or right inside the terminator. We are going to activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see if you can see it. Over.|T
0352841|CMP|Telescope? Or sextant?|T
0352845|CC|Either one. Over.|T
0352848|CMP|Okay, I'll try it with the telescope; and if I don't see it there, then I'll try the sextant.|T
0352853|CC|Roger. We'll give you the word when they've got it turned on. Over.|T
0352858|CMP|Okay.|T
0352944|CC|11, Houston. They don't have it turned on yet. We'll give you the word when they got it turned on. Over.|T
0352950|CMP|Okay.|T
0353042|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We noticed the CRYO pressure dropped a moment ago. Did you stir up the CRYO's? Over.|T
0353049|LMP|Roger. We've finished our cycling operations.|T
0353052|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.|T
0353352|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. McDonald's got the laser turned on, Would you take a look? Over.|T
0353402|CMP|Okay, Charlie.|T
0353404|CC|It's bluish-green.|T
0353648|CC|11, Houston. We got some shaft and trunnion for you that might tweak it up a little bit. Shaft of 141.5, trunnion of 39.5. Over.|T
0353706|CDR|Okay. Stand by.|T
0353855|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. If you see it, it should be coming up - appear to be coming up, through the clouds. McDonald reports that there's a break in the clouds that they're beaming this thing through. Over.|T
0353908|CDR|Roger.|T
0353954|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the exercise on the Laser. Our rates are steady enough now for - to commence the PTC. Over.|T
0354006|CMP|Okay, Houston. Neither Neil nor Mike can see it. Incidentally, those shafts and trunnions just missed pointing at the world.|T
0354017|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T
0354026|LMP|As we are looking at it through the scanning telescope, it would be about a - oh, maybe a third of an Earth radii high and to the left.|T
0354037|CC|Roger.|T
0354039|LMP|But, we did - but we did identify the El Paso area and it appeared to us to be a break in the clouds there, and we looked in that break and saw nothing.|T
0354048|CC|Roger. Thank you much. Out.|T
0354306|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Over.|T
0354308|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.|T
0354313|CMP|Were you following that on the DSKY?|T
0354317|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0354327|CC|11, Houston. What's your exact question? Over.|T
0354334|CMP|I've followed the procedure through step 7 down to the point where I've got 27303 ENTER, and this resulted in an OPERATOR ERROR LIGHT.|T
0354347|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0354504|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Stand by a moment. We'll have an answer for you momentarily. Over.|T
0354511|CMP|Okay. Appreciate it, Charlie. Now the light's gone out without any further DSKY action.|T
0354516|CC|Roger.|T
0354517|CMP|Correction. Stand by; that's not so.|T
0354522|CC|Roger.|T
0355706|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.|T
0355711|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0355713|CC|Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 50 18, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDUs, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.|T
0355804|CMP|Okay. I think that's what we did last time.|T
0355810|CC|It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDUs. Over.|T
0355826|CMP|Okay.|T
0360103|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We're moving at the proper rate.|T
0360106|CC|Hallelujah!|T
0360152|CC|11, Houston. It looks great to us now. Over.|T
0360159|CMP|It looks fine here, Charlie. The 0.7 part is the only part I don't find explained yet.|T
0360206|CC|Roger, Mike. We're working on that one right now. We're coming up with the story soon. Over.|T
0360214|CMP|Thank you.|T
0360224|CC|11, Houston. We're handing over COMM to Goldstone. Over. Correction, from Goldstone to Honeysuckle. Over.|T
0360232|CMP|Okay.|T
0360253|CMP|Hello, Houston through Honeysuckle. Ov - -|T
0360300|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.|T
0360305|CMP|You sound good to us through Honeysuckle. How do we sound?|T
0360308|CC|Roger. You're five-by, Mike. We'd like the OMNI configuration as follows. OMNI Alfa placed in Bravo, OMNI to OMNI, high-gain track to MANUAL, high-gain yaw 270, pitch - -|T
0360355|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At the present time we are handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California, to the site at Honeysuckle which accounts for the noise in the transmission -|P
0360402|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.|T
0360407|LMP|Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. I'm not sure I got all those. I've got S-band OMNI B, OMNI, track to MANUAL, and beam wide, pitch - you'd better say that again, and yaw 270. Over.|T
0360426|CC|Roger, Buzz. I broke up at pitch minus 50 at beam wide. Over.|T
0360437|LMP|Roger. Copy.|T
0360525|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy some numbers on status report, et cetera.|T
0360531|CC|Say again. Over.|T
0360538|LMP|Roger. Are you ready to copy some numbers on the status report, et cetera?|T
0360542|CC|Roger. Go ahead. Over.|T
0360549|LMP|Okay. Radiation CDR 11005, CMP 10006, LMP 09007; medication negative. And I got some battery and RCS numbers for you.|T
0360607|CC|Go ahead. Over.|T
0360611|LMP|Battery C 37.1, PYRO battery A and B both 37.1. RCS Alfa 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.|T
0360628|CC|Roger, we copy. Radiation 11005, 10006, 09007; no medication; 37.1, 37.1, 37.1, 82, 84, 85, 87. Over.|T
0360652|LMP|That's affirmative. And you want a LM/CM DELTA-V? It's 1.1.|T
0360657|CC|Roger. Copy 1.1.|T
0360757|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please verify the four CRYO heaters AUTO, the four fans off. Over.|T
0360808|LMP|Okay. We have been holding the O2 heater number 1 in the OFF position. I believe that was your last instruction. All the other heaters are AUTO and all fans are off. Over.|T
0360822|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0360826|CC|11, Houston. We would like all heaters AUTO. Over.|T
0360832|LMP|Roger. All four AUTO, all four fans off.|T
0360900|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. As the Sun sinks slowly in the west, the White Team bids you good night. If we get a story on the seven-tenths, we can give it to you in about 15 minutes or so; if not, we'll give it to you in the morning. Over.|T
0360916|CMP|Okay. That sounds fine, Charlie. Thanks.|T
0360933|LMP|Hey, you earned your pay today, Charlie. Thank you.|T
0360939|CC|Roger. Good night all.|T
0361030|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours 11 minutes. At the present time Apollo 11 is 134,000 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity is 4,216 feet per second. During that last series of transmissions from the crew, we received a status report from Buzz Aldrin and he reported that the crew has, in the past 24 hours, taken no medication. This is similar to the crew status report we received from them last night. We bid them good night at 36 hours 9 minutes or about 2 minutes ago. We anticipate that the crew will probably have a few more housekeeping type chores aboard the spacecraft before they actually turn in and also we'll probably be combining their eat period with the first part of that sleep period. At 36 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control Houston.|P
0362006|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. One request: the optics switch to zero. And we're - got a lot of theories on why it maneuvered at seven-tenths a moment ago, Mike, but no real definite answer. We'll be back with you later. Over.|T
0362022|CMP|Okay. No rush, Charlie. Thank you.|T
0362709|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 27 minutes. We have completed the processing of the unscheduled television transmission which the crew sent down from the spacecraft at about 30 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this evening. I would like to repeat that this was an apparent test of the onboard system. The crew turned the television equipment on and left it on for about 52 minutes. Some of the time we will have a picture of the parts of it, we don't have good lock-on, and I will not have a good solid picture. We should also point out that this transmission was made with the OMNI directional antennas, which, of course, don't provide nearly the signal strength that we would get from the high-gain antenna, which would be used. We'll play back the tape of that transmission for you at this time.|P
0365206|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.|T
0365210|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0365212|CC|Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that 0.7 rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation, the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is, if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.|T
0365308|CMP|Okay. Thank you.|T
0365310|CC|Roger.|T
0372034|PAO|At this time Apollo 11 is 137,219 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4,132 feet per second. Here at Mission Control things have settled down into a rather quiet nighttime routine. We said goodnight to the crew about 36 hours - 36 hours 9 minutes to be exact, a little over a hour ago. We did hear from them once or twice since then and we anticipate that this time are probably getting settled down to begin their 10 hours sleep period. At 37 hours 21 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0382602|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 38 hours 26 minutes. Here in Mission Control, we are presently going through the shift change. Flight Director, Glenn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers are coming on to replace Gene Kranz. The Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be astronaut Ron Evans. Flight Surgeon, John Ziegleschmidt reported that two of the 3 crewmen apparently began sleeping at about 38 hours Ground Elapsed Time or about 26 minutes ago, and the two that are asleep are Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins and Commander, Neil Armstrong. Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin at last report was still awake. We expect the change-of-shift press briefing will occur at about 11:15 Central Daylight Time. At 38 hours 27 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0394004|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 39 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew at this time all three soundly asleep. The space digitals display - stand by. The space digitals display here in Mission Control now showing 82,905 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity 3,897 feet per second relative to the Moon. Awake time 7 hours 19 minutes away. Spacecraft presently over the west-central Pacific, if a line were projected back toward its nearest point on Earth. And at 39 hours 41 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0405804|PAO|This is Apollo control 40 hours 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently 146,300 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 3,917 feet per second. 6 hours, 1 minute remaining in the sleep period - the ten hour sleep period schedule in the Flight Plan. Rather quiet here during the night watch or the Black Team which tonight is being headed up by Flight Director, Jerry Griffin who is spelling the usual Black Team Flight Director, Gene (sic) Lunney. One clock here in Mission Control shows landing time 61 hours 48 minutes from now. This is similar to the entry clock which the - is used in the same position in the Control Room toward the end of a mission, will be refined continuously as we get down to the gnats hair of the exact second of landing. At 40 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.|P
0422800|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 42 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 11 still asleep at this time; some 4 hours 30 minutes remaining in the scheduled 10 hour sleep period. Altitude now, from the Moon 76,529 nautical miles. Velocity from the Moon - or toward the Moon, 3,842 feet per second relative to the Moon, that is.  And, at 42 hours, 28 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0432900|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 43 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently on a spot directly above or directly out from the Malay Peninsula. Some 3 hours 30 minutes remaining in the scheduled 10 hour sleep period for the crew. And if the space digital display were up here at the time coming out of the computer we would know what the distance and velocity were. So, at 43 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0442802|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 44 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 crew has another 2 hours, 31 minutes remaining in their 10 hour sleep period. The spacecraft is now some 72,010 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity continuing to decelerate as we get nearer the changeover point in influence between the Earth and the Moon. Velocity now showing 3,811 feet per second. The spacecraft now calculated to weigh 96,068 pounds. At 44 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0452800|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 45 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A little more than an hour remaining in the Apollo 11 crew sleep period. Present velocity, 3,799 feet per second. Distance from Moon, 69,810 nautical miles. Apollo 11 will continue decelerating as it gets to the point where the Moon's sphere of influence overcomes the Earth's sphere of influence. This point will take place - This event will take place at 61 hours 39 minutes and 57 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, according to the Flight Dynamics Officer. At this point, the spacecraft-to-Moon distance will be 33,822 nautical miles, spacecraft-to-Earth distance, 186,437 nautical miles. The velocity will have slowed to a relative crawl at this point. The Earth referenced 2,990 feet per second, Moon referenced 3,772 feet per second. Clock counting down to lunar touchdown, which as mentioned before, will likely be changed as the spacecraft goes into lunar orbit and the data is refined, some of the times change a few seconds one way or the other. At any rate, the landing clock now showing 57 hours 17 minutes until lunar landing. At 45 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0462800|PAO|This is Apollo control 46 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A little more than a half hour remaining in the crew sleep period. Members of the Green Team of Flight Controllers headed up by prime Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth are coming into the Control Room at this time, and at each console, a handover is taking place from the black watch. At the time - at the present time, the Apollo 11 spacecraft is 67,518 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,787 feet per second. Apollo 11 presently is being tracked by the Madrid S-band station, and at 46 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0465825|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. The Green Team led by Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth has just relieved Glen Lunney's Black Team. The Flight Surgeon, Dr. Willard Hawkins indicates the crew appears to be still asleep. We're nearing the end of the scheduled rest period. Cliff Charlesworth indicates we will put in a call to the crew within a few minutes. Apollo 11 is 158,681 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,578 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 96,068 pounds.|P
0470300|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours, 3 minutes. Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew sleep a little longer. He's just had a conversation with the Flight Surgeon. Dr. Hawkins reports all indications are that the crew is sleeping soundly. The Flight Plan does not warrant awaking them just to get them up. There's no - nothing in the Flight Plan that requires their attention at the present time, so the Flight Director has made a decision to not put in a call to the crew and wake them. Flight surgeon says that a look at the data throughout the night indicates that the crew slept rather well all night.|P
0474127|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours 41 minutes into the mission. From all indications the crew is still asleep. We're 41 minutes past the end of the scheduled 10-hour rest period now. Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth has decided to let the crew remain asleep and not awaken them from the ground. There is no need to awaken them; nothing scheduled in the Flight Plan that requires their attention at this time. Apollo 11 is 160,137 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3,544 feet per second.|P
0480016|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours into the Apollo 11 mission. The spacecraft is 160,760 nautical miles from Earth. The distance from the Moon is 64,115 nautical miles. The Earth referenced velocity is 3,529 feet per second. The rest period has now lasted an hour longer than the 10-hour period scheduled. It is extended to 11 hours now. Flight Surgeon says there ate indications that the commander, Neil Armstrong, may be awakening; some stirring around, however, we have not yet put in a call to the crew. The mid-course correction 3, which was scheduled for this afternoon at an elapsed time of 53 hours, 54 minutes, has been canceled. The velocity value for that mid-course is only eight-tenths of a foot per second, so we will not do mid-course correction number 3. We'll continue to standby for either a call from the ground or a call from the spacecraft.|P
0480900|CC|Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0480900|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours, 9 minutes. We just put in a call to the crew. Here's that conversation.|P
0480908|LMP|Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.|T
0480910|CC|Good morning, Apollo 11.|T
0480919|LMP|... nice sleep. Be getting around to the ...|T
0480934|LMP|How's everything look up here from the ground?|T
0480947|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Roger. Say again, please.|T
0480954|LMP|Roger. How do all our systems look?|T
0480959|CC|Roger. They're looking great, and as far as we can tell everything is good from down here. Over.|T
0481008|LMP|Roger. Looks like the attitude held up real well during PTC last night.|T
0481013|CC|Yes, it did. We were showing you remaining well within a circle of 10 degrees radius throughout the night. Seems to be working beautifully.|T
0481037|CMP|How's the old Green Team this morning? Did you have a quiet night?|T
0481040|CC|Yes. It was a very quiet night. Down here the old Black Team is complaining they didn't get a chance to make any transmissions. Ron Evans is getting -|T
0481053|CMP|Well, we'll be seeing them tomorrow, I guess.|T
0481055|CC|Yes. Ron's getting to be known as the silent Capcom.|T
0481103|CMP|That's the best kind, Bruce.|T
0481105|CC|(Laughter) Okay.|T
0481141|CC|And, when you feel up to copying, 11, I've got a couple of small items in the way of a Flight Plan update and your morning consumables update. Over.|T
0481215|LMP|Apollo 11.|T
0481218|CC|Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a wastewater dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down there at the time for mid-course correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting mid-course correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for mid-course number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn mid-course correction 4, this would then give you a burn for mid-course correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.|T
0481352|LMP|- then we'll get to the wastewater dump - -|T
0481357|CC|Say again, please. You're cutting out.|T
0481404|LMP|Roger. ... - -|T
0481426|CC|11, this is Houston. Stand by a minute, please. We're having difficulty receiving you.|T
0481512|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.|T
0481517|LMP|Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.|T
0481520|CC|Roger. Reading you the same. We did a minor reconfiguration down here. Stand by. Out.|T
0481534|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That first conversation was with Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins joined in. We've not yet heard from Neil Armstrong.|P
0481637|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. We switched your OMNI antennas as you rolled through the appropriate position. Did you copy the Flight Plan update item?|T
0481707|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over|T
0481715|LMP|Apollo 11, go ahead.|T
0481717|CC|Roger, 11. Did you copy the Flight Plan update items? Over.|T
0481723|LMP|Roger. How do you read me now, Bruce?|T
0481725|CC|Loud and clear, now. |T
0481729|LMP|Okay. The battery charge is in the process now and the wastewater dump is in work. MCC 3 has been canceled. It would have been 0.8 feet per second. MCC 4 now looks like about 2.4 feet per second. At around 53 hours we'll do a P52 in PTC. Over.|T
0481756|CC|Roger, 11. The magnitudes of the mid-course corrections were just for your information, but mid-course 4 was down around 2.0 feet per second. Again, for your information, on SPS chamber pressure, it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry, and your value of 89 onboard corresponds to 94. Over.|T
0481854|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Radio check on a new power amplifier in our transmitter. Over.|T
0481902|LMP|Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.|T
0481905|CC|Roger. Loud and clear. Did you copy my notes on SPS chamber pressure?|T
0481912|LMP|Negative.|T
0481913|CC|Okay. Just for your information again, it appears that your readout of 87 psi corresponds to our corrected TM readout of 92 - that's 92 psi, and 89 onboard is really 94 psi. Over.|T
0481949|LMP|Roger, I got that you were reading about 5 psi low.|T
0481953|CC|Roger. And are you ready for the consumables update?|T
0482000|LMP|Ready to copy.|T
0482002|CC|Okay. Consumables update for GET of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus 1 pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the RCS total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. Over.|T
0482054|LMP|Okay. I copy those, and I'll give you our percentages now: Alpha 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.|T
0482107|CC|This is Houston. We copy your percentages, and do you have a crew status report on sleep For us?|T
0482125|LMP|Roger. And in descending order 8, 9, and 8. Over.|T
0482131|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0482201|PAO|That would be Armstrong 8, Collins 9, Aldrin 8.|P
0482254|LMP|Houston, we're getting CRYO pressure warning now in the middle of stirring up the ...|T
0482303|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0482344|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Flight Surgeon reports that is not a record for sleep. The Apollo 10 crew during one rest period logged 10 hours of sleep.|P
0483236|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy-colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.|T
0483358|CC|Roger, 11. We copy your weather description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.|T
0483419|LMP|It looks like it's a shadow. Coming around to ... background noise ...|T
0483433|CC|We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.|T
0483445|LMP|Okay. It's coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you ...|T
0483450|CC|Roger, we're hearing you.|T
0483501|PAO|That's Buzz Aldrin with the description.|P
0483702|CC|11, this is Houston. The noise on the COMM seems to have quieted down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the Earth out of view in your window. Over.|T
0483717|LMP|Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.|T
0483726|CC|Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your wastewater dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the wastewater dump. We're watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.|T
0483814|LMP|Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.|T
0483825|CC|Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the wastewater dump. We don't recall ever having performed a wastewater dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.|T
0483844|LMP|Well, now we know.|T
0483846|CC|Roger.|T
0484254|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I am looking at this - these clouds now around Pakistan through the sextant, and it appears to be one single cell in the latter stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one ...|T
0484537|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.|T
0484556|LMP|Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.|T
0484624|CC|Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.|T
0484638|LMP|Well, I can't see it right now. It's outside the field of view.|T
0484642|CC|Roger.|T
0484643|LMP|And, I don't know you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.|T
0484650|CC|Okay. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.|T
0484700|LMP|Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can trace it all the way on up.|T
0484714|CC|Roger.|T
0484720|LMP|I guess that is down though, isn't it?|T
0484840|CC|Apollo 11, Houston.|T
0484846|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0484848|CC|Roger. We have been working under the assumption that it would take about an hour for the interference from a wastewater dump to dissipate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation condition, now? Over.|T
0484919|CMP|Yes. Stand by one, Bruce.|T
0484921|CC|Okay.|T
0484944|CMP|My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.|T
0485002|CC|Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, there.|T
0485014|CMP|Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.|T

0485636|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few small particles ...|T
0485651|CC|Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?|T
0485702|LMP|Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the wastewater particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.|T
0485723|CC|Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.|T
0485732|LMP|No. I see the reflection from the Sun.|T
0485736|CC|Roger.|T
0485741|CMP|The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.|T

0494124|LMP|Roger. Roger. You're coming back a little scratchy. It,looks like our O2 flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. I just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. Over.|T
0494145|CC|Roger.|T
0494241|CC|11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning in this fashion. It's probably just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.|T

0535500|CMP|Start after the rains in Houston.|T
0535503|CC|Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.|T
0535639|CC|In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early pre-season workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies.

0535830|CC|Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?|T
0535840|CMP|Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.|T
0535914|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0535923|CMP|Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bag we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.|T

0543432|CDR|Hello, Houston. Go ahead.|T
0543434|CC|Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the wastewater dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high-gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.|T
0543519|CDR|Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.|T
0543530|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0543535|LMP|When you work up an attitude to get high-gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?|T
0543546|CC|This is Houston. We'll have a look at it.|T
0543554|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong confirming they will attempt TV at approximately an elapsed time of 56 hours 20 minutes and then the last of the question was by Buzz Aldrin.|P
0543915|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0543921|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0543923|CC|Roger. We have a TV attitude for you if you're ready to copy.|T
0543933|CMP|Go ahead. Ready to copy.|T
0543935|CC|Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54:45:00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the Command Module and places the high-gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.|T
0544037|CMP|Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.|T
0544042|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0544254|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. When we pass the proper roll angle, we're not going to be anywhere near zero degrees yaw. Do you want us to just stop at the yaw angle we find ourselves in  and then VERB 49 the three angles you gave us?|T

0545610|CMP|Stand by, Charlie.|T
0545619|CMP|Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now, I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O2 valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O2 flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?|T
0545648|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0545653|CC|EECOMM's say they'd like to look at valve positions. Over.|T
0545701|CMP|Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 5.4; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.|T
0545719|CC|Roger.|T
0545730|CMP|It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.|T

0551018|CC|Roger.|T
0551026|PAO|That was Capcom, Charlie Duke, advising the crew that we are not quite prepared for television reception at this time. You heard Mike Collins respond that this one's for free. We still intend to get the television transmission during the time the crew is in the Lunar Module, beginning about 56 hours 20 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, which would be about 4:52pm Central Daylight Time.|P
0551120|PAO|We are getting a black and white television picture in the Control Center at this time and we should have that in color by now. Interior view of the Command Module looking up into the LM hatch, CSM land hatch area. We can't quite make out which crewman we're seeing up in the tunnel working with the probe and drogue assembly.|P
0551425|PAO|Getting a very good view of the work going on in the Command and Service Module tunnel. It appears to be Neil Armstrong working in the tunnel. Operating - working on the drogue and probe assembly.|P
0551502|PAO|This extremely sharp clear picture is coming to us from about a 175,000 miles distance from Earth. Presently about 48,000 miles from the Moon.|P
0551646|PAO|And, that appears as if it might be all the "free" TV, as Mike Collins put it. Not forgetting, we do expect to get the television transmission from the time the crew is in the Lunar Module and that period of activity is scheduled to begin in about 56 hours 20 minutes with the ingress to the Lunar Module. And we are starting to get a picture back again; losing lock momentarily and now we had it back again. Neil Armstrong up in the tunnel at this point, removing the probe and drogue assembly in preparation for the ingress to the Lunar Module.|P
0551800|PAO|Our network controller just reported that this television is coming to us on the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California.|P
0551935|PAO|We just saw the probe assembly start to come loose now as Neil Armstrong is -|P
0551949|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.|T
0551956|LMP|Yes, it's loose now.|T
0551958|CDR|Can you see that?|T
0551959|CC|Roger, Neil. It's really good.|T
0552004|CDR|Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.|T
0552011|CC|There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.|T
0552023|CDR|I think those are the tunnel lights.|T
0552024|SC|...|T
0552025|CC|Oh, Okay. You're right.|T
0552033|LMP|Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.|T
0552036|CC|Roger.|T
0552059|CC|Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.|T
0552105|CDR|You bet. This is the only way ...|T
0552106|LMP|You have to take it easy. It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.|T
0552112|CC|11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.|T
0552128|CDR|Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.|T
0552134|CC|Roger.|T
0552140|CC|We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.|T
0552201|CC|11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.|T
0552213|CDR|Roger.|T
0552216|CC|We can see the probe now. Correction, the drogue.|T
0552223|CDR|Roger.|T
0552305|CMP|Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.|T
0552308|CC|Roger. As we suspected.|T
0552330|PAO|Once removal of the drogue is completed, they will have access to the LM hatch and be able to go into the tunnel.|P
0552408|CC|11, Houston. Now it's a good view of the storage area under the couch.|T
0552436|CC|11, Houston. Looks like you're pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.|T
0552444|CDR|Oh, it's not really bad.|T
0552445|LMP|This TV cable is getting in the way.|T
0552455|CC|We see lots of arms.|T
0552522|CMP|The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.|T
0552529|CC|Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.|T
0552613|PAO|This unscheduled television transmission has now run about 18 minutes, and we have no estimate at this point as to how long it will continue. Mike Collins reported that it would - we would go ahead with the regularly scheduled one when they are in the LM.|P
0552630|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.|T
0552640|LMP|Roger. We do.|T
0552643|CC|Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.|T
0552658|LMP|Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?|T
0552702|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0552735|PAO|Have a good view here of the computer display and keyboard assembly with the green lights flashing.|P
0552743|CMP|We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.|T
0552750|CC|Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.|T
0552756|CMP|And that's a plus.|T
0552758|CC|Roger. Plus.|T
0552830|PAO|The reference to the roll CAL, or roll calibration index marker in the tunnel, which shows how far off exact 0 the 2 vehicles were when the docking occurred.|P
0552847|CC|11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.|T
0552856|CDR|It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.|T
0552901|CC|Roger.|T
0552909|CC|11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.|T
0552924|LMP|I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.|T
0552931|CC|Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.|T
0553006|CMP|Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.|T
0553013|CC|That sounds fine to us. Over.|T
0553017|PAO|Mike Collins reporting there on the appearance of the latches.|P
0553046|CC|11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.|T
0553055|LMP|Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.|T
0553058|CC|Okay.|T
0553113|CC|We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.|T
0553136|LMP|Hey, you get an A-plus.|T
0553138|CC|Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.|T
0553147|CMP|I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.|T
0553155|CC|Roger.|T
0553239|PAO|An interested observer of these amazingly clear pictures coming to us from more than 175,000 miles out in space is Astronaut, Gene Cernan, who got a first hand view of some of this same area of the spacecraft during his Apollo 10 flight.|P
0553307|CC|That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. Over.|T
0553316|CDR|Roger.|T
0553325|CDR|Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there.|T
0553334|CC|Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.|T
0553357|CC|11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.|T
0553414|LMP|Roger. Thank you.|T
0553524|CMP|Okay, the dump valve is actuated.|T
0553527|CC|Roger. Copy, 11. We see that very clearly. Is that you, Buzz, with your hand on it?|T
0553533|CMP|Yes.|T
0553534|LMP|Roger.|T
0553611|CC|11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.|T
0553619|CMP|It is, considering the amount of light up in there.|T
0553620|CDR|Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.|T
0553622|CC|Roger.|T
0553633|LMP|- that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.|T
0553639|CC|How about that. Just like the refrigerator.|T
0553649|PAO|That conversation between Charlie Duke and Mike Collins referring to the automatic light that comes on in the LM when the hatch is opened.|P
0553708|CC|Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.|T
0553728|CC|Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -|T
0553729|CDR|(Laugher) We don't see anything loose up there.|T
0553731|CC|Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.|T
0553754|CC|And, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.|T
0553836|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.|T
0553843|LMP|Roger. I'm halfway in, I'm going to start turning around, I guess.|T
0553847|CC|Roger.|T
0553849|PAO|Buzz Aldrin, reporting that he's halfway into the LM. His view is inside the LM cabin.|P
0553915|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.|T
0553927|LMP|Okay. Stand by.|T
0553950|CC|11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.|T
0554001|LMP|Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.|T
0554006|CC|That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.|T
0554015|LMP|Well, that may be good in some respects.|T
0554023|CC|We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...|T
0554032|LMP|Now let me show you a view looking the other way.|T
0554034|CC|Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.|T
0554045|CC|I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.|T
0554114|CC|We see you waving.|T
0554121|PAO|Buzz Aldrin has apparently carried the camera into the LM with him, showing us Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins back in the CSM.|P
0554133|CC|11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.|T
0554147|CC|11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.|T
0554156|CMP|Just saying hello.|T
0554158|LMP|On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.|T
0554219|CC|Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.|T
0554229|LMP|It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?|T
0554235|CC|Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.|T
0554243|LMP|Okay.|T
0554247|CC|We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.|T
0554259|LMP|I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.|T
0554325|CC|11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.|T
0554336|CC|The light is superb.|T
0554337|LMP|How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?|T
0554345|CC|It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.|T
0554409|LMP|Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.|T
0554417|CC|Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.|T
0554430|CDR|Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely day-lit; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.|T
0554444|CC|Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.|T
0554456|PAO|This ingress to the Lunar Module came about 40 minutes ahead of the Flight Plan, and we would presume that the unscheduled TV is perhaps merging with the schedule a little bit early.|P
0554506|CDR|Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.|T
0554512|CC|Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.|T
0554519|LMP|...|T
0554544|CC|11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.|T
0554559|LMP|Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.|T
0554613|CC|Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.|T
0554619|CC|11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.|T
0554659|LMP|The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.|T
0554705|CC|Roger.|T
0554717|CC|11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.|T
0554724|LMP|Now you know how we feel.|T
0554731|LMP|Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.|T
0554736|CC|Copy.|T
0554737|LMP|And mine's about 5800, also.|T
0554740|CC|Copy.|T
0554753|PAO|Aldrin's hand resting on one of the portable life support systems which will be used on the Moons surface.|P
0554806|CC|11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.|T
0554816|LMP|No, that's mine.|T
0554841|CC|11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. And, now behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.|T
0554858|PAO|We're not quite sure who's holding the camera at this point. Apparently it's drifting freely inside the cabin.|P
0554913|PAO|Or more likely attached to some convenient point within the LM cabin.|P
0555003|LMP|We're going to go ahead and take all the loop data on back into the Command Module, Charlie.|T
0555008|CC|Roger.|T
0555048|PAO|This television transmission has now been running about 42 minutes, and the spacecraft now about 176,000 miles from Earth.|P
0555059|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're attempting to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.|T
0555110|LMP|Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.|T
0555118|CC|Roger.|T
0555216|LMP|We got a beautiful view of the side of the Command Module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.|T
0555224|CC|Roger.|T
0555225|LMP|I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the Command Module.|T
0555241|LMP|I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.|T
0555256|CC|Roger. Great shot now back down into the -|T
0555304|CMP|And left on the - -|T
0555306|CC|Go ahead, Buzz. Over.|T
0555308|LMP|Say again.|T
0555309|CC|I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the Command Module.|T
0555310|LMP|...|T
0555315|LMP|Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.|T
0555326|CC|Roger.|T
0555333|PAO|Neil Armstrong has apparently been holding the camera, looking back down through the tunnel it appears now that he's handed the camera to Buzz Aldrin. As he is still looking back through the tunnel we see Mike Collins in the background there.|P
0555409|LMP|Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?|T
0555415|CC|Stand by.|T
0555418|LMP|We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.|T
0555424|CC|Roger.|T
0555431|LMP|We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the Command Module here and get a little circulation going.|T
0555437|CC|Sounds like a good idea. Over.|T
0555505|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.|T
0555518|LMP|That we will do.|T
0555554|LMP|Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the Command Module right-hand rendezvous window.|T
0555602|CC|Roger.|T
0555620|CC|Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.|T
0555633|LMP|One washer on -|T
0555639|LMP|One washer's on by the overhead.|T
0555643|CC|Roger.|T
0555650|CC|There we go. We got it now.|T
0555659|CDR|There wasn't very much debris in the Command Module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.|T
0555715|CC|Roger. Sounds good.|T
0555746|CC|11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.|T
0555904|LMP|Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?|T
0555912|CC|11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.|T
0555923|CDR|You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.|T
0555939|CC|11, Houston. We had a - -|T
0555940|LMP|... on my monitor.|T
0555942|CC|We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.|T
0555949|LMP|Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.|T
0555956|CC|Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.|T
0560029|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.|T
0560042|LMP|Roger. Will do.|T
0560145|PAO|This transmission has been running about 54 minutes at this point.|P
0560158|CC|11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.|T
0560215|CC|We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.|T
0560225|CC|We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PC O2. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.|T
0560258|CC|11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.|T
0560328|CC|We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.|T
0560335|LMP|Yes. We're going to tape that one over.|T
0560336|CC|Roger.|T
0560337|LMP|We're going to tape that one over.|T
0560338|CC|We concur.|T
0560345|LMP|The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.|T
0560354|CC|Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.|T
0560417|CC|11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.|T
0560431|CC|You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.|T
0560455|LMP|Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the Flight Plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.|T
0560455|PAO|At this point, we have had to take the color down momentarily. We've run out of tape in the color conversion recorder. We estimate we'll have the black and white for about 5 minutes while the tape changes in process and then continue to convert in color after that point.|P
0560519|CC|Stand by, Buzz.|T
0560523|LMP|As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.|T
0560533|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.|T
0560547|CC|11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -|T
0560606|LMP|We understood that, Charlie.|T
0560609|CC|Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.|T
0560620|LMP|Okay. That's what we'll do.|T
0560704|PAO|The black and white view that you're seeing now is the unconverted color picture as it comes down from the spacecraft. The flicker, of course, is taken out in the conversion process. We've now been receiving television pictures from the spacecraft for about 1 hour.|P
0560717|LMP|Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.|T
0560735|CC|Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.|T
0560746|LMP|It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.|T
0560757|CC|11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.|T
0560811|LMP|Oh, very well. Thank you.|T
0560816|PAO|The reference to the friendly geologist refers to Astronaut, Jack Schmitt who is here in the Control Center.|P
0560829|LMP|There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.|T
0560836|CC|Roger.|T
0560846|PAO|And, we're back with the color.|P
0560911|CC|The shades couldn't quite hack it, there, Buzz. Over.|T
0560952|CMP|Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?|T
0560957|CC|Stand by, Mike.|T
0561008|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.|T
0561018|CMP|Okay. Thank you.|T
0561020|CC|You're welcome.|T
0561125|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.|T
0561135|CDR|It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.|T
0561229|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.|T
0561244|LMP|Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.|T
0561248|CC|What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.|T
0561258|LMP|Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.|T
0561303|CC|Roger.|T
0561307|CDR|It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but the comfort level is about the - about the same as the Command Module.|T
0561321|CC|You probably - -|T
0561321|CDR|It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.|T
0561328|CC|Houston copies. Out.|T
0561428|CC|11, Houston.|T
0561429|LMP|You may be able to see some - -|T
0561432|CC|Go ahead.|T
0561433|LMP|- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.|T
0561442|CC|Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.|T
0561551|LMP|I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from this position on the right-hand window.|T
0561600|CC|Roger.|T
0561615|CC|11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.|T
0561632|CDR|No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stops, I think.|T
0561643|CC|I think that's right.|T
0561651|LMP|Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.|T
0561658|CC|Roger.|T
0561706|CC|11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.|T
0561718|LMP|Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.|T
0561742|CC|11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.|T
0561758|LMP|Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.|T
0561809|CC|Roger.|T
0561817|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.|T
0561832|CC|And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.|T
0561842|LMP|I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.|T
0561850|CC|Roger.|T
0562006|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?|T
0562014|LMP|It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.|T
0562029|CC|Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.|T
0562031|LMP|Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.|T
0562103|CC|Buzz, we see you putting your window guard in place there, and back up to the ISA now.|T
0562202|CDR|Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.|T
0562209|CC|Stand by.|T
0562338|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? Over.|T
0562346|CDR|Yes, he is looking for it now.|T
0562347|CC|Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.|T
0562429|CDR|Our monitor shows a pretty good, clear picture from this angle. And, we've found the 90-degree bracket.|T
0562438|CC|Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, a good picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see - your handles, and now over to the bracket.|T
0562526|LMP|That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.|T
0562541|CC|Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.|T
0562603|CDR|Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.|T
0562612|CC|11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.|T
0562620|CDR|Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?|T
0562623|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0562627|CDR|Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.|T
0562639|CC|Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.|T
0562737|PAO|We've been receiving television now from the spacecraft for about an hour and 20 minutes. Apollo 11 presently 177,000 miles from Earth.|P
0562750|CC|What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?|T
0562756|CDR|That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.|T
0562803|CC|Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.|T
0562818|CC|Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.|T
0562826|LMP|Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that we've laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.|T
0562914|CC|Roger.|T
0562918|LMP|And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.|T
0562922|CC|Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.|T
0563025|CC|11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.|T
0563048|CC|11, that's real good camera work.|T
0563107|CDR|That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.|T
0563117|CC|Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.|T
0563142|LMP|We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.|T
0563205|CC|Roger.|T
0563211|LMP|Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'll not take those out now.|T
0563228|CC|Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.|T
0563241|LMP|Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?|T
0563245|CC|Standby. I think so.|T
0563259|CC|11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, Western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.|T
0563316|LMP|Roger. Understand. Thank you.|T
0563349|CC|Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Appreciate it.|T
0563439|CC|Well, that's a good view of Mr. Collins down there. We finally see him again.|T
0563447|CMP|Hello there, earthlings.|T
0563452|CC|Hello there.|T
0563523|CC|11, Houston. We noticed when you were scanning over Panel 2 a moment ago, 1 and 2, the two eight balls were slightly in disagreement. Control said he'd like a AGS align, there.|T
0563540|LMP|Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGS.|T
0563545|CDR|The problem is, we don't know whether to align AGS to PNGS or PNGS to AGS.|T
0563552|CC|Stand by.|T
0563558|CC|11, Chris said he can tell you.|T
0563606|LMP|We'll cage them both.|T
0563609|CC|Roger.|T
0563702|LMP|Like old home week, Charlie, to get back in the LM again.|T
0563705|CC|Roger. I can imagine.|T
0563725|LMP|The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the Command Module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.|T
0563745|CC|Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?|T
0563757|CDR|We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.|T
0563802|CC|Roger. I'd advise him to keep his hands off the switches.|T
0563809|CMP|If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.|T
0563814|CC|Roger.|T
0563819|LMP|That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do. He won't let me touch it any more.|T
0563824|CC|Roger.|T
0563844|PAO|It appears now that we have a view of Earth out the window.|P
0563855|CC|11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.|T
0563901|CDR|That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.|T
0563919|PAO|That description from Neil Armstrong.|P
0563934|CDR|We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?|T
0563942|CC|Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.|T
0564000|CDR|Roger. We have that in our monitor also.|T
0564021|CC|11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.|T
0564036|LMP|No, those are the same three ones that we have.|T
0564039|CC|Okay.|T
0564048|LMP|How far are - out are we now, Charlie?|T
0564052|CC|Stand by. Give you exact figure.|T
0564101|LMP|Did you notice the difference between yesterday and today? This is as large an image we can - we can give you.|T
0564106|CC|Roger. If you think we're smaller, you're now 177,000 miles out. Over.|T
0564114|LMP|Thank you.|T
0564115|CDR|That's nautical miles?|T
0564118|CC|That's affirmative, 11. We -|T
0564122|LMP|... Hold on.|T
0564125|CC|Go ahead. Over.|T
0564135|CC|11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intra-tropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.|T
0564152|CMP|Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.|T
0564155|CC|Roger.|T
0564206|CMP|Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day, is all we ask.|T
0564231|CDR|And Charlie, I'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes.|T
0564248|CC|Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, certainly appreciate that.|T
0564332|CC|11, Houston. We have you - your sub-spacecraft point is just off the western coast of South America directly south of about Mexico City. Over.|T
0564347|CDR|That - That looks like what we observe from here.|T
0564402|CDR|And we're going to turn our TV monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. Apollo 11 signing off.|T
0564413|CC|Roger, 11. Thank you very much. That was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. We sure appreciate it. Over.|T
0564421|CDR|It was a pleasure.|T
0564455|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That television transmission lasted about 1 hour 36 minutes according to our first rough calculation. And during that period of time, the spacecraft traveled something over 2000 nautical miles.|P
0564551|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.|T
0564602|CDR|We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.|T
0564623|CC|Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.|T
0564636|CDR|Okay. We'd like to get a Flight Plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.|T
0564654|CC|Roger. Stand by. We'll have that to you in a moment.|T
0565055|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 56 hours 51 minutes. Buzz Aldrin has now been in the Lunar Module for a little over an hour and 13 minutes. We estimate that Neil Armstrong has perhaps been in the LM about 15 or 20 minutes less than that. Due to the length of that television transmission, the change-of-shift press conference has been canceled. The participants were unable to wait for the duration of the press conference and with other duties and the press conference has been canceled. At 56 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0565609|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a wastewater dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.|T
0565622|LMP|Roger. We copy that, Charlie.|T
0565632|CDR|How does that work, Charlie?|T
0565727|CDR|Houston, 11.|T
0565804|CC|11, Houston. Did you call? Over.|T
0565809|CDR|Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.|T
0565824|CC|Roger.|T
0565825|CDR|The EVA light still does work.|T
0565828|CC|Roger. We'll let this - the SPAN guys look at this, and we'll be back with you with what we think. Over.|T
0565837|CDR|Okay.|T
0570021|CC|11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.|T
0570036|CDR|Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.|T
0570052|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0570125|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.|T
0570145|CDR|Roger. PTC at 58 hours.|T
0570149|CC|And we'll have the remaining functions in the Flight Plan soon. Over.|T
0570156|CDR|Okay. Fine.|T
0570255|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 3 minutes. The decision, as you heard, relayed up to the crew there, that we would go into the Passive Thermal Control mode with the spacecraft in a slow roll at 58 hours in the Flight Plan, would rule out further television for today. I would also like to repeat that the change-of-shift press conference for the previous shift was canceled due to the length of that television transmission, and we do expect to have a change-of-shift briefing following this shift probably between 11:30 and 12:00pm CDT. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 178,236 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity has dropped down now to 3,146 feet per second. At 57 hours, 4 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.|P
0570405|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as Flight Plan goes, are: Continue your LM familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the CSM, close the hatch, and establish PTC shortly thereafter. Over.|T
0570427|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. Terminate the - -|T
0570429|CDR|Okay - -|T
0570430|CC|- - the water dump. Over.|T
0570431|CDR|- - Okay, Charlie. Thank you.|T
0570435|CDR|Okay. Water dump being terminated now.|T
0571749|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0571751|CC|11, Houston. Go ahead.|T
0571756|CMP|Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.|T
0571803|CC|Roger, 11. Stand by.|T
0571814|CC|11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.|T
0571820|CMP|Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?|T
0571829|CC|11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some information on the apparent drift rates.|T
0571841|CMP|Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the maroons on?|T
0571848|CC|Say again, 11.|T
0571852|CMP|I say you got the maroons on now?|T
0571854|CC|Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The maroon team will be on tomorrow.|T
0571907|CMP|Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?|T
0571910|CC|Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.|T
0571916|CMP|Okay.|T
0571928|CC|11, Houston. We suggest you go ahead and do the P52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. Over.|T
0571938|CMP|All right. Fair enough.|T
0572501|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0572506|CDR|Go ahead. 11, here.|T
0572508|CC|11, Houston. A little information to you there, CDR. We've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - I understand it's been sent to us directly from Wapakoneta, your own hometown. Over.|T
0572529|LMP|No, we can't - we can't pronounce it either.|T
0572533|CDR|I think you'll enjoy that. They make a fine brand of cheese.|T
0572538|CC|Roger, there, and I'll polish up the grammar for the next trip.|T
0572551|CMP|Houston, 11. You are looking at the NOUN 93, and I'll proceed when you copy them.|T
0572601|CC|11, Houston. We've got them.|T
0572609|CMP|Okay.|T
0572816|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT. We have a DELTA-H update for you. Over.|T
0572825|CMP|All right, Charlie. Stand by one.|T
0572931|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. P00 and ACCEPT.|T
0572934|CC|Roger.|T
0573149|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. The computer's yours. Over.|T
0573158|CMP|Houston, 11. Roger.|T
0573615|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like for you to stir up the CRYO's now. Over.|T
0573615|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Roger.|T
0574422|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 44 minutes. We've had no further reports from the crew to indicate whether or not Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have returned to the Command Module.|P
0574433|CDR|Houston, Apollo 11. We're completed in the LM. We're closing up the hatches and the probe and drogue back in.|T
0574452|CC|Roger. We copy. Out.|T
0574454|PAO|And I guess that would answer our question. Neil Armstrong reporting that they are finished with their work in the LM, will be coming out shortly. Apollo 11 is now 179,490 nautical miles from Earth. Traveling at a speed of 3,121 feet per second. In a little less than 3 hours, we'll pass a milestone of sorts, as the spacecraft passes into the lunar sphere of influence. And what we mean by that, is that at that point, the spacecraft will be under the dominant influence of the Moon's gravity. The Moon's gravitational force will have the predominant effect on the trajectory of the spacecraft. And at that point, our displays in Mission Control monitoring velocity and altitude will switch from Earth reference to Moon reference. We'll then begin monitoring the progress of the spacecraft as it continues to accelerate toward the Moon. At 57 hours 46 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0575939|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by to watch your startup on the PTC at any time. You can start off at the VERB 49. Over.|T
0575950|CDR|Wilco. We're just finishing up the probe and about to close up the hatch here. We're going to be a couple of minutes late, probably, getting started in the PTC.|T
0580000|CC|Roger. No sweat, 11. We're standing by. Over.|T
0580016|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That was Neil Armstrong reporting that they are now reinstalling the probe and drogue, which is just about on the Flight Plan schedule, and they reported that they would be putting the spacecraft in a slow roll shortly to maintain Passive Thermal Control. In that mode the spacecraft rotates at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain even heating. We have a precise time on that sphere of influence change, the point of which the Moon - for calculation purposes here. Mission Control, comes under the predominate influence - the spacecraft comes under the predominate influence of the Moon's gravitational field, and we now calculate that that will occur at 61 hours, 39 minutes, 55 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time.|P
0580609|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, there's no wait required. Where rates are steady, you can proceed on. Over. |T
0580617|CDR|I'm doing it, Charlie.|T
0580618|CC|Roger.|T
0580625|CMP|The tunnel's all taken care of, the drogue, probe, and hatch all back in.|T
0580629|CC|Roger. Copy. Out.|T
0581002|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some new additions to your alternate contingency checklist if you would break that out. Over.|T
0581015|CDR|Stand by.|T
0581147|CDR|Okay, Houston. 11's ready to copy.|T
0581149|CC|Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F/2-22. Over|T
0581229|CDR|Okay. I have F/2-22.|T
0581232|CC|Roger, Neil. Under column L - that's column Lima, line 06. The new data is 00001. Line 07, the new data is 02134. Over.|T
0581303|CDR|Okay. I have in F2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134.|T
0581321|CC|Roger. That's correct. Thank you much. Out.|T
0581338|CC|11, Houston. For your information, those two entries are an update to your DELTA-H that we have already uplinked into the CMC. Over.|T
0581348|CDR|Roger. Thank you.|T
0581405|CMP|What was I marking on, Charlie? About an 18-kilometer line, or what?|T
0581410|CC|We - Our update puts you to - the DELTA-H to 35 kilometers, Mike. Over.|T
0581418|CMP|Okay.|T
0581925|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got some switch positions for you for the high-gain. Over.|T
0581935|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.|T
0581936|CC|Roger, Buzz. Select Bravo, OMNI, HIGH-GAIN TRACK to MANUAL; BEAM, WIDE. Over.|T
0581950|LMP|Okay. Bravo, OMNI; TRACK, MANUAL; and BEAM, WIDE.|T
0581954|CC|Roger. And your high-gain angles are minus 50 on the pitch, 270 on the yaw. Over.|T
0582004|LMP|Okay. Going there now.|T
0584123|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient anytime for you, we're ready with some updates. Over.|T
0584147|CDR|What - What are the updates going to apply to?|T
0584152|CC|Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.|T
0584237|CDR|Okay. Is any of those in the Flight Plan? The secondary radiator, for example?|T
0584244|CC|That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the Flight Plan at 71:20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2-9, L/2-9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.|T
0584309|CDR|Okay. Stand by.|T
0584326|CMP|Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the Flight Plan and not fool around with the checklist.|T
0584333|CC|Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.|T
0584338|CMP|Ready to copy on the leak check.|T
0584341|CC|Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?|T
0584422|CMP|Yes, I'm with you.|T
0584423|CC|Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.|T
0584553|CMP|Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?|T
0584629|CC|Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.|T
0584649|CMP|Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?|T
0584653|CC|Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.|T
0584703|CMP|Okay. Fine.|T
0584733|CDR|Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?|T
0584739|CC|Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.|T
0590851|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. Apollo 11 now 182,000 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity down to 3,072 feet per second. We've had very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the Flight Plan calls for the crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the Flight Plan to pass along. The television transmission which had been scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to 100 hours, 50 minutes in the Flight Plan has been deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission from the Flight Plan was made due to a lack of available satellite channels to relay the signal from the tracking site of Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape, the music of course is erased, and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft.|P
0591058|CC|11, Houston. We're wondering who's on horns.|T
0591110|CDR|Say again, Houston?|T
0591113|CC|We just had a little music there.|T
0591122|CDR|We'll keep you entertained.|T
0591129|CC|Roger. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11.|T
0591137|CDR|Okay.|T
0591235|CMP|Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.|T
0591243|CC|Roger. Happy anniversary.|T
0591252|CMP|Thank you, sir. (music)|T
0591456|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That comment a moment ago about the tenth anniversary of - about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along with John Young, flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18 through July 21, 1966. The brief bit of music that we got from the spacecraft was coming to us from a distance of 182,190 nautical miles.|P
0591933|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.|T
0591936|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
0591952|CC|Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.|T
0592039|LMP|I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.|T
0592047|CC|Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.|T
0592117|LMP|Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.|T
0592136|CC|Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.|T
0592211|LMP|Stand by.|T
0592306|LMP|Okay. I got it.|T
0592308|CC|Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.|T
0592330|LMP|Okay. That's greater than 120 for less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.|T
0592337|CC|That's affirmative. Out.|T
0592347|CC|And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.|T
0592433|LMP|Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.|T
0592436|CC|Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.|T
0592522|LMP|Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.|T
0592530|CC|That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.|T
0592557|LMP|Roger. Got it.|T
0592559|CC|Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.|T
0592640|LMP|Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".|T
0592643|CC|That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ... Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.|T
0593222|CDR|This is Apollo 11. Radio check.|T
0593224|CC|Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.|T
0593228|CDR|Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.|T
0593238|CC|Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.|T
0593301|CDR|Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.|T
0593315|CC|Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?|T
0593331|CDR|Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.|T
0593339|CC|Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.|T
0593345|CDR|Okay.|T
0593434|CC|11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.|T
0593514|CDR|Roger. I think I understand.|T
0593518|CC|Roger.|T
0593546|LMP|Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?|T
0593551|CC|Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.|T
0593556|LMP|Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.|T
0593601|CC|Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.|T
0593613|LMP|Roger. You were cut out that time.|T
0593616|CC|Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over.|T
0593638|CC|11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?|T
0593711|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.|T
0593729|LMP|Apollo 11, understand.|T
0594532|CDR|Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you.|T
0594535|CC|Roger. Go ahead, 11.|T
0594540|CDR|Okay. Radiation: CDR 11009, CMP 10010, LMP 09011. No medication.|T
0594557|CC|Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations. And, we're considering - this PTC looks sort of weird to us, so we're considering stopping and starting over again, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over.|T
0594616|CDR|Okay.|T
0594748|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.|T
0594847|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.|T
0594945|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.|T
0594950|CMP|Go ahead. 11 here.|T
0594952|CC|Roger. We switched antennas on you, there, moments ago, Neil. Could you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.|T
0595001|CMP|It's less than 0.1.|T
0595004|CC|Roger.|T
0595014|CMP|0.15, now, Neil says, Charlie.|T
0595017|CC|Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before. We were wondering if you have had any events or any idea that could help us out. Over.|T
0595037|CMP|I didn't understand that. Say again.|T
0595039|CC|Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over.|T
0595110|CMP|Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything.|T
0595113|CC|Roger.|T
0595114|CMP|Unless it's got something to do with that entry from ... from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.|T
0595122|CC|Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.|T
0595140|CMP|Okay.|T
0595513|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. Over.|T
0595543|CMP|Roger.|T
0595711|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours 57 minutes. A few moments ago you heard Capcom, Charlie Duke advise the crew to terminate the Passive Thermal Control mode that they are presently in and reestablish the three revolution per hour roll rate about the spacecraft longitudinal axis that is used for thermal control. We had noticed a unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode, ideally, it would roll about the longitudinal axis with very little wobble and if wobble is introduced for one reason or another, the Reaction Control System jets would come on as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had occurred and gone beyond prescribed limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct. The jet firings on past missions do tend to disturb the crews sleep. Rather than have the Reaction Control System jets come on during the night and perhaps have to awaken the crew to reestablish the Passive Thermal Control at that time we elected to correct it now.|P
0595839|CC|11, Houston. We recommend you disable Bravo and Charlie; select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.|T
0595927|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0600042|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're getting quite a bit of noise on the air to ground circuit at this time as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna around to the next, and we momentarily lose lock-on. At this time, Apollo 11 is 183,544 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity, holding fairly constant now, at about 3,042 feet per second. It's been moving down towards 3000 feet per second and seems to be leveling off somewhat.|P
0600225|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're going to take the air to ground circuit down temporarily until a stronger antenna lock is - . Here's a call to the crew. We'll stand by for that.|P
0600232|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0600305|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We will take down the air to ground circuit down at this time until we reestablish sufficient signal strength to eliminate the noise on the circuit.|P

0600956|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 10 minutes. We've reestablished good antenna lock-on at this time, and we'll continue to monitor for any conversation from the spacecraft. The crew is presently reestablishing the Passive Thermal Control rotation rate of 3 revolutions per hour. Following that, we expect they will begin their rest period. At the present time Apollo 11 is 183,821 nautical miles from Earth at a velocity 3,037 feet per second.|P

0602517|CMP|Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for everything.|T
0603649|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 37 minutes. We said goodbye - goodnight to the crew about 10 minutes ago. We expect that they will be settling down their rest period shortly. And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest in a comment made by Neil Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a contingency EVA. It would have no function in a normal mission such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the Command and Service Module, the light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would - repeat, that it'd have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that we get and play those back. The Passive Thermal Control mode, which was reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally. At 100 - rather at 60 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0605011|CC|Stand by.|T
0605032|CC|11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.|T
0605039|CMP|Hey, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?|T
0605043|CC|We have absolutely no idea. Over.|T
0605049|CMP|Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?|T
0605057|CC|That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it post-flight, it's got - it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.|T
0605139|CMP|Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.|T
0613919|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 61 hours, 39 minutes. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last report. Flight Surgeon says there is no indication at this time that they have begun to sleep, but we expect they'll be getting to sleep here shortly. Coming up in less than 10 seconds now, we'll be crossing into the sphere of influence of the Moon. A computational changeover will be made here in Mission Control. At this point as the Moon's gravitational force becomes the dominant effect on the spacecraft trajectory, and our displays will shift from Earth reference to Moon reference. At that point, which occurred a few seconds ago, the spacecraft was at a distance of 186,437 nautical miles from Earth, and 33,822 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity with respect to the Earth was 2,990 feet per second, and with respect to the Moon, about 3,272 feet per second. The Passive Thermal Control mode that was set up for the second time by the crew appears to be holding well at this point, and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally, the mission going very smoothly. At 61 hours, 41 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0622905|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 62 hours 29 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that the crew appears to have been asleep now for about the past 30 minutes. The spacecraft appears, also, to be holding its Passive Thermal Control attitude very well. And, at this time Apollo 11 is about 32,000 miles from the Moon traveling at a speed of 3,782 feet per second. In the past 50 minutes or so, we have seen that velocity increase about 10 feet per second going from 3,772 feet per second to the present 3,782 as the spacecraft continues to accelerate toward the Moon. The change-of-shift briefing following this shift will occur at about 11:15pm Central Daylight Time. Flight Director, Glynn Lunney and his team of Flight Controllers are coming on now - being debriefed by the Eugene Kranz team and that shift change will be occurring shortly here. The new Capsule Communicator will be Astronaut, Ron Evans. At 62 hours 30 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
0632902|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 63 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 5 1/2 hours remaining in the Apollo 11 crew scheduled rest period. The crew apparently soundly asleep at this time. Spacecraft now 29,716 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity now 3,796 feet per second. Black Team Flight Director, Glynn Lunney going around the room discussing with the various flight control positions the situation for the sleep shift. Talking now to flight dynamics officer on the pros and cons of doing or not doing mid-course correction burn number 4. And at 63 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0642801|PAO|This is Apollo control 64 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 4 1/2 hours remaining now in the scheduled Apollo 11 crew sleep period. However, since there is little likelihood that mid-course correction burn number 4 will be done, since it's a very small magnitude maneuver, that the crew will be allowed to sleep another couple of hours. At this time, Apollo 11 is some 27,529 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,812 feet per second. The Black Team of Flight Controllers has settled in for the night. Everything rather quiet here in the Control Room. We're anticipating a playback of yesterday afternoon's TV transmission from Apollo 11 which lasted some hour and a half in which the camera was taken into the Lunar Module at the end of it's cable. This will be played back for the Flight Controllers who, at that time, were - most of them were asleep. At 64 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.|P
0652801|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 65 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 3 1/2 hours remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew of Apollo 11. However, this will likely run into more like 5 1/2 hours remaining. Countdown clock for lunar landing now showing 37 hours, 18 minutes. Apollo 11 now 25,280 nautical miles out from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 3,832 feet per second. In terms of distance - stand by, we thought we had some Earth reference numbers, but apparently that display is not up at this time. Present weight of the spacecraft 96,029 pounds. Presently being tracked by the tracking station at Honeysuckle Creek in Australia. And at 65 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0662911|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 66 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 11 presently 22,952 nautical miles out from the Moon, and traveling at a velocity of 3,858 feet per second. 2 hours 29 minutes remaining in the sleep period. However, as mentioned earlier, this likely will run another 2 hours. Clock counting down to lunar landing, showing 36 hours 16 minutes. Still tracking through the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia tracking station. And, all is rather quiet here in the Control Center during the sleep watch. At 66 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0672802|PAO|This is Apollo Control 67 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Mid-course correction burn number 4 has been deleted from the Flight Plan on the recommendation to Flight Director, Glynn Lunney from the Flight Dynamics Officer, Jay Green. The maneuver, had it been carried out as planned, would be in the neighborhood of one-half foot per second velocity change. As it is now, the trajectory is being predicted to arrive at near point or closest approach of about 62 nautical miles plus or minus two miles if nothing else is done to the trajectory. That is if no maneuver is made. The spacecraft cabin pressure now holding at 4.7 pounds per square inch. Temperature, 60 degrees F. The planned sleep period has another hour and one-half to go but as mentioned earlier it will likely run another couple hours in as much as mid-course correction burn number 4 will not be made and the crew will not have to spend the time preparing to do the burn - align the platform and do all the chores necessary for doing a maneuver of this sort. Clock counting down to lunar landing showing 35 hours, 17 minutes. And at 67 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
0682808|PAO|This is Apollo control 68 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 2 hours and 31 minutes remaining crew sleep period according to the revised schedule inasmuch as mid-course correction burn number 4 has been omitted. Still being tracked - Apollo 11 is still being tracked by the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station. And, here in Mission Control, yesterday's hour and a half long television pass as the crew manned the LM for the first time in checkout is being replayed. This will be piped across to the news center for anyone who might want to view it again. At 68 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control.|P

0691822|LMP|Good morning. Are you planning a mid-course correction 4 this morning?|T
0691827|CC|That's negative. Mid-course number 4 is not required. We were going to let you sleep in until about 71 hours if you'd like to turn over.|T
0691838|LMP|Okay. That'll be fine. ...|T
0691848|CC|Say again, Buzz. You were cut off there.|T

0710342|CC|Roger 11. Good morning. When you - -|T
0710350|LMP|Would you like the O2 purge this morning?|T
0710354|CC|Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a Flight Plan update containing - I guess that, and some other items for you.|T
0710410|LMP|Okay. Stand by.|T
0710700|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update.|T
0710705|CC|Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're coming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: a maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high-gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal Flight Plan at 74 hours GET. Over.|T
0710909|LMP|Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplinked REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 degrees - now is this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?|T
0710946|CC|This is with the - -|T
0710947|LMP|- - ... antenna and, pitch - -|T
0710951|CC|- - This is with the new REFSMMAT, Buzz.|T
0711000|LMP|You said you want the P52 done at that attitude with the new REFSMMAT?|T

0711234|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0711241|CMP|Houston, go ahead.|T
0711243|CC|Roger, 11. Correction on my last. At 73:20, we uplink you the new REFSMMAT. And at 73:30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old REFSMMAT. And then torque around to the new REFSMMAT and run your P52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. Over.|T
0711313|CMP|Roger, Understand.|T
0711315|CC|I've got consumables update, when you're ready to copy.|T
0711322|LMP|I just got up, but you didn't catch me on that one.|T
0711326|CC|I say I have one for you.|T
0711356|LMP|Okay. We're ready to copy that consumable update.|T
0711359|CC|Roger. As of GET 68:00, RCS total minus 4.5 percent, corresponding to approximately minus 53 pounds. Alfa minus 6.0 percent, minus 1.0 percent, minus 7.0 percent, minus 3.0 percent; H2 total, minus 1.2 pounds; O2 total, plus 10 pounds. Over.|T
0711450|LMP|Roger. And our readouts onboard are Alfa is 82, Bravo is 84, Cocoa is 84, and Delta is 87.|T
0711509|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0711514|LMP|And you want us to cycle the O2 and H2 fans, I imagine, huh?|T

0711531|LMP|Okay.|T
0712327|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I have a status report for you.|T
0712334|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
0712338|LMP|Roger. On sleep; CDR, CMP, 7.5; LMP, 6.5. Over.|T

0712354|LMP|Negative. LMP 6.5.|T
0712357|CC|Roger. 7.5, 7.5 and 6.5. And, I got a few words for you here on the SPS engine performance. Over.|T
0712414|LMP|Okay. We're ready to listen.|T
0712418|CC|Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC readings is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage onboard correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.|T
0712537|CDR|Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.|T
0712540|CC|Houston. Out.|T
0713126|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 71 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Moon now 11,232 nautical miles approaching at a velocity of 4,141 feet per second.|P

0713348|CDR|Houston, do you read Apollo 11?|T
0713350|CC|Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.|T
0713400|LMP|Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.|T
0713412|CC|Roger.|T
0713416|LMP|It's quite an eerie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.|T
0713427|CC|Roger.|T
0713431|LMP|And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine.|T
0713456|LMP|And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.|T
0713540|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0713545|LMP|Go ahead.|T
0713547|CC|Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand-hold this, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.|T
0713625|LMP|Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.|T
0713630|CC|Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not-to-interfere basis, of course. Over.|T
0713643|LMP|Okay.|T
0713647|CC|And on the exposures we're looking for an 1/8 of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.|T
0713711|LMP|Roger. We copy.|T
0713713|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0713915|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0713924|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0713925|CC|Roger. We'd like to do a little CRYO tank balancing. So, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the CRYO switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.|T
0713948|CMP|Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.|T
0713951|CC|Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.|T
0714014|CDR|... bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.|T
0714031|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0714311|CDR|... We've got quite a few pictures ...|T
0714406|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. I think we have COMM again. We heard you calling. Over.|T
0714427|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.|T
0714449|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters OFF for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?|T
0714457|CC|That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF and oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.|T
0714506|CMP|Okay.|T
0714508|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0714513|CMP|I have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF; I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.|T
0714518|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0715216|CMP|Houston. Apollo 11. The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.|T
0715224|CC|Oh, very good.|T
0715600|CDR|And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.|T
0715636|CC|Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.|T
0715652|CDR|That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.|T
0715707|CC|Roger.|T
0715759|PAO|That last transmission was from Neil Armstrong.|P
0715921|CDR|Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But, all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.|T
0715952|CC|I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it?|T
0715958|CDR|Really has.|T

0721437|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.|T
0721444|CDR|Okay. We went to high-gain. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.|T
0721448|CC|Roger. We missed an OMNI switch there. Over.|T
0721455|CDR|All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.|T
0721530|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that's normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.|T
0721549|CDR|Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?|T
0721555|CC|Roger. Press on.|T
0721725|CDR|And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.|T
0721730|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0721739|CMP|And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.|T
0721745|CC|That's for sure.|T
0721750|PAO|That was a Mike Collins comment.|P

0722936|CC|Roger. Hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office, especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.|T
0722946|CC|Okay. First off, it looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil, "The Czar of the Ship." I think maybe they got the wrong mission.|T
0723006|CC|West Germany has declared Monday to be "Apollo Day." School children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places.|T

0723104|CC|- over at Buzz's bamboo pole.|T
0723110|CC|In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.|T

0723212|CC|And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the sports world, the Houston Astros rallied in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak. The Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out, Jesus Alou stroked a single to right field. John Edwards hit another single to right, and Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice fly by Dennis Menke brought in the final run. They really came through in the ninth.|T
0723255|CC|And other games in the National League - -|T

0723402|CC|You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.|T

0723458|CMP|Who said all that?|T
0723500|CC|(Laughter) Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now we checked with Flight Operations for all the signs for the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.|T
0723550|CDR|Houston, 11. You're cutting out ...|T

0723741|CDR|Roger. You cut out after Tommy Jacobs. I guess we got into antenna switching problems.|T
0723748|CC|Okay. Following Tommy Jacobs, we have the hot smoking word from a local Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems.

The expected orbit following that maneuver is 169.2 by 61 nautical miles. To repeat, the LOS AOS times we will lose signal with Apollo 11 at 75 hours 41 minutes 23 seconds as it goes behind the Moon. Given a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion number 1 burn we will acquire the signal at 76 hours 15 minutes 29 seconds.

0760642|LMP|Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.|O

0761106|CMP|Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers; give them some scientific name. (laughter)|O
0761115|LMP|It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.|O
0761119|CMP|A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.|O
0761125|LMP|Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?|O
0761140|LMP|That is, the older they get.|O
0761149|CMP|Well, we're at 180 degrees -|O

0761205|CMP|Pitchdown, so we're looking forward, alright. I wonder what kind of a rate we ought to - -|O
0761210|LMP|We got 4 minutes to get there.|O
0761212|CMP|Alright.|O
0761213|LMP|We'll never make it. There's a couple of new craters.|O

0761335|LMP|What did you want, Mike?|O
0761338|CMP|A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?|O
0761353|LMP|Yes, you were at 2 -|O

0762235|CC|Roger. We copy your burn status report. And the spacecraft is looking good to us on telemetry.|T
0762248|CDR|Roger. Everything looks good up here.|T
0762300|PAO|That burn report was by Neil Armstrong.|P
0762702|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're showing spacecraft weight in lunar orbit of 72,004 pounds.|P
0763434|CDR|Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. At this time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and one on TV. There's no substitute for actually being there.|T
0763511|CC|Roger. We concur, and we certainly wish we could see it firsthand, also.|T
0763522|PAO|That was Neil Armstrong.|P
0763532|CDR|We're going over the Messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and Messier A we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. I don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks.|T
0763556|CC|Okay. Just roughly, it looks like you are about 120 miles or 13O miles right now - make that 127 miles.|T
0763713|CDR|We're approaching PDI point now. Over -|T
0763724|CDR|There's Secchi in sight.|T
0763748|LMP|We're going over Mount Marilyn at the present time, and it's ignition point.|T

0764128|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0764134|CDR|Go ahead.|T
0764135|CC|11, Houston. During your SPS burn as played back on tape down there, we've observed the nitrogen tank Bravo pressure in the SPS system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. It's holding steady right now. We'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. Over.|T
0764203|CDR|Roger. Thank you.|T
0764204|CC|Oh - and it has held steady - -|T
0764206|CDR|Currently going over Maskelyne Mas -|T
0764210|CDR|Okay.|T
0764211|CDR|And Boothill, Duke Island, Sidewinder, looking at Maskelyne W, that's the yaw around checkpoint, and just coming into the terminator. At the terminator it's ashen gray. As you get farther away from the terminator, it gets to be a lighter gray, and as you get closer to the subsolar point, you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground, according to the ... limited observation, anyway.|T
0764249|CC|Roger, 11. We're recording your comments for posterity.|T
0764256|CDR|(Laughter) Okay.|T
0764301|PAO|And again, that was Neil Armstrong with the report.|P
0764303|CMP|Did somebody in the background - do they accuse us of being compromisers?|T
0764306|CC|Huh!|T
0764319|CDR|And landing site is well into the dark here. I don't think we're going to be able to see anything of the landing site this early.|T
0764342|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you have a free minute, could you give us your onboard readout of N2 tank Bravo, please. And we'd like to make sure you understand that ever since you stopped thrusting with the SPS, the temperature in this tank has remained steady. Over. Make that the pressure has remained steady.|T
0764407|CMP|Rog. We understand tank pressure has stayed steady. Thank you.|T
0764413|LMP|Roger. We're showing the N2 tank pressure and the tank Bravo to he 1960, something like that, and Alfa is, oh, about 22 - about 2250. Over.|T
0764434|CC|Roger. We show 2249 in Alfa and 1946 down here.|T
0764444|LMP|Okay.|T
0765319|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with some roll, pitch, and yaw angles in which to stop this so called ORB RATE that I'm doing.|T
0765328|CC|Roger. Standby.|T
0765345|CC|We'll have them for you in a minute, 11.|T
0765351|CMP|Okay. And time to stop also, please.|T
0765355|CC|Yes, indeed.|T
0765634|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0765641|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0765642|CC|Roger. We show you, in the Flight Plan, staying in orbital rate until about 79 hours 10 minutes. Do you have some particular attitude or reason for wanting to go inertial? Over.|T
0765701|CMP|No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79:10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.|T
0765707|CC|Roger. And we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus. Over.|T
0765728|LMP|Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is, oh, pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus.|T
0765754|CMP|We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -|T
0765754|CC|Okay, Aristarchus is at Tango Echo 9 on your ATO chart. It's about 394 miles north of track. However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. And, take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.|T
0765834|CDR|Both looking.|T
0765835|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0765914|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin discussing the earthshine.|P
0770301|CDR|Houston, 11. It might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing of 45 west.|T
0770309|CC|Say again, please, 11.|T
0770323|CDR|You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.|T
0770333|CC|Roger. You'll be crossing 45 west at 77:04:10 or about 40 seconds from now. Over. Thirty seconds from now.|T
0770346|CDR|Okay.|T
0770448|CC|Apollo 11, when we lose the S-band, we'd like to get OMNI Charlie from you. And update my last, that 77:04 was the time when Aristarchus should become visible over your horizon. 77:12 is point of closest approach south of it. Over.|T
0770514|CDR|Okay. That sounds better because we just went by Copernicus a little bit ago.|T
0770519|CC|Roger. We show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now.|T
0770525|CDR|Righto.|T
0770707|LMP|Houston, when a star sets up here, there's no doubt about it. One instant it's there, and the next instant it's just completely gone.|T
0770716|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0770921|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We request you select OMNI Charlie at this time. Over.|T
0770930|LMP|Okay. Going to OMNI Charlie.|T
0770932|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0771157|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0771201|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.|T
0771207|LMP|Roger. Seems to me, since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...|T
0771232|CC|Roger.|T
0771251|CDR|Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.|T
0771329|CC|Roger, 11. We copy.|T
0771423|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if I'm lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it at about a zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.|T
0771515|CC|11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.|T
0771533|CMP|Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.|T
0771542|CMP|No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.|T
0771547|CC|Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?|T
0771600|LMP|Well, I guess it would be the inner edge of the west-northwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.|T
0771619|CC|11, Houston. Have you used the monocular on this? Over.|T
0771629|CMP|Stand by one.|T
0771800|CMP|Roger. Like you to know this quest for science has caused me to lose my lunch. It's supposed to be around here somewhere, but I can't find it.|T
0771808|CC|11, this is Houston. We're - we're hearing only a partial COMM. Say again please.|T
0771818|CMP|I think ...|T
0771841|LMP|Houston, we will give it a try if we have the opportunity on next pass, when we are not in the middle of lunch, and trying to find the monocular.|T
0771852|CC|Roger. Copied you that time. Expect in the next REV you will probably be getting ready for LOI-2.|T
0771907|CC|So, let's wind this up, and since we've got some other things to talk to you about in a few minutes. Over.|T
0771919|LMP|Okay.|T
0771949|PAO|Apollo 11 will be in acquisition for another 20 minutes during its first revolution of the Moon.|P
0772243|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0772249|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0772252|CC|11, this is Houston. We're targeting - planning to make the LOI-2 burn now using bank A only. We'll have the PAD and everything for you next time around. Just trying to economize a little on bank B. Bank B is holding, though.|T
0772315|CDR|Roger. Understand.|T
0772317|CC|Capcom -|T
0773153|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
0773202|CDR|Go ahead.|T
0773204|CC|11, Houston. In order to improve the communications a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high-gain antenna. We're recommending a pitch angle of 0, yaw 355 - I say again 355, the track switch to MANUAL, and wide beam-width. Over.|T
0773241|LMP|Okay. You ready to switch to high-gain now?|T
0773244|CC|That's affirmative.|T
0773308|CC|11, Houston. Do you read?|T
0773318|LMP|Roger. We read you. It seems to be rather marginal on the high-gain.|T
0773324|CC|Roger. We concur.|T
0773341|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a time of crossing the prime meridian 150 west? Over.|T
0773347|CC|Roger. Stand by about a half a second, here. Okay. Your time of crossing the 150 west meridian will be 77:50:05. Over.|T
0773410|CMP|Thank you.|T
0773424|CC|11, this is Houston. We have about 6 minutes remaining until LOS, and in order that we may configure our ground lines, we'd like to know if you're still planning to have the TV up with the beginning of the next pass. Over.|T
0773448|CDR|Roger, Houston. We'll try to have it ready.|T
0773451|CC|This is Houston. We are inquiring if it is your plan to. Over.|T
0773500|CDR|It never was our plan to; but it's in the Flight Plan, so I guess we'll do it.|T
0773505|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
0773547|CC|11, Houston.|T
0773553|CDR|Roger. Go ahead.|T
0773554|CC|For use in connection with that time on the prime meridian crossing, you have an orbital period now of 2 hours 8 minutes and 37 seconds. Over.|T
0773610|CMP|Thank you.|T
0773611|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0773816|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. A little over 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems parameters and orbit are looking good from the ground. We have AOS on the other side at 78:23:31. Over.|T
0773840|CDR|Roger. 78:23:21.|T
0773843|CC|Roger. That was 31 on the end.|T
0773851|CDR|Okay.|T
0774020|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal from Apollo 11 on its first lunar revolution. We will acquire the spacecraft on the next revolution at 78 hours 23 minutes 31 seconds. The orbital period for Apollo 11's present orbit: 2 hours 8 minutes 37 seconds. And, as you heard we passed up to the crew information that we would perform the LOI-2 burn using only bank A. The banks are the drive mechanisms for the ball valves in the Service Propulsion System. They open and close these ball valves. The valves allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the engine. There are redundant valves and redundant banks, banks A and B. There was apparently - they are driven by nitrogen and that was the reference to the pressure drop there. It was apparently a leak in nitrogen tank B during the LOI 1 burn. This burn was performed with both banks open. The engine can be operated with only one bank. It's apparent that the tank leaked only during the burn while the bank was actuated. Pressure has held steady since the end of the burn and the experts are reducing the data and looking at the leak rate, determining whether it was constant throughout the burn, what - precisely what the situation is. We're showing pressure in tank B of 1960 psi. In tank A 2250 psi. Both of these are well above the red lines of 400 pounds psi.|P
0774116|LMP|That's why I'm trying to get it out.|O
0774216|LMP|No alignment this REV, huh?|O
0774302|LMP|Mike, I guess the name of the game is to go back to - B OMNI?|O
0774310|CMP|Huh?|O
0774313|LMP|Go back to B in OMNI?|O
0774318|CMP|Well, let's see - when we come over the hill next time, we're supposed to have them on the high-gain, I think.|O
0774325|LMP|Not sure of that.|O
0774329|CMP|...|O
0774331|CMP|Did you use this thing?|O
0774333|CDR|No.|O
0774334|LMP|Well, let's get rid of it then; I can't see a crapping ...|O
0774426|LMP|77:44 - okay, - LOS is right on schedule.|O
0774436|CMP|77:50, we'll be at the prime meridian; now, I can set that map up so it'll tell us where we are.|O
0774443|CDR|Okay.|O
0774445|CMP|Geez, we're ahead on this eat period - we're behind on the last eat period or something. We got a ...|O
0774516|CMP|I think, Buzz, if you put - put the high-gain to MANUAL and go pitch 20 - yaw 360 - pitch minus 20, I guess - -|O
0774526|LMP|Minus 20; yes, that would be better.|O
0774528|CMP|- - and yaw 360 - That's okay assuming I'm at the right attitude, but I ain't going to be at the right attitude - not without wasting a lot of gas. Put -|O
0774536|LMP|That's fine, but -|O
0774542|CDR|If you did, it would be very interesting that way.|O
0774546|CMP|Yes. Oh, crap.|O
0774555|LMP|We get high-gain and we get TV at the same time - -|O
0774558|CMP|Well, I better start maneuvering then; doggone it, I've been yawed out of plane somehow. Let's see, we're pitched down - we want to pitch back up - pitched down, doggone it. ACCEL COMMAND, pitch down.|O
0774617|CDR|Okay, well, are we going to unlock the camera store and get all that claptrap put together?|O
0774623|LMP|Yes.|O
0774624|CDR|Okay.|O
0774642|LMP|Which window you want to operate out of, so I can figure out how to put the monitor on?|O
0774648|CDR|Well, I suppose the best one would be the center window, don't you think?|O
0774657|LMP|Probably, I don't know; wait until we get into attitude.|O
0774700|CDR|Get into attitude - see what we think.|O
0774801|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 77 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Here in Mission Control Center, Houston we're at the process of changing shifts. Cliff Charlesworth Green Team of Flight Controllers very shortly will be leaving their consoles. Meanwhile, Apollo 11 passing over the far side of the Moon out of acquisition. Our last orbital parameter readings on our flight dynamics orbital digital displays indicated an apogee of 168.5 nautical miles, a perilune of 1 - correction, a perilune of 61.2 nautical miles. We're currently planning a change-of-shift briefing at approximately 2:30 Central Daylight Time or soon thereafter as is practicable. The change-of-shift briefing will include only our Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth. It's expected to be of short duration since we will have a TV pass soon after the reacquisition of the spacecraft. At 77 hours, 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0774819|CMP|Oh, shit; this pitch here is no good; 32, huh? Pitch 315 I want to be at, huh? Alright. They keep - all they do is they say ORB rate and that little attitude right there and right there applies to the rest of this page, all of that page, and over to this page.|O
0774846|CDR|Okay, so that's the one we'll do.|O
0774850|CMP|Okay, that's the way I'm rolling.|O
0774851|CDR|And we'll take the - we'll have high-gain - -|O
0774854|CMP|Yes.|O
0774855|CDR|- - and we'll get the camera out of the center window, if that looks reasonable.|O
0774902|CMP|Okay.|O
0774906|CDR|We'll have to give them pictures of the moon.|O
0774907|CMP|... I've been plotting on them ... 50:05.|O

0781827|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 78 hours, 18 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 still passing around the far side of the Moon. We are less than 5 minutes now away from time of acquisition on this, the second revolution for Apollo 11. The station to acquire on this pass will be the Goldstone wing site which will feed the television to Mission Control Center, Houston, and thence to all parts of the country. We would expect to come up with television perhaps some several minutes after acquisition since we must first lock up on the downlink and have the scan converter in full operation. So at 78 hours, 19 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0782130|PAO|Mark 2 minutes now from time of predicted acquisition in Mission Control Center. We are standing by.|P
0782210|CDR|- - and you could be busy getting us some high-gain when we get ... About a minute from AOS.|O

0782422|LMP|- - No, no, no - -|T
0782423|CC|- - the bottom of the picture. I guess that's the spot on the tube.|T

0782433|CC|And if you give us P00 and ACCEPT, we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you.|T
0782445|CMP|Okay.|T
0782530|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a - oh, quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a fresh looking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.|T
0782624|CC|Roger. Do you have a location on that one?|T
0782634|LMP|No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.|T
0782638|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
0782641|PAO|That was Buzz Aldrin making a report, a geological report on the back-side pass.|P
0782647|CC|We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.|T
0782710|LMP|That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.|T
0782745|CC|Roger.|T
0782752|CMP|And, we're about 95 or 100 degrees east and coming up on Smyth's Sea.|T
0782802|CC|Say again, 11?|T
0782807|CMP|I'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on Smyth's Sea.|T
0782812|CC|Roger. And for your information, we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now.|T
0782821|CMP|Okay.|T
0782822|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Did you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.|T
0782857|CMP|I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.|T
0782922|CC|This is Houston. Roger.|T
0782927|PAO|That was Mike Collins making that report.|P
0782930|LMP|Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at as we approach the powered descent. Over.|T
0782947|CC|11, this is Houston. Roger. And we're through with the uplink; the computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.|T
0783001|LMP|Roger. Copy.|T
0783009|CMP|Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving toward the LM, pointed straight down toward the radius vector, and that's been despite a number of down minimum pitch impulses.|T
0783029|CC|Roger.|T
0783049|CMP|We're over Smyth's Sea right now.|T
0783051|CC|Roger.|T
0783056|CMP|We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.|T
0783104|CC|We show you about south of the - southwest of the crater Jansky right now.|T
0783128|CMP|Smyth Sea doesn't look much like a sea. It - The area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the maria at all.|T
0783141|CC|Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.|T
0783152|PAO|That exchange between Capcom, Bruce McCandless and Mike Collins aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft.|P
0783206|CMP|We think you're close, but no cigar.|T
0783252|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We acquired TV at 78 hours, 24 minutes, 11 seconds. Currently our orbital parameters show 104. Altitude an apolune of 170.2, a perilune of 61.3 - nautical miles, those are.|P
0783320|CC|11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?|T
0783329|CDR|Roger. We're approaching the approach path to ignition. This is equivalent to 13 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 80 degrees east, I guess - 83 degrees east. Would that correspond to location you're holding at ... present time?|T
0783359|CC|Roger. We're showing your present position as about 77 - 76 degrees east looking back towards the east.|T
0783416|CMP|Hey, you should be looking back at Smyth Sea now.|T
0783419|CC|Roger.|T
0783422|PAO|We've now heard from all three Apollo 11 crew members during this television pass. The individual talking earlier was Neil Armstrong.|P
0783423|CDR|Okay.|T
0783425|LMP|Houston, what you're seeing in the middle of the screen now is the crater Schubert and Gilbert U is in the center right now; and this comes up at about - a little over 12 minutes before powered decent. Instead of me looking - Instead of looking back at it, we'd be looking straight down at it in descent.|T
0783450|CC|Roger.|T
0783455|CC|And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.|T
0783517|CMP|Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.|T
0783546|CC|Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.|T
0783558|CDR|Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those, plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.|T
0783636|CC|Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.|T
0783653|CDR|Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.|T
0783712|CMP|Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.|T
0783720|CC|Roger.|T
0783721|CDR|Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.|T
0783732|CMP|We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.|T
0783742|CC|Okay. We'll be watching for Camp.|T
0783749|CMP|And notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing.|T
0783756|CC|Roger, Mike. We confirm that you've changed the direction of your pitch rate.|T
0783828|CMP|Generally speaking - -|T
0783830|CDR|The crater - -|T
0783830|CMP|- - The tendency seems to be to pull the LM down toward the center of the Moon, as in a gravity gradient experiment.|T
0783839|CC|Roger, 11. We copy - -|T
0783840|CMP|It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may - -|T
0783846|CC|Roger. We copy ...|T
0783846|CDR|...|T
0783848|CMP|It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may just be the peculiarity of the DSKY display.|T
0783853|CC|Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.|T
0783908|CMP|Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.|T
0783914|CC|Roger.|T
0783925|CDR|Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand, and the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.|T
0783948|CC|Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.|T
0784001|CC|And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.|T
0784010|CDR|Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.|T
0784022|CMP|Yea. There's a great - bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - or correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.|T
0784104|PAO|We have been some 17 minutes now into this television pass and standing by continuing to monitor.|P
0784134|CC|Okay; we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.|T
0784148|LMP|Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before powered descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - to the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at this.|T
0784247|CC|Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.|T
0784301|LMP|Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.|T
0784304|CC|Roger.|T
0784308|CMP|And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen minimum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.|T
0784320|LMP|We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -|T
0784328|CC|Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.|T
0784353|CC|Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.|T
0784407|CMP|The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.|T
0784412|CDR|Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.|T
0784439|CC|Roger. That's very interesting - -|T
0784440|CMP|... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.|T
0784445|CC|(Laughter) Amen to that.|T
0784451|CC|Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.|T
0784459|LMP|Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before powered descent.|T
0784538|LMP|All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.|T
0784559|CMP|Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.|T
0784609|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78:53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI-2 and TEI 5 PADs ready for you after the TV, whenever you want to terminate. Over.|T
0784631|CDR|Roger.|T
0784633|CC|And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now.|T
0784657|CC|Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.|T
0784736|CC|And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.|T
0784801|CMP|I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.|T
0784815|CC|Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.|T
0784831|CMP|Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew said, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in higher Sun angles.|T
0784849|CC|Roger.|T
0784855|PAO|We're now some 25 minutes into our television pass.|P
0784907|CDR|Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.|T
0784932|CC|Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and of Secchi Theta.|T
0784945|CDR|And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.|T
0785004|PAO|Watching this pass with a great deal of interest here in mission Control Center is Pete Conrad, the commander for the Apollo 12 mission.|P
0785009|CDR|The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in powered descent.|T
0785030|CC|Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.|T
0785039|CDR|Roger. Thank you.|T
0785044|CMP|I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.|T
0785051|CC|I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.|T
0785057|CMP|I wouldn't be surprised.|T
0785112|CDR|We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.|T
0785136|CC|Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.|T
0785147|CDR|The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.|T
0785209|CC|Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.|T
0785224|LMP|How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?|T
0785234|CC|Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.|T
0785258|CDR|There's a good picture of Boot Hill.|T
0785302|CC|Roger. We're - -|T
0785303|CDR|Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.|T
0785309|CC|Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.|T
0785311|CDR|The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.|T
0785357|CC|Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.|T
0785414|CDR|Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.|T
0785421|CMP|That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.|T
0785442|CDR|And we're approaching the terminator now. See the - -|T
0785449|CC|Roger.|T
0785450|CDR| - contrast increased, and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.|T
0785459|CC|11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.|T
0785520|CMP|Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.|T
0785533|CC|Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.|T
0785545|CC|And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.|T
0785559|CC|Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?|T
0785604|CMP|Affirmative, we are.|T
0785607|LMP|Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.|T
0785612|CC|Roger.|T
0785614|CMP|We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract.|T
0785625|LMP|It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they approach the terminator.|T
0785643|CC|Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.|T
0785653|CMP|And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.|T
0785703|CC|Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.|T
0785712|CMP|I believe!|T
0785745|LMP|And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.|T
0785751|CC|Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.|T
0785757|PAO|There you have it. Our first glimpse of the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission. The eleven crew took us on a guided tour of the front side, plus talked their way through the power descent that lies ahead in tomorrows activities. At 78 hours 58 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor.|P
0785800|CMP|Well, it depends on your point of view. |T
0785804|CC|Roger. Out.|T
0785819|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have an LOI-2 PAD and a TEI-5 PAD. Over.|T

Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the Flight Plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79:30:10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79:52:10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degrees with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back.

We're now looking at the time of burn of 80 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, which should revise our orbital parameters to 65.7 nautical miles by 53.7 nautical miles. A Delta-V of 159.2 feet per second, and a burn duration of 17 seconds, some 17 seconds.

0792219|CMP|Okay.|T
0792223|CMP|Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too. It's all on the onboard tape, the time entry, and the chamber pressure; but to make a long story short, it worked its way up to 100.|T

Also, we have currently in the Flight Plan, you scheduled tomorrow to start entering the LM at about 96 hours GET, and we'd like to know if you have any plans to initiate this ingress into the LM earlier.

0795128|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We are some 20 minutes away, at this time, of ignition for Lunar Orbit Insertion burn number 2. This - the fine tune second burn in the series of two as we have inserted into lunar orbit. For LOI2, the Apollo 11 will be heads down. The burn will be initiated near perilune as the spacecraft passes over the far side of the Moon. Retrograde, like LOI1, but unlike Apollo's 8 and 10. The burn will not be targeted to place a spacecraft into a precise circular orbit. Taking what was learned on Apollo 10, this LOI2 burn is designed to take into account predicted perturbations and gradually circularize itself. The numbers that we're looking at for LOI2, that would be time of ignition, 80 hours 11 minutes 36 Seconds, which should change our orbital parameters, giving us an apolune of 65.7 nautical miles and a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. The Delta-V intended for this burn, 159.2 feet per second. Burn duration anticipated 17 seconds. That's a burn of short duration, but certainly important in that it establishes the proper orbital parameters for the events that lie ahead. As you heard in earlier conversation, between our capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless and crew members aboard the spacecraft. We're GO for LOI-2. During this burn, we'll utilize only the bank A ball valve. The bank referred to here, which there are two mechanisms that drive the ball valves open and shut, causing fuel and oxidizer to mix for ignition. At the present time in Mission Control Center, the last reference you've heard from our capsule communicator reflects that they, on their own peculiar shift schedule, are having a change-of-shift. Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene and we can assume will take over the responsibilities of the conversational flow with the Apollo 11 spacecraft, once we reacquire. At 79 hours 55 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0802439|CDR|Okay.|O
0802445|LMP|It'd be kind of interesting to see some of this dump go on straight from polar orbit. Wonder how long it's going to take before it impacts?|O
0802456|LMP|It obviously - is not really in polar orbit if it's going off - going off that way. Yes, it's inclined to the small angle.|O

0803122|PAO|Mark 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. During this upcoming pass, we will have our second excursion on the part of the Apollo 11 crew into - into the Lunar Module. The LM is to be pressurized by a valve in a tunnel hatch. And, as a point of interest, will remain pressurized following of this period of activation and after the members of the Apollo 11 crew return to the Command Module. For this period of activation, it's definitely planned that Buzz will go into the LM and there is a distinct possibility that Commander Neil Armstrong could - could exercise his option and go into the LM. Our station to acquire, as we come around the far side of the Moon, will be Goldstone. Mark - 1 minute from predicted time of acquisition and we're standing by.|P

0805640|CC|Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more look like it's sloping up at that point? Over.|T
0805706|CDR|It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.|T
0805723|CC|Roger.|T
0805729|PAO|That was Commander Neil Armstrong talking to our Capsule Communicator Charles Duke. Our current orbital readings show an apolune of 65.5, a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. At 80 hours, 58 minutes into the flight, we continue to monitor, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0810000|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours into the flight of Apollo 11, a period of relative quiet. No doubt the Apollo 11 crew quite preoccupied in preparation for the activation of the LM. During this period of relative quiet, we'll pass along the heart rates from the LOI-1 burn, that's LOI-1, not LOI-2 (we have yet to receive those numbers). The heart rate for the Commander Neil Armstrong read 106, for Command Module Pilot Mike Collins, 66, and for the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin we have a reading of 70. At 81 hours, 1 minute into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0810534|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. At 81 hours 5 minutes into the flight. Still a period of relative quiet. Our ground readings indicate that the Apollo 11 spacecraft has completed its Program 52, that's to align the inertial platform. Indications from the ground are that it - this activity went very well. And at 81 hours 6 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0811439|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 15 minutes. It's been an extremely quiet pass. No doubt, the Apollo 11 crew, quite busy at this time. We expect, at the time entry is made into the Lunar Module, Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, will be out of acquisition, traversing over the far side of the Moon. At the present time, we read an altitude, current altitude, reading of 56.7 nautical miles. Our ground displays indicate an apolune of 65.4, a perilune of 53.8 and spacecraft velocity of 5,364 feet per second. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81 hours 16 minutes into the flight.|P
0812257|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're wondering if you've started into the LM yet. Over.|T

0812315|CC|Roger. Thank you much, Neil. We'll be standing by.|T
0812356|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 81 hours 24 minutes now into the flight. The silence of conversation between Mission Control Center, Houston and the crew has broken there moments ago. Charlie Duke called up Apollo 11 and spoke with Neil Armstrong, who indicated that the hatch was out and the probe and drogue removed and they were about ready to open the Lunar Module hatch. Our current altitude shows 54.7 nautical miles, apolune, 65.4, perilune, 53.8. Interestingly enough, the part of the LM activation which we will follow most closely will be at time of reacquisition following our pass over the far side of the Moon. This will be on the front side. It will afford us an opportunity for a communications check with the Lunar Module and there will be a transfer to LM power. At 81 hours 25 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0815049|LMP|Yes. you need one?|O
0815050|CDR|I thought we might just stick my – activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.|O
0815056|LMP|Right here?|O
0815057|CDR|Yes. ...|O
0815101|LMP|We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the - -|O
0815118|CDR|I'll go check around up here.|O

0815123|CDR|I don't think the - -|O
0815125|LMP|This other one got changed.|O

0815130|LMP|You want to do that?|O
0815132|CDR|Yes, I can do that.|O
0815148|LMP|And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?|O
0815217|LMP|Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well ... the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.|O
0815319|LMP|You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?|O
0815324|CDR|Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you - ...|O
0815339|LMP|...|O
0815341|CDR|Yes, dark slide in.|O
0815354|CDR|It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.|O
0815358|LMP|Alright. ... for telling me.|O
0815409|LMP|Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.|O
0815532|LMP|Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A ... - one of them is R and the other is S.|O
0815541|CDR|Yes.|O
0815542|LMP|I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.|O
0815545|CDR|Okay.|O
0815546|LMP|And the S in the surface camera.|O
0815548|CDR|Good idea.|O
0815549|LMP|Even though we're going to use them the other way.|O
0815632|CDR|Do you want to try it out in there?|O
0815635|LMP|I guess we could open the window here, just as well.|O
0815659|LMP|The window's all - frosted over.|O
0815703|CDR|Is it?|O
0815706|LMP|Well, I hate to stick my finger on it; I'm not sure which side it's on.|O
0815709|CDR|We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.|O

0820243|CMP|In a little while.|O
0820246|LMP|About what time?|O
0820251|CMP|About another half hour.|O
0820254|LMP|Before 83 hours?|O
0820305|CDR|Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the sun was on it.|O
0820322|LMP|Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - ... over the horizon.|O
0820420|LMP|I don't think there's any place except in the – in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage -|O
0820431|CDR|In the card, right?|O
0820434|LMP|No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are; 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.|O
0820513|CDR|You got the Flight Plan handy, Mike?|O
0820515|CMP|Yes, I have; just a second.|O
0820518|CDR|I don't want it up here; I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.|O
0820524|CMP|It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the COMM.|O
0820603|LMP|12 feet per second - half an hour.|O
0820614|LMP|Did you say something about taking pictures right now?|O
0820617|CMP|No, no; stop the camera.|O
0820619|LMP|Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.|O
0820628|LMP|One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.|O
0820638|CMP|No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles.|O
0820649|LMP|Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.|O
0820657|CDR|Alright. You want one?|O
0820700|LMP|Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.|O
0820903|CDR|Hand me a towel when you get a chance.|O

0821002|LMP|You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.|O
0821102|LMP|All that'll do is warm it up.|O
0821140|LMP|When do we have AOS?|O
0821148|CMP|Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.|O
0821243|LMP|Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture – of the Earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?|O
0821406|LMP|Unique feature - photography (laughter). ... on the top of it.|O
0821434|LMP|What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th? ...|O
0821450|CDR|Yes. ...|O
0821508|LMP|What do you know, it works!|O
0821516|CDR|I could sure get the stop watch, huh?|O
0821519|LMP|Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.|O
0821529|CDR|...|O
0821530|LMP|...|O
0821531|CMP|I'm just fooling around; what do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.|O
0821549|LMP|Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?|O
0821558|CDR|Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?|O
0821603|LMP|Yes. Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes -|O
0821645|CDR|Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?|O
0821810|CDR|No wonder - ...|O
0821819|CMP|Uh, ...|O
0821823|CDR|... that's the reason - -|O
0821824|CMP|No, I don't think you know; I don't think you know; I don't see how you know.|O
0821829|LMP|Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?|O
0821832|CDR|What's that?|O
0821833|LMP|In the LM, this cover for the camera.|O
0821843|LMP|Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?|O
0822000|LMP|Now, a few pictures of that and one of earthrise and - and then we'll stow it.|O
0822143|LMP|Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.|O
0822209|CDR|Do you know where the shaving cream is?|O
0822214|CMP|Shaving cream?|O
0822215|CDR|Yes.|O

0822251|LMP|How about this thing; you see any need to – to keep that in the LM?|O
0822305|LMP|Neil, what did you do with the - ... camera back sight?|O
0822310|CDR|I haven't had it.|O
0822311|LMP|Okay. What do you think about that?|O
0822314|CDR|I can't think of any reason why we might use it.|O
0822317|LMP|Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?|O
0822403|CMP|He's shaving.|O
0822435|CMP|I'm through with the Flight Plan, Neil, if you want it.|O

0822500|CMP|It wasn't?|O
0822501|CDR|- - ... shaving cream.|O

0822504|CDR|The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but - -|O
0822510|LMP|How much time to AOS, Mike?|O
0822514|CMP|82:30 - about 5 minutes.|O
0822841|LMP|Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.|O

0822855|LMP|You got VHF B available?|O
0822857|CMP|What? Say again?|O
0822903|LMP|I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.|O
0822909|CMP|Not right now, not for another half hour or so.|O
0822911|LMP|No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?|O
0822919|CMP|If I'm going to record your data, I am.|O
0822928|LMP|Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.|O
0822934|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're now within 2 minutes from time of predicted acquisition of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. As we make this pass - near side pass, on the fourth revolution, it will be the first time that we have transferred during this mission to Lunar Module Pilot - power, and a communications check will be performed on the Lunar Module. We should be hearing such things as long counts being given from the spacecraft. Additionally, a new display - the lunar landing site display is now up for the first time in Mission Control Center this flight. It's essentially a blowup for the landing sites 1 and 2. We expect it to stay up through the time of lunar landing. Meanwhile a Mission Control Center Flight Director, Milt Windler, beginning to discuss with members of his Flight Control team items that might be expected after we acquire. We're less than a minute away at this time - at this time from our forecast acquisition. We'll stand by.|P

0823409|CMP|Okeydoke. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see - -|O

And at 83 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0834328|CMP|Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow; I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is reinstalling all that claptrap up in there.|O

0834359|CMP|Yes, forward's okay.|O
0834401|PAO|Apollo 11 has passed out of range with the ground, traversing now over the far side of the Moon. During this pass, we had an extremely successful communications checkout with the Lunar Module using its code name for the first time. Its code name of the Eagle. Buzz Aldrin performed the counting tasks in concert with Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator here on the ground, and at times Buzz's - Buzz's voice, we noted considerable enthusiasm for the way things are going, and at times Charlie Duke shared that enthusiasm. In its maiden checkout in communications, the Lunar Module Eagle, looked good. At 83 hours 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0843113|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
0843120|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
0843121|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACQ went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.|T
0843139|CMP|Go ahead, Owen.|T
0843141|CC|Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.|T
0843218|LMP|Roger. Understand that. Thank you.|T
0843221|CC|Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.|T
0843307|CMP|Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.|T
0843323|CC|Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.|T
0843335|CMP|Okay. Fine.|T
0843336|CC|They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.|T
0843417|CMP|Okay.|T
0843417|LMP|How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?|T
0843422|CC|I'll have to stand by just a moment.|T
0843427|LMP|Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging battery A.|T
0843528|CC|11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.|T
0843543|LMP|Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning; I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.|T
0843553|CC|That's fine, Buzz.|T
0843554|LMP|Terminate battery charging now.|T
0843556|CC|That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your CRYO tanks, would you get your O2 tank 1 and your H2 tank 2 heaters off? Over.|T
0843617|CMP|Okay. I have O2 tank heater 1 off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.|T
0843625|CC|That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.|T
0843644|CMP|Okay.|T
0843648|CC|One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11-9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top of - under tunnel at the top of page 11-9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.|T
0843739|CMP|Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.|T
0843746|CC|11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a pre-sleep check for us before you go to bed.|T
0843807|LMP|Rog. We're in the midst of cycling the O2 and H2 fans now.|T

0845620|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours, 56 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current apolune 65.1 nautical miles, current perilune 54.3 nautical miles. After receiving some noisy signal, Apollo 11 has locked back on in fine form. That was Buzz Aldrin speaking with Owen Garriott here in the Mission Control Center. I expect we will take a second look at why we had to lock on manually. As we receive any updates on this, we'll pass them along.

0850930|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
0850931|CC|11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.|T
0851004|CDR|Okay. We understand.|T
0851011|CC|11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.|T

0851328|CC|11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look onboard? Over.|T
0851337|LMP|Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and oh, about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.|T
0851419|CC|Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.|T
0851528|CC|11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.|T
0851539|LMP|Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.|T
0851557|CC|Okay. Thank you.|T
0851624|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier off a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.|T
0851636|LMP|Okay.|T
0851638|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 85 hours, 17 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. What you heard in the conversation between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin was following a communications check in which we secured the uplink carrier for some 30 seconds and waited to give it a period of time of approximately 3 minutes, to see if the spacecraft would reacquire. We appeared to reacquire in fine form on this first test. We will repeat it - this test a second time, delaying approximately 4 minutes before we place a call to Apollo 11. At 85 hours 17 minutes, we currently read an altitude - spacecraft altitude of 56.1 nautical miles. Present velocity shows 5,367 feet per second. At apolune 65 nautical miles, perilune 54.4 nautical miles. Present weight in orbit remains a static 70,502 pounds. Present time in orbit as shown on our displays, 1 hour 58 minute 40 seconds.

0851846|LMP|Couldn't have done better myself.|O
0852007|CC|11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?|T
0852025|LMP|Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.|T
0852025||(Music: unidentified)|T
0852050|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was re-enabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.|T
0852113|LMP|No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.|T
0852138|CC|11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.|T
0852159|LMP|Roger. Zeroed.|T
0852638|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 85 hours 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We've run 2 tests thus far with the S-band antenna which has reacquired nicely on both occasions. We're standing by for further possible conversations with the crew at this time, we're some 15 minutes away from predicted time of loss of signal on Apollo 11. Currently we read an apolune of 65 nautical miles - a perilune of 54.4 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

0852826|CMP|Somebody will be up.|T
0852828|CC|Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.|T
0852843|CMP|Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.|T
0852850|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you.|T
0852856|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 85 hours 29 minutes now into the flight. That was Mike Collins reporting to the Capsule Communicator Owen Garriott that the Apollo 11 crew completing dinner at this time. And earlier perhaps as you listened to the air/ground, you heard some music in the background, soft music which would indicate that the this was being played in concert with their evening meal. When we reacquire, we expect one of the three crew members to still be, at least one to be still awake as we run a further check on our spacecraft antenna.

The Mission Control Center has isolated our earlier loss of lock on with the S-Band antenna to a faulty power supply at Goldstone which in turn introduced noisy data causing a ground based receiver to go out of lock. This power supply, a 24 volt one, has already been replaced at Goldstone. In summary, the spacecraft looks good and the difficulty was caused here on the ground. At 86 hours, 34 minutes, we now read our orbit at 64.9 nautical miles apolune, 54.6 nautical miles perilune. This is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

AOS is confirmed. We'll stand by Capcom's call to the crew. We have data coming in now. After having breakfast and getting all squared away after the night's rest period, the crew will have a rather busy day including the first manned landing on the Moon. Some of the preliminary time's being generated now for maneuvers of the day - will include separation at - a separation burn at 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds. Here goes the call.|P

We'll stay up live on the air-ground loop, and continue to monitor any further conversation between spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans, here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11, which at this time is likely in the middle of their breakfast period.|P
0944046|PAO|This is Apollo Control still standing by as the Apollo 11 - about a third of the way through the frontside pass on revolution number 10. Still in the midst of their breakfast period. Various console positions are preparing numbers for maneuver times, attitudes, and so on for the day's activity to pass to spacecraft communicator who in turn will pass them up to the crew. Probably during this pass - members of the white team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Kranz are drifting into the Control Room now to relieve the night watch - Black Team headed by Glynn Lunney. Glynn Lunney will hold a brief change-of-shift press conference in the Apollo news center in MSC after the handover is complete. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit for any further transmissions from Apollo 11.|P

0951728|LMP|- - Thank you.|T
0951729|CC|Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.|T
0951816|LMP|Okay. We'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl.|T
0951819|CC|Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Colombia.|T
0951842|CC|Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18, with black hair and eyes, and measures 34-1/2, 23, 34-1/2. First runner up was Miss Australia, followed by Miss Israel, and Miss Japan.|T
0951918|CC|While you're on your way back Tuesday night, the American and National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster.|T
0951947|CC|Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it's built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the oldfashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice".|T

Neil Armstrong confirmed that the LM power switch occurred at 95 hours 54 minutes, which would have put that activity about 30 minutes ahead of the Flight Plan's schedule, and that appears to be about the pace that the crew is holding, that Armstrong and Aldrin are holding and getting the LM activated and checked out. At this time Buzz Aldrin has returned to the Command and Service Module where he will be donning his pressure garment and then rejoin Armstrong in Eagle.|P

0992918|CMP|All Columbia systems looking good.|O
0992918|CDR|... Columbia. Systems looking good.|T
0993009|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. We'll reacquire the spacecraft again on the thirteenth revolution in about 45 minutes. At the end of this pass, we passed along the GO for undocking. That maneuver will occur just before we reacquire the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution and will be followed in about 30 minutes later by a small separation maneuver performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module. Checkout of the LM has been going extremely well up to now ahead of schedule. Both vehicles look very good. At 99 hours, 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
0993136|CMP|It's nice and quiet over here, isn't it?|O
0993151|CMP|Eagle, you read Columbia?|O
0993153|LMP|Roger. Loud and clear.|O
0993158|CMP|Okay, everything's going well. Everything's quiet over on this side.|O
0993202|LMP|You bet.|O
0993204|CMP|Okay. I'm standing by to record your data anytime it's convenient for you; angles coming up in another 2 minutes.|O
0993226|LMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to B DATA now.|O
0993231|CMP|Roger and out.|O
0993255|LMP|Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?|O
0993259|CMP|Read you loud and clear, Buzz.|O

0993305|CMP|...|O
0993444|LMP|Mike, are you in AGS CAL attitude now?|O
0993450|CMP|That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS CAL, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.|O
0993505|LMP|Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.|O
0993536|CMP|Okay, it looks real quiet now; I'm ready to go right now.|O
0993555|CMP|Buzz, you copy?|O
0993605|CMP|Buzz, you copy?|O
0993608|LMP|Okay, Mike. Thanks.|O
0993613|CMP|Now, ... might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go anytime you're ready.|O
0993619|LMP|Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.|O
0993742|LMP|Okay, I'm starting my 5-minutes rate - right now.|O
0993957|CMP|As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll; I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.|O
0994012|LMP|Roger.|O
0994013|CMP|Looks like a ...|O
0994027|CMP|Halfway through it, it looks like I've wandered 4 or 5 degrees in roll is about all.|O
0994035|LMP|Yes, those look like good ones right now.|O
0994118|LMP|Mike, what's your SEP time?|O
0994123|CMP|A few minutes.|O
0994146|CMP|GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.|O
0994157|CMP|I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess, ...|O
0994219|CMP|I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that DELTA-V be in the same position that they wanted.|O
0994230|LMP|Yes, I agree.|O
0994234|CMP|So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed Flight Plan; it might be wise to try to SEP about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of SEP that's precise whenever they want it.|O
0994302|CMP|I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.|O
0994318|LMP|Okay, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.|O
0994322|CMP|No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.|O
0994342|CDR|Just hanging on - and punching.|O
0994345|CMP|I didn't know ... radio. ... I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."|O
0994619|CMP|You cats take it easy on the lunar surface; if I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.|O
0994625|LMP|Okay, Mike.|O
0994634|CDR|I just pressurized the DPS. ... looks okay, Mike.|O
0994637|CMP|Roger that.|O
0994917|LMP|Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?|O
0994926|CMP|Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head; that's hard south; don't irradiate me.|O
0994932|LMP|Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know -|O
0994946|CMP|Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS CAL.|O
0994952|LMP|...|O
0995017|CMP|How'd the AGS CAL work out?|O
0995021|LMP|Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers.|O
0995031|CMP|Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.|O
0995100||BEGIN LUNAR REV 13|T
0995120|CMP|Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation-burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your Flight Plan for the undock attitude.|O
0995136|LMP|Okay.|O
0995311|CMP|When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.|O
0995328|LMP|Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?|O
0995331|CMP|I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.|O
0995337|LMP|Yes, we're through with that now.|O
0995340|CMP|Thank you. I'm maneuvering the ...|O
0995843|CMP|That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong ... for you.|O
0995848|LMP|Very good.|O
0995956|LMP|Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?|O
1000002|CMP|Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.|O
1000024|LMP|Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?|O
1000028|CMP|Yes, f:8 at 1/250th.|O
1000037|CMP|And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.|O
1000353|CMP|How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy?|O
1000400|CDR|That'll be fine.|O
1000405|CMP|Okay.|O
1000411|CDR|What have you got for AOS, Mike?|O

1001420|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 14 minutes. We are now less than 2 minutes from reacquiring the spacecraft on the thirteenth revolution. When next we hear from them the Lunar Module should be undocked from the Command and Service Module. We're presently about 25 minutes away from the separation burn which will be performed by Mike Collins in the Command Module to give the LM and the CSM a separation distance after descent orbit insertion maneuver of about 2 miles. We have some times on the upcoming events. The separation maneuver is scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 100 hours, 39 minutes, 50 seconds, the descent orbit insertion maneuver which will be performed on the backside of the Moon set for 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and the beginning of the powered descent at 102 hours, 33 minutes, 4 seconds. We're now 55 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 11 on the thirteenth revolution. During this revolution we will be doing the separation maneuver. We'll also be giving the crew on the Lunar Module a GO-NO/GO for the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. We'll stand by now to reacquire the spacecraft.|P

Out of contact - out of radio contact, the DOI maneuver scheduled to come at 101 hours, 36 minutes, 14 seconds, and it will be a 76.4 foot per second burn. The burn duration 29.8 seconds, and the resulting orbit for the LM will be 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles. When next we acquire the Lunar Module, it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles on its way down to a low point of about 50,000 feet from where the powered descent to the lunar surface will begin. As the spacecraft went around the corner, all systems on both vehicles looked very good. Everything is GO here in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft for the Descent Orbit Insertion to occur in 6 minutes, 38 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 101 hours 29 minutes.|P

Of course, we don't have radio contact with the spacecraft. In Mission Control here where normally maneuvers of that sort would be monitored on plot boards in front, and we have the boards set up there for the powered descent. To occur about 1/2 rev from now over landing site 1. Flight Controllers standing around in little groups. Not much that we can do at this point until reacquiring the spacecraft. We're now 20 minutes - or 20 seconds rather from ignition on the Descent Orbit Insertion. It will be a 29.8 second burn of the 9800-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System. We should be burning at this time. The result of this maneuver will be to put the spacecraft into an orbit 57.2 by 8.5 nautical miles, and it would remain in that orbit until powered descent.|P
1013654|PAO|We should have a cut-off by this time. That should have completed Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. We would expect to reacquire the Command Module first. Command Module acquisition time is 102 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. And, that will be just about 2 minutes prior to the time that we will have reacquired the Lunar Module. The LM acquisition time is 102 hours, 16 minutes, 25 seconds. That is about 37 minutes, 20 seconds from now on the CSM at about a little less than 2 minutes longer than that for the LM.

The time until the ignition for the powered descent is 38 minutes, 55 seconds. Here in Mission Control, people still standing and waiting. I believe back in the viewing room, we probably have one of the largest assemblages of space officials that we've ever seen in one place. Included among the viewers are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Jim Elms, Director of the Electronic Research Center at Cambridge, Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of NASA's Lewis Research Center, Rocco Petrone, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center is there. From Marshall Space Center, we have Dr. Wernher von Braun, the Director, and his Deputy, Dr. Eberhard Rees. Also a large number of Astronauts including Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, Jim McDivitt, and John Glenn. We also see Dr. Kurt Debus, Director of the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Edgar Cortright, Director of the Langley Research Center. Dr. S. Draper, Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentations Laboratory is also in the viewing room. Here in the Control Room proper, down on the floor a number of Astronauts including Pete Conrad, Fred Haise, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Sitting beside us in the back row of consoles here is Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. Further down on the line is General Sam Phillips, Director of the Apollo Program. Also Chris Kraft is here, Director of Flight Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center, and George Low of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. We also see in the back viewing room, Secretary of the Air Force, Seamans, and many others who I'm sure we can't see through the glass.

1021132|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 102 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11. We're now 2 minutes 53 seconds from reacquiring the spacecraft, 21 minutes 23 seconds from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface. It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control. A few moments ago Flight Director, Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and closed with a remark "Good luck to all of you". Here on the front of our display boards we have a number of big plot boards which will be used to keep track of the burn progress. Along the more important of those is one which will show the performance of the onboard guidance systems, both the primary and the back up guidance system and compare the guidance systems with the Manned Space Flight Network tracking. These displays, by the time this is all over, will look a great deal like a combination Christmas tree and Fourth of July. We're now 1 minute 39 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module, Columbia. Acquisition of the Lunar Module will come a little less than 2 minutes after that. At the time we acquire the LM it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles descending toward the 50,000 foot pericynthion from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated. If for any reason the crew does not like the way things look as they are coming across the pericynthion, simply by not initiating the maneuver they will remain in a safe orbit of 60 miles by 50,000 feet, and if they desired they would be able to attempt the powered descent on the following revolution at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 104 hours 26 minutes. We're now coming up on 30 seconds to acquisition of the Command Module and we'll stand by for that event.|P

1025604|LMP|We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.|T
1025649|CC|Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.|T

1030205|CDR|Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.|T
1030243|CC|Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.|T
1030334|CDR|You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.|T

1030358|CDR|The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5 to 50-foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1 and 2-foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.|T

1030849|LMP|Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.|T
1030911|CC|Roger, Buzz. Stand by.|T
1031018|CC|Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.|T
1031026|LMP|Roger. I concur with that.|T
1031028|CC|Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.|T
1031047|CDR|Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902:04:40. When I release it now, I get 902:04:49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.|T
1031110|CC|Roger.|T

1031149|CDR|Okay.|T
1031246|CDR|I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.|T

1032256|CC|Roger, Tranquility. We understand. Must be a beautiful sight. Over.|T
1032354|PAO|We would like to point out that the fuel pressure problem that had been called to the attention of the crew, is in the descent system and it is probably downstream of the tanks where a small amount of fluid has been trapped in a line and we don't expect it to cause any problem. The line should be able to take far more pressure than the fluid would exert. In the event that there was an over-pressurization, we would expect that the line would spring a small leak, the pressure would drop rapidly. Again, we point out that we do not see this as a significant problem.|P

1032713|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal now from the Command Module and of course, we'll maintain constant communications with the Lunar Module on the lunar surface. We have some heart rates for Neil Armstrong during that powered descent to the lunar surface. At the time the burn was initiated, Armstrong's heart rate was 110. At touchdown on the lunar surface, he had a heart rate of 156 beats her minute, and the Flight Surgeon reports that his heart rate is now in the 90's. We do not have biomedical on Buzz Aldrin.|P
1033144|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 32 minutes. We have an update on that touchdown time on the lunar surface. This still is not the final, official time which we will get from readout of data, but the refined time is 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds, which would have been 12 minutes 36 seconds after initiating the powered descent. That was 102 hours 45 minutes 40 seconds for touchdown and a total time of powered descent 12 minutes 36 seconds, and we would expect those numbers to change perhaps a little when we get final data readouts.|P

1034420|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 44 minutes. There will be a brief statement from Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, in the building 1 auditorium at 4:30. We also have some updated information on the landing point. It appears that the spacecraft, Eagle, touched down at .799 degrees north, or just about on the lunar equator.

Our projected time for extravehicular activity, at this point, is still very preliminary. I repeat, it could come as soon as 8:00 p.m. Houston time. We won't know for sure about the time, with reasonable certainty until about an hour before the event. Meanwhile, as we'll soon be progressing toward man's first step on the lunar surface, we have an interesting phenomena here in the Mission Control Center, Houston. Something we've never seen before. Our visual of the Lunar Module, our visual display now standing still. Our velocity digitals for Tranquility Base now reading zero. Reverting, if we could, to the terminology of an earlier form of transportation, the railroad. What we're witnessing now, is man's very first trip into space with a station stop along the route.

We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course.

1063646|CC|Stand by.|T
1063737|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.|T

1063858|CC|Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.|T

1071016|CC|On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on an interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. Over.|T
1071110|CMP|Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?|T
1071126|CC|Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.|T
1071135|CMP|Okay.|T
1071136|CC|And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we can track it on the next REV. If you are ready, we have a REFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.|T
1071208|CMP|Okay. P00 in ACCEPT you got. And this is an updated landing site RESFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?|T

1091730|LMP|All right. Move, here roll to the left. Okay. Now you're clear. You're lined up on the platform. Put your left foot to the right a little bit. Okay. That's good. Roll left, Good.|T
1091755|CDR|Okay. Now I'm going to check PLSS here.|T
1091806|LMP|Okay. You're not quite squared away. Roll to the - roll right a little. Now you're even.|T
1091816|CDR|That's okay?|T
1091817|LMP|That's good. You've got plenty of room to your left. It's a little close on the ...|T
1091829|CDR|How am I doing?|T
1091830|LMP|You're doing fine.|T
1091853|LMP|Okay. Do you want those bags?|T
1091854|CDR|Yes. Got it.|T
1091918|CDR|Okay. Houston, I'm on the porch.|T
1091921|CC|Roger, Neil.|T
1091937|LMP|Okay. Stand by, Neil.|T
1091939|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. One minute and 30 seconds to LOS. All systems GO. Over.|T
1091944|CMP|Columbia.|O
1091947|CMP|Columbia. Thank you.|T
1091947|LMP|Stay where you are a minute, Neil.|T
1091949|CDR|Okay. Need a little slack?|T
1092016|PAO|Neil Armstrong on the porch at 109 hours 19 minutes 16 seconds.|P
1092039|CDR|You need more slack, Buzz?|T
1092041|LMP|No. Hold it just a minute.|T
1092042|CDR|Okay.|T
1092050|PAO|25 minutes of PLSS time expended now.|P
1092057|LMP|Okay. Everything's nice and straight in here.|T
1092100|CDR|Okay. Can you pull the door open a little more?|T
1092103|LMP|All right.|T
1092105|CDR|Okay.|T
1092108|LMP|Did you get the MESA out?|T
1092110|CDR|I'm going to pull it now.|T
1092120|CDR|Houston, the MESA came down all right.|T
1092123|CC|This is Houston, Roger. We copy. And we're standing by for your TV.|T
1092141|CDR|Houston, this is Neil. Radio check.|T
1092144|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Break. Break. Buzz, this is Houston. Radio check, and verify TV circuit breaker in.|T
1092155|LMP|Roger, TV circuit breaker's in, and read you loud and clear.|T
1092201|CC|Roger.|T
1092205|CC|And, we're getting a picture on the TV.|T
1092210|LMP|You got a good picture, huh?|T
1092212|CC|There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.|T
1092229|LMP|Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?|T
1092236|CC|Stand by.|T
1092250|CC|Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.|T
1092300|CDR|Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.|T
1092311|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
1092312|CDR|It takes a pretty good little jump.|T
1092326|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. F/2 - 1/160th second for shadow photography on the sequence camera.|T
1092337|LMP|Okay.|T
1092339|CDR|I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. - ground mass is very fine|T
1092414|CDR|Okay. I'm going to step off the LM now.|T
1092426|CDR|That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.|T
1092449|CDR|And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.|T
1092531|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.|T
1092546|CDR|There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.|T
1092655|CDR|Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?|T
1092700|LMP|I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.|T
1092705|CDR|Okay.|T
1092707|LMP|Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.|T
1092714|CDR|Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.|T
1092729|LMP|Okay. It's taut now.|T
1092740|PAO|Unofficial time on the first step - 109:24:20.|P
1092753|LMP|Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.|T
1092756|CDR|I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -|T
1092802|LMP|Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.|T
1092804|CDR|Okay.|T
1092817|CDR|Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in tne shadow now looking up at Buzz in the windows. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible.|T
1092857|LMP|Okay. I'm going to be changing the -|T
1092859|CDR|Okay.|T
1093023|PAO|The surgeon says that -|P
1093024|CDR|The camera is installed on the RCU bracket - -|T
1093030|PAO|The Surgeon says the crew is doing well. Data is good, crew is doing well.|P
1093035|CDR|- and I'm storing the LEC on the secondary strut.|T
1093054|CDR|I'll step out and take some of my first pictures here.|T
1093107|CC|Roger. Neil, we're reading you loud and clear. We see you getting some pictures and the contingency sample.|T
1093130|PAO|35 and a half minutes of PLSS time expended now.|P
1093219|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Did you copy about the contingency sample? Over.|T
1093227|CDR|Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.|T
1093326|LMP|Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.|T
1093328|CDR|Right.|T
1093331|LMP|Okay. That's good.|T
1093400|LMP|Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ... Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.|T
1093414|CDR|This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.|T
1093455|LMP|That looks beautiful from here, Neil.|T
1093457|CDR|It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.|T
1093532|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
1093544|LMP|Okay. The handle is off the ... pushes in about, oh, 6, 8 inches into the surface. I think it's pretty easy ...|T
1093558|CDR|Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.|T
1093608|LMP|Now, you can throw so far.|T
1093610|CDR|You can really throw things a long way up here.|T
1093634|CDR|My pocket open, Buzz?|T
1093636|LMP|Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.|T
1093652|CDR|That in the pocket?|T
1093654|LMP|Yes. Push down.|T
1093656|CDR|Got it?|T
1093658|LMP|No. It's not all the way in. Push it. There you go.|T
1093710|CDR|Contingency sample is in the pocket. My oxygen is 81 percent. I have no flags, and I'm in minimum flow.|T
1093722|CC|This is Houston. Roger, Neil.|T
1093742|LMP|Okay. I have got the camera going at one frame a second.|T
1093746|CDR|Okay.|T
1093754|LMP|And I've got the 80 percent, no flags.|T
1093804|CDR|Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston?|T
1093807|CC|Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.|T
1093822|CC|Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.|T
1093835|CDR|...|T
1093835|LMP|Roger.|T
1093836|CDR|Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.|T
1093842|LMP|Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?|T
1093844|CDR|Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.|T
1093907|CDR|Okay.|T
1093907|LMP|All right. That's got it. Are you ready?|T
1093913|CDR|All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.|T
1093945|LMP|All right. The backup camera's positioned.|T
1093953|CDR|Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.|T
1094018|LMP|Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?|T
1094027|CDR|Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.|T
1094029|LMP|Okay. Back in from ... small little, uh, foot movements ... porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.|T
1094049|CDR|Looks good.|T
1094058|PAO|45 minutes PLSS time expended.|P
1094109|CC|Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.|T
1094120|CDR|Negative.|T
1094125|PAO|It's the sample return containers, the rock boxes that Capcom -|P
1094129|LMP|Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.|T
1094147|LMP|Making sure not to lock it on my way out.|T
1094151|CDR|(Laughter) Particularly good thought.|T
1094157|LMP|That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.|T
1094218|CDR|Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.|T
1094228|CDR|You've got three more steps and then a long one.|T
1094243|LMP|Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.|T
1094251|CDR|There you go.|T
1094254|LMP|Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ...|T
1094301|CDR|A little more. About another inch.|T
1094306|CDR|There, you got it.|T
1094308|LMP|That's a good step.|T
1094309|CDR|Yes. About a 3-footer.|T
1094318|LMP|Beautiful view!|T

1094349|LMP|Looks like the secondary strut - little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.|T

1094400||BEGIN LUNAR REV 18|T
1094407|CDR|...|T
1094407|LMP|... very, very fine powder, isn't it?|T
1094410|CDR|Isn't it fine?|T
1094411|LMP|Right in this area I don't think there's much of any ... fine powder ... clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.|T
1094424|CDR|Notice how you can kick it out.|T
1094429|LMP|Yes. And it bounces and then -|T
1094456|LMP|Reaching down is fairly easy. - get my suit dirty at this stage.|T
1094513|LMP|The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.|T
1094531|LMP|There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to ... backwards ... due to the soft, very soft texture.|T
1094546|CDR|Yes, you're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.|T
1094603|LMP|This pad sure didn't ...|T
1094606|CDR|No. It didn't.|T
1094609|LMP|There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.|T
1094611|CDR|No.|T
1094613|LMP|I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.|T
1094622|CDR|I'd like that.|T
1094625|CDR|Yes, that's - I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.|T
1094632|LMP|I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.|T
1094641|CDR|It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.|T
1094705|LMP|Can't say too much for the visi - for the visibility right here without the visor up. - pretty dark. It looks like there is a -|T

1094914|LMP|Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you ... slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.|T
1094939|LMP|Hey, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?|T
1094942|CDR|Find a purple rock?|T
1094944|LMP|Yes. Very small, sparkly ... fragments ... places ... would make a first guess that some sort of biotite ... We'll leave that to the further analysis ...|T

1095242|CDR|For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of Earth. Underneath, it says, "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.|T

1095440|CDR|Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?|T
1095459|LMP|Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus?|T
1095503|CC|This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It's somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.|T
1095522|LMP|Okay. How's the temperature looking, there?|T

1095833|LMP|Okay. That's all the cable we have. ... not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -|T
1095841|CC|A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?|T
1095852|CC|Okay. That looks good Neil.|T
1095857|CDR|Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?|T
1095902|LMP|Can't get too much further away.|T
1095906|CDR|Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.|T
1095914|CC|Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop for -|T
1095929|CDR|I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.|T
1095936|CC|Roger.|T

1100000|CDR|Okay. I'm going to move it.|T
1100011|CC|Okay. Here's another good one.|T
1100025|CC|Okay, we got that one.|T
1100031|CDR|Okay. Now, this one is right down-sun, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.|T
1100042|CC|Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.|T
1100053|CDR|All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.|T
1100117|CC|Roger.|T
1100127|LMP|Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and a bag deployed.|T
1100134|CC|We've got this view, Neil.|T
1100143|CDR|This is straight south.|T
1100147|CC|Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.|T
1100149|CDR|Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and then probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.|T
1100222|CC|Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.|T
1100224|CDR|How's that for a final?|T
1100226|CC|For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees. Over.|T

You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface, when in fact it really isn't.|T
1100444|CDR|I noticed in the soft spots where we have footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a - will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees along side of the footprints.|T

1100630|CDR|Okay.|T
1100631|LMP|Yes. I think that's the next one.|T

1100915|CMP|Great.|T
1100920|CC|I guess you're about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of the scene.|T
1100927|CMP|That's alright. I don't mind a bit.|T
1100934|CMP|How is the quality of the TV?|T
1100936|CC|Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is.|T
1100941|CMP|Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting half way decent?|T
1100944|CC|Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on the lunar surface.|T
1100952|CMP|Beautiful. Just beautiful.|T
1101017|CDR|That's good. See if you can pull that end off a little bit. Take that end up a little.|T

1101233|CC|Roger, Buzz.|T
1101317|LMP|I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person can ... traveling on the lunar surface. I believe I'm out of your field of view. Is that right, now, Houston?|T
1101330|CC|That's affirmative, Buzz.|T
1101339|CC|You are in our field of view now.|T
1101343|LMP|Alright. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.|T
1101407|LMP|In about two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. ... change directions, like a football player, you just have to to ... foot out to the side and cut a little bit.|T
1101441|LMP|So called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.|T
1101507|LMP|It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred ... but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity force here.|T
1101548|CC|Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please?|T
1101601|LMP|Say again, Houston.|T
1101602|CC|Roger. We'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.|T
1101611|CC|Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.|T

1101626|CC|Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.|T
1101630|PRESIDENT NIXON|Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|T
1101745|CDR|Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity and with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.|T
1101812|PRESIDENT NIXON|And thank you very much and I look forward - All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.|T
1101822|LMP|I look forward to that very much, sir.|T

1101956|CC|Roger. Out.|T
1102007|LMP|Houston, it's very interesting to note that when I kick my foot ... with no atmosphere here, and this gravity ... they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity. From where I stand, a large portion of them will impact at a certain distance out. Several ... the percentage is, of course, that will impact ... different regions ... it's highly dependent upon ... the initial trajectory upward ... where most of the ... already the particles are found, ... terrain.|T
1102109|CC|Roger, Buzz. And break. Break. Columbia, this is Houston. When you track out of high-gain antenna, then let's request OMNI Delta, OMNI Delta. Over.|T
1102121|CMP|So be it.|T
1102126|LMP|I've noticed several times in going from the sunlight into the shadow, that just as I go in, I catch an additional reflection off the LM ... along with the reflection off my face onto the visor, makes visibility very poor just at the transition ... sunlight into the shadow. I essentially have so much glare coming onto my visor ... shadow ... helmet actually gets the shadow. Than it takes a short while for my eyes to adapt to the lighting conditions. ... inside the shadow area, visibility, as we've said before, is not too great, but both visor's up ... what sort of footprints we have and the general condition of the soil. Then, after being out in the sunlight a while, it takes - Watch it, Neil! Neil, you're on the cable.|T
1102241|CDR|Okay.|T
1102241|LMP|Yes. Lift up your right foot, right foot. It's still - your toe is still hooked in it.|T
1102247|CDR|That one?|T
1102247|LMP|Yes. It's still hooked in it. Wait a minute. Okay. You're clear now.|T
1102252|CDR|Thank you.|T
1102256|LMP|Now, let's move that over this way.|T
1102301|PAO|Neil Armstrong has the scoop for the bulk sample collection.|P
1102305|LMP|Okay. I've got it.|T
1102333|LMP|The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this ... still don't know exactly what color to describe this other than greyish cocoa color. It seems to be covering most of the lighter part of the boot ... color that ... very fine particles ...|T
1102413|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. You're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. Can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? Over.|T
1102424|LMP|Roger. I'll try that.|T
1102426|CC|Beautiful.|T
1102431|LMP|Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.|T
1102436|CC|It sounded a little wet.|T
1102450|PAO|Neil's been on the surface a hour now. Buzz not quite twenty minutes less than that.|P
1102510|LMP|In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any ... thermal effects. ... feel inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.|T
1102541|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Over.|T
1102559|PAO|One hour and a half expended on the PLSS's now.|P

1102706|CC|Roger. You should have VHF AOS with the LM right about now. VHF LOS will be about 40 minutes 15 seconds. Over.|T
1102721|CMP|Thank you.|T
1102759|PAO|Heart rates on both crewmen averaging between 90 and 100. Flight surgeon reports they're right on the predicted number of the BTU units expended in energy of work. And he thinks they're in great shape.|P
1102823|LMP|As I look around the area, the contrast, in general, is ... comes about completely by virtue of the shadows ... down Sun ... very light colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own shadow, around the shadow of my helmet. Then, as I look off cross-sun, the contrast becomes strongest in that the surrounding color is still fairly light. As you look down into the Sun ... a larger amount of ... shadowed area is looking toward us. The general color of the ... surrounding ... the contrast is not as great. Surveying the - all the dusty area that we've kicked up ... considerably darker in texture. Now, I've kicked up one, and I imagine that this has been ... by a certain ... Surveyor. The same is true when I survey cross-sun along the area that we've been walking. In general, in addition to the fact that there are footprints there. General terrain where I've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast ... color.|T

1103131|LMP|The panorama I'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ...|T
1103140|CC|Say again which strut, Buzz?|T
1103145|LMP|The plus Z strut.|T
1103147|CC|Roger.|T
1103148|LMP|And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet across. There's several rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.|T
1103230|PAO|Neil is filling the bulk sample bag attached to a scale. You can see him in the picture. Buzz is behind the LM at the minus Z strut. That's the landing gear directly opposite the ladder.|P
1103249|PAO|Neil's been on the surface about an hour and 10 minutes now.|P
1103414|LMP|I'm now in the area of the minus Y strut taking some ... photographs.|T
1103457|PAO|Buzz is making his way around the LM photographing it from various angles, looking at its condition on all sides. Neil still occupied with the bulk sample. 1 hour 40 minutes time expended on the PLSS's now.|P

1103726|CC|Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.|T
1103729|CMP|Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest rim of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a - at quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.|T
1103759|CC|Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -|T
1103828|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111:19:31; AOS, 112:05:43. Over.|T
1103904|CC|Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.|T
1103915|CMP|Negative, Houston. You broke. Disregard. I'll get them off the Flight Plans.|T
1103920|CC|Roger. Out.|T
1103957|LMP|The ... deflector that's mounted on quad 1 seems to be a good bit more wrinkled ... right now on quad 4.|T
1104013|CC|You're breaking up again, Buzz.|T
1104019|LMP|I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems to be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the ... get some pictures in the aft part of the LM. The sun illuminates the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.|T
1104055|CC|Roger. Out.|T
1104059|LMP|We're going to get some particular photographs of the bulk sample area, Neil?|T
1104108|CDR|Okay.|T
1104127|LMP|And, Houston, Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming ... fingered.|T

1104215|CC|Houston. Roger. Out.|T
1104232|PAO|Neil has finished collecting and packing the bulk sample.|P
1104240|CC|Buzz, this is Houston. Have you removed the closeup camera from the MESA yet? Over.|T
1104252|LMP|Negative. Thank you.|T
1104319|LMP|... get the panorama up there.|T
1104321|CDR|Okay.|T
1104333|CDR|Got it?|T
1104334|LMP|Got it?|T
1104352|CDR|Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?|T
1104356|CC|Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.|T
1104405|CDR|Alright.|T
1104446|CC|Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.|T
1104504|LMP|Roger. I understand that.|T
1104626|PAO|Neil's been on the surface now slightly over an hour and 20 minutes.|P
1104638|CDR|Okay. I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Antennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.|T
1104718|CC|Roger. Out.|T
1104718|LMP|It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?|T
1104737|CDR|At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.|T
1104756|CMP|Sounds like a great job.|T
1104805|LMP|I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.|T
1104850|LMP|This one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a slight darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. You know, on descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to verify that.|T
1105028|LMP|This is too big an angle, Neil.|T
1105035|CDR|Yes. I think you are right.|T
1105131|LMP|We're back at the minus Z strut now. ... very little force of impact that we actually had.|T
1105201|LMP|And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.|T
1105206|CDR|Okay.|T
1105207|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -|T
1105217|CC|Go ahead, Buzz.|T
1105222|LMP|Try to get some close up pictures of that rock.|T
1105229|LMP|I was saying that, Houston, ... stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ...|T
1105248|CC|Roger.|T
1105255|LMP|Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?|T
1105301|CC|Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.|T
1105309|LMP|Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -|T
1105314|CC|Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.|T
1105327|PAO|The SEQ Bay contains the scientific experiments to be left on the surface of the Moon; the laser reflector.|P
1105339|LMP|All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.|T
1105346|CC|Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high-gain antenna, REACQ mode pitch 20, yaw 135. Over.|T
1105404|LMP|You want to pick an area, Neil?|T
1105406|CC|Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high-gain.|T
1105415|CMP|Columbia is locked up on the high-gain, Houston.|T

1105744|CC|Roger.|T
1105750|LMP|Okay. Have you got us a good area picked out?|T
1105754|CDR|Well, I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.|T

1105845|CDR|About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -|T
1105850|LMP|Well, it's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.|T
1105856|CDR|The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?|T
1105904|LMP|Should I put the LR cubed right about here?|T
1105908|CDR|All right. ...|T
1105912|LMP|I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.|T
1105920|CDR|I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?|T
1105926|LMP|I think this right here is just as level.|T
1105941|PAO|And, they will be out of the cameras field of view while setting up these experiments.|P
1110002|CDR|These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think it's small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - BB shot has hit the surface.|T
1110209|LMP|Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the BB to go in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ...|T
1110235|CC|You're cutting out again, Buzz.|T
1110250|LMP|Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.|T

1110432|CDR|I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.|T
1110439|LMP|That BB likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.|T
1110449|CDR|That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.|T
1110454|LMP|I think you're right.|T
1110457|CDR|Believe it is.|T
1110458|LMP|Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the BB is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.|T
1110520|CC|Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.|T

1131225|CMP|Roger. I'm copying.|T
1131227|CC|Secondly, we will return to the nominal timeline with your scheduled wakeup of 121 hours and 12 minutes. We sort of slipped by lithium hydroxide canister change number 9 during the EVA and EVA PREP. We'd like you to accomplish that now. The COMM for sleep will be the normal lunar COMM configuration, the RCS configuration. We're requesting you use quads Alfa and Bravo. A DAP data load for R2 should be 01111. Readback. Over.|T
1131328|CMP|Roger. Oxygen fuel cell purge at 113:30. Return to the nominal timeline at 121 hours wakeup. Lithium hydroxide change number 9 right now. Normal lunar COMM sleep configuration, I'm in that now. On the RCS, I understood before you wanted to load the DAP register to 01100 which made sense on panel 8 to pitch only on quad A, enable all on quad B, and C and D off. But you don't want to do that any more, huh?|T

Two things: we request that you select 10 degrees deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9-7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.|T

1142817|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1142820|CC|Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.|T
1142904|LMP|Okay. We'll try it.|T

1143233|CC|Roger. Out.|T
1143307|CC|Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.|T
1143336|CDR|I guess we can take them up now.|T
1143340|CC|Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.|T
1143353|CC|Tranquility - -|T
1143355|CDR|Okay. Thank you, Bruce. ... Go ahead.|T
1143400|CC|Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight Plan. Over.|T
1143417|CDR|We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.|T
1143432|CC|Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.|T
1143502|CDR|I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.|T
1143523|CC|Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.|T
1143538|CDR|We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.|T
1143607|CC|Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.|T
1143642|CDR|We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of a big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.|T
1143710|CC|Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.|T
1143744|LMP|The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.|T
1143825|CC|Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?|T
1143850|LMP|No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.|T
1143949|CC|Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -|T
1144003|LMP|I believe so.|T
1144004|CC|Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.|T
1144020|LMP|I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.|T
1144108|CC|Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you've collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over|T
1144128|LMP|Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.|T
1144226|CC|Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?|T
1144302|LMP|Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.|T
1144326|CC|Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.|T
1144403|CDR|Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?|T
1144409|CC|Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.|T
1144432|CDR|Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?|T
1144453|CC|Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar array during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the array? Over.|T
1144534|LMP|No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - it's about as level as any other areas that we chose.|T
1144547|CC|Roger. I - -|T
1144549|LMP|There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.|T
1144551|CC|Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 - 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.|T
1144626|CDR|I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.|T
1144647|CC|Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.|T
1144658|CDR|That's correct.|T
1144700|CC|Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.|T

All systems on the Lunar Module are in good order, showing cabin pressure of 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin temperature 62 degrees Fahrenheit. We have not heard from Tranquility Base since saying good night and we have not attempted to call them. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1165008|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 116 hours 50 minutes. All systems in both Columbia and Tranquility Base still operating very well. No problems. Dr. Kenneth Biers' report is the same as the one an hour ago. The data from Neil Armstrong indicates that he is resting, but he is not believed to be asleep, not following the pattern of sleep, but he is resting. Cabin pressure is holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch, temperature at 62 degrees Fahrenheit. The consumables in Tranquility Base are still in good shape, showing 45 and a half percent of the descent water still remaining, the water very important for cooling on the lunar surface. Showing 63 per cent of the oxygen supply in the Descent Stage still remaining. Both of those consumables in the Ascent Stage very high - have not been used yet. Two water tanks in the Ascent Stage, each one showing 97.6 percent; the other showing 98.4. Two oxygen tanks in the Ascent Stage, one reading 93 and a half per cent, the other 96.8 per cent. Mike Collins still asleep in Columbia. At 116 hours 52 minutes, all still going well with both spacecrafts. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P

1175410|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 117 hours 54 minutes. All continues to go well with both Columbia orbiting the Moon, now in its 22nd revolution, and Tranquility Base on the surface of the Moon. Flight surgeon Dr. Kenneth Biers says his data continues to indicate that Neil Armstrong may be dozing but he's sure that he is not sleeping soundly or well. Heart rates have been down in the 50's at times, but have not stayed there very long. He believes he may be sleeping fitfully and dozing, but stirring around quite a bit. Mike Collins still sleeping in Columbia and the Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin is not instrumented so the doctors cannot determine whether he's asleep or not. Cabin pressure in the Lunar Module still holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch. Temperature has dropped one degree since last report, now reading 61 degrees Fahrenheit. All consumables are still in good shape. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1185012|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 118 hours 50 minutes. Flight Controllers here in Mission Control Center continue to monitor the systems of Eagle at Tranquility Base constantly, and of Columbia when that spacecraft is within acquisition on the front side of the Moon. And they are in acquisition of Columbia telemetry now, it's in it's 22 revolution. Everything continuing to go very well. All systems normal. Mike Collins is still alseep, very well, in Columbia. Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully, if indeed he is asleep at all at Tranquility Base. Throughout this rest period the cabin pressure has held very steady at 4.9 in the Lunar Module. We're still showing a cabin temperature of 61. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P

1195104|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 119 hours, 51 minutes. The report is the same as it has been throughout the rest periods. All systems in both Eagle and Columbia are operating very well, Mike Collins asleep, Neil Armstrong sleeping fitfully. The heartrate goes down into the sleep range but then comes up out of it indicating he is stirring around considerably. Columbia is in its 23rd revolution, now in an orbit 62 by 57 nautical miles. Still holding 4.9 pounds per square inch cabin pressure, 61 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. The descent water quantity now shows 39 and one-half percent remaining. Descent oxygen quantity 63 percent remaining. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1205842|PAO|This is Apollo Control 120 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've called the spacecraft Columbia from Mission Control here to wake up Mike Collins. The network is configured so that the LM crew, the Eagle crew, will not be disturbed. Lets join the conversation in progress.|P
1205908|CC|Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.|T
1205916|CMP|Good morning, Ron.|T
1205918|CC|Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?|T
1205921|CMP|How goes it?|T
1205922|CC|Hey, real fine. While you're - -|T
1205924|CMP|I don't know yet, how's it going with you?|T
1205925|CC|Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.|T
1210001|CC|Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.|T
1210032|CMP|Okay.|T
1210037|CC|And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.|T
1210058|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1210059|CC|Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.|T
1210207|CC|Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.|T
1210216|CMP|Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.|T
1210227|CC|Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.|T
1210235|CMP|I'd like its grid square, please.|T
1210238|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
1210502|CC|Columbia, Houston.|T
1210512|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1210513|CC|Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the lat/long of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.|T
1210530|CMP|Okay. Ready to copy.|T
1210531|CC|Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?|T
1210601|CMP|Yes, please.|T
1210602|CC|Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.|T
1210636|CMP|Copy T1: 122:16:05. T2: 122:21:11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.|T
1210655|CC|Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.|T
1210708|CMP|All right.|T
1210709|CC|And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.|T
1210726|CMP|Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?|T
1210741|CC|Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -|T
1210754|CMP|Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for the LM.|T
1210757|CC|Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.|T
1210803|CMP|All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.|T
1210808|CC|And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.|T
1210818|CMP|Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?|T
1210838|CC|Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.|T
1210848|CMP|Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?|T
1210851|CC|Roger.|T
1210856|CC|And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.|T
1210903|CMP|Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.|T
1210906|CC|Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.|T
1210915|CMP|Thanks, Ron.|T

1211047|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft Columbia has gone behind the Moon on the 23rd lunar revolution. Be acquired again at - well, let's see now, it looks like we don't have acquisition table up yet for next rev. During this pass and the short conversation toward the end of the frontside pass with Columbia, the network transmitters have been arranged so that the transmissions would not disturb the crew of Eagle who at this time should still be asleep. Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins is experiencing during the 47 minutes of each lunar revolution when he's behind the Moon with no one to talk to except his tape recorder aboard Columbia. While he waits for his comrades to soar with Eagle from Tranquility Base and rejoin him for the trip back to Earth, Collins, with the help of Flight Controllers here in Mission Control Center has kept the Command Module's system going "pocketa-pocketapocketa". At 120 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
1214040|CC|Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.|T
1214049|LMP|Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.|T
1214050|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Let's join the call to Tranquility Base.|P
1214052|CC|Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?|T
1214106|LMP|Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.|T
1214117|CC|Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the Command Module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms that you were getting during descent.|T
1214208|LMP|Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.|T
1214217|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.|T
1214224|LMP|Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.|T
1214236|CC|Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes here if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.|T
1214302|LMP|All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.|T
1214304|CC|Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.|T
1214326|LMP|Now you've got P00 and DATA.|T
1214328|CC|Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.|T
1214338|LMP|Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.|T
1214347|CC|That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.|T
1214425|LMP|Roger. Understand that's 122:15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&N dictionary.|T
1214432|CC|Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.|T
1214454|LMP|Okay.|T
1214455|CC|Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE OVERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.|T
1214605|LMP|Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?|T
1214623|CC|Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.|T
1214657|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?|T
1214705|LMP|Roger. I have those two.|T
1214707|CC|Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.|T
1214740|LMP|Roger. Go ahead there.|T
1214741|CC|Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.|T
1214825|LMP|Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.|T
1214833|CC|Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.|T
1214914|LMP|Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.|T
1214915|CC|Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over.|T
1214951|LMP|Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.|T
1215005|CC|Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.|T
1215038|LMP|Okay. We'll put it in AGS.|T
1215043|CC|Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.|T
1215053|CC|Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.|T
1215111|LMP|Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.|T
1215115|CC|Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the "no update" mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.|T
1215232|LMP|Roger. I think I have that.|T
1215403|PAO|This is Apollo Control. A little over 2 minutes until Columbia comes over the hill again on the 24th Lunar Revolution. In that wake up call to Eagle, the crew described how they slept in the spacecraft by lying on the floor and on the engine cover. Some of the preliminary times being generated now ascent show ignition about 1 minute 26 seconds earlier than the pre-mission Flight Plan. Ignition time now showing 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds. Burn will have a magnitude of 6,068 feet per second. Quite a bit of that will be in vertical rise and actually starting from zero feet per second on the lunar surface. The CSI maneuver behind the Moon, the Concentric Sequence Initiate, CSI the acronym being for that maneuver. 125 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds. Consistent Delta Height CDH 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds. Terminal Phase Initiation 126 hours 57 minutes 0 seconds, and Terminal Phase Finalization or the final breaking before docking 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. These are Ground computations. And they will be computed by the crew from radar tracking, rendezvous radar. So actually these number computed on the Ground are somewhat academic in that they will be computed in real time by the crew. We're standing by here for Capcom to resume conversation. During this upcoming pass here, more definite fix on the Eagle positions will be attempted by using the rendezvous radar from the Eagle in Program 22, rendezvous radar lunar surface navigation program. The transponder on Columbia in the meantime has been warmed up. During the last revolution, Mike Collins was advised to - have the - the transponder warmed up. As of now, the exact location is somewhat vague. And perhaps this rendezvous radar exercise will give a final, more pinpoint location of where Eagle does indeed nest on the Moon. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit. We've had acquisition of signal with Columbia, so likely the conversation will increase here as we get the - the lockon, hopefully, with rendezvous radar as Columbia passes over the Eagle landing site. Still live on air-ground.|P

1222053|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger.|T
1222107|LMP|On second thought, since that will peg the range rate, I guess maybe we'd better not do that. And for this range that the AGS are showing now, 425 miles with a signal strength of 2.2. It looks like we ought to proceed on this. Over.|T

1230816|CDR|We had a lot of help down there, Jim.|T
1230929|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal with Columbia going behind the Moon. Toward the end of that pass, Apollo 11 backup commander, Jim Lovell, who's had some experience in Lunar missions came up with his congratulations for a job-well-done. He mentioned that he would be here giving moral support during the rendezvous sequence to follow. There will likely to be further communications with Eagle until the Command Module comes around the corner again some 44 minutes from now We'll bring the circuit back up as communications resume perhaps playing catch up with tape recordings, and at 123 hours, 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, 1 hour, 11 minutes to ignition, this is Apollo - stand by. We may be - let's listen in again.|P
1231033|CDR|And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.|T
1231258|CC|Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.|T
1231309|CDR|I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged blocky-rimmed crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this blocky-rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.|T
1231420|CC|Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.|T
1231436|CC|And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S-band function switch to OFF RESET.|T

1231448|CC|And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.|T
1231457|LMP|Roger. Ready to copy.|T
1231459|CC|Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O2 is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.|T

1231844|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1231846|CC|Roger. For your P57 here, we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.|T
1231912|LMP|Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.|T
1231941|CC|Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.|T
1232047|CC|Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.|T

1232103|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
1232107|LMP|And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.|T

1232256|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1232257|CC|Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.|T
1232314|LMP|Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?|T
1232317|CC|Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the stars there.|T
1232339|LMP|On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.|T
1232347|CC|Roger. That's fine then.|T
1232438|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 57 minutes 22 seconds away from ignition on the LM ascent back into lunar orbit. Some 30 minutes away from acquisition of the spacecraft Columbia, as it comes around again on the 25th revolution. And the latest information from the scientific experiment placed on the lunar surface last night by the Apollo 11 crew, our Science Support Room reports receiving continuous data from the Passive Seismic Experiment. The Passive Seismic Experiment, part of the Early Apollo Science Experiment Package which has the acronym EASEP. Recorded the astronauts footsteps on the Moon; also sent down signals when the crew climbed up the ladder back into the Eagle, and recorded a strong signal when they expended Portable Life Support backpacks and other pieces of equipment were jettisoned out Eagle's front hatch.

1232603|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1232605|CC|Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.|T
1232629|LMP|Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.|T
1232632|CC|Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on liftoff, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after liftoff. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.|T
1232655|LMP|Roger. Copy.|T
1232713|LMP|Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.|T
1232728|CC|Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.|T
1232828|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in Mission Control Center Flight Director, Glynn Lunney is polling the various positions here in the Control Room on their readiness to go ahead with the ascent from this next pass as the Command Module comes around the Moon, and we're some 53 minutes now away from ascent. Meanwhile back at the scientific experiment situation, another attempt is scheduled today to shoot another laser beam up to the laser retro-reflector, which is the other part of the experiment package left on the Moon. The seismic experiment will continue to record and send back measurements to Mission Control and will probably receive it's strongest signal when the ascent engine ignites and starts Eagle on it's way into lunar orbit and rendezvous with Columbia. There's considerable amount of conversation going on with the crew even though Command Module Columbia is behind the Moon at this time. Rather than disconnect the air-ground line and be in a tape playback mode, we'll leave a circuit up all the way through to loss of signal on the next rev when both spacecraft will go behind the Moon. At 123 hours, 29 minutes, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.|P

1240635|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Network controller just informed the Flight Director that items called battle shorts have been installed around the network. These are mechanical shorts of critical power supplies and transmitters and the like, so that before they will go off-line, they'll actually burn up in critical phases of the mission. They want to get as much data as possible through the burn, so for that reason any circuit breaking function of the equipment is inhibited with these battle shorts. They're not a piece of apparel. In the upcoming ascent some 14 minutes from now, almost 5000 pounds of propellant will be run through the ascent engine to propel the Lunar Module upper stage - ascent stage to velocity - total velocity of 6068 feet per second. Go through a vertical rise phase at about 50 seconds after liftover - liftoff will begin pitching over, and some 168 miles down range will be inserted into lunar orbit at about 60,000 feet above the surface. With an apolune of approximately 45 nautical miles half a revolution later on the far side of the Moon. We will continue to monitor air-ground here.

1250821|CDR|Okay, thank you.|O
1250840|CDR|Okay.|O
1250858|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal with Eagle. Quite scratchy as Eagle went over the hill to complete the 25th lunar revolution as it gets to the midpoint on the lunar far side. Ascent burn just completed went quite well on time at 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds ground elapsed time. Coming up on this rev, approximately 10 minutes from now as a matter of fact, will be the concentric sequence initiate maneuver, CSI, which will raise the Eagle's perilune to some 45 nautical miles. Eagle now is in an orbit measuring 9.4 nautical miles at insertion or perilune, and 46.7 at apolune, This CSI maneuver will be made approximately at apolune. Therefore, the effect takes place 180 degrees later and has the effect of raising perilune to the desired 45 nautical miles. This maneuver will take place at 125 hours 19 minutes 34.7 seconds. He will have a DELTA-V or velocity change of 51.5 feet per second. All of these maneuvers, incidentally, in the rendezvous sequence by Eagle will be made by using the Reaction Control System of Eagle. Following the CSI at 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds a 9.2 foot per second burn, probably mostly a radial burn, at 126 hours 18 minutes will twist the Eagle's orbit to equal distance from the orbit of Columbia, what they call a constant DELTA height, or CDH maneuver. At 126 hours 57 minutes 00 seconds, terminal phase initiation, TPI. In this maneuver the crew visually thrusts along the line of sight toward Columbia when the line of sight is some 27 degrees above the local horizontal. This maneuver will have a magnitude of about 24.9 feet per second, and, in turn, it raises the apolune to 60.5 nautical miles, which is approximately the altitude Columbia's orbiting. Terminal phase finalization. TPF 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. This is the start time for a series of small burns which are a combination of mid-course corrections and velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle in with Columbia and match the velocity so that they station-keep for a short period for photography, etc., and move on in to docking at approximately 128 hours ground elapsed time. In all of these maneuvers Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver approximately a minute after the Eagle is scheduled to make its maneuver, and if for some reason Eagle can not make the maneuver, Collins would do the exact same maneuver only in reverse so that Columbia would in effect begin a CSM active rendezvous with Eagle. As Eagle went over the hill on the 25th revolution, a velocity was being measured at 5410 feet per second. Eagle's weight somewhat lighter than when it started out in excess of 32,000 pounds, it's now shrunk to some 5885 pounds. Some 39 minutes 20 seconds away from acquisition of Columbia. 41 minutes 45 seconds from acquisition of Eagle as the 2 vehicles come around on the 26th revolution. The crew will likely describe how the CSI burn went, which is some 5 minutes away from this point, and at 125 hours 14 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.|P

1281137|CMP|Roger. I'm configured now at ... for BD roll, and I have thrusters C4 and B3 turned off, and I copy register 1 61102 01111 and LM weight 5785. Thank you.|T
1281154|CC|Roger, Columbia.|T
1281359|CMP|Houston, Columbia has completed the leak check, and proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.|T
1281409|CC|Roger, Columbia. Understand you're doing the leak check. I missed anything after that.|T
1281415|CMP|I say the leak check is complete, and I'm proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.|T
1281425|CC|Eagle - or, Columbia, Roger.|T
1282005|CMP|Eagle, Columbia.|T
1282009|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1282010|CMP|My hatch is removed. You can open yours, and I'll start passing stuff up to you.|T
1282014|CDR|Okay.|T
1282024|CMP|No. Stand by one, first.|T
1282029|CDR|Okay.|T
1282422|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still rather noisy communications here on the 27th lunar revolution. 39 minutes remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon. We'll leave the circuit up and try to monitor the conversation between the two spacecraft or between the Apollo 11 and the ground for the remainder of this pass - try to ascertain the status onboard as far as transferring the crew and other items back into the Command Module. The cleanup in the LM getting all the items dusted off prior to bringing them back into the Command Module. At 128 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, standing by, this is Apollo Control.|P
1282832|LMP|Mike, you still there?|T
1282834|CMP|Yes, everything is going fine. Be with you in just a second.|T
1283012|CC|Eagle, Houston. Over.|T
1283018|LMP|Go ahead, Houston, Eagle here.|T
1283019|CC|Roger. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30,000. Over.|T
1283036|LMP|Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?|T
1283049|LMP|No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.|T
1283100|CC|Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the Command Module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.|T
1283126|LMP|Roger.|T
1283207|CC|Eagle, Houston.|T
1283212|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1283213|CC|Roger. All we are trying to do is get PGNS and AGS aligned together. Doesn't make any difference on the gimbal angle.|T
1283230|CMP|Okedey ...|T
1283236|LMP|Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?|T
1283240|CC|Eagle, that's beautiful.|T
1283246|LMP|Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.|T
1283258|CC|Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.|T
1283310|LMP|Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You just tell me a little later if you need some help.|T
1283324|CC|Eagle, Houston. That's fine.|T
1283633|CMP|Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high-gain or anything like that?|T
1283640|CC|Columbia, Houston. I can give you some REACQ angles for the high-gain on the LM jettison attitude. Then you can go there whenever you want to. The angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero.|T
1283704|CMP|Okay.|T
1283809|CMP|Houston, Columbia. Say again the jettison roll, pitch, and yaw, please.|T
1283824|CC|Columbia, Houston. Roll zero, pitch 025, and yaw zero. Over.|T
1283838|CMP|Roger. Understand roll zero, pitch 025, yaw zero.|T
1283842|CC|Affirmative.|T
1283914|CMP|... in progress. We've moving. Houston.|T
1284011|LMP|Houston, Eagle. Over.|T
1284014|CC|Eagle, Houston. Go.|T
1284020|LMP|Roger. It doesn't appear as though the red hose is going to be much of a competitor to the leading vacuum cleaner brands. Over.|T
1284029|CC|There's a little noise there, Buzz. Say again.|T
1284156|CC|Eagle, Houston.|T
1284204|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1284206|CC|Roger. Just a reminder to be sure to zero the AGS errors before you enable the AGS attitude hold there after you get in burn attitude.|T
1284228|LMP|Roger. You mean SEP attitude?|T
1284249|CMP|Houston, how do you read Columbia on high-gain now?|T
1284252|CC|Hey, Columbia. Houston. Mighty fine; loud and clear.|T
1284258|CMP|Same here, Ron. Thanks.|T
1284303|CC|And Eagle, Houston. Your steerable antenna angles for jettison attitude are - Over.|T
1284324|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1284325|CC|Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68. Over.|T
1284336|LMP|Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68.|T
1284340|CC|Eagle, Houston. Correct.|T
1284509|CC|Columbia, Houston.|T
1284515|CMP|Columbia. Go ahead.|T
1284516|CC|Roger, Mike. You want to tweak the O2 flow up just a bit there?|T
1284524|CMP|Okay. Coming up. Houston, do you have any preference as to what you want us to do with the probe? Over.|T
1284538|CC|Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.|T
1284545|CMP|Okay. Eagle says they've got a place for it inside there, so no problem.|T
1284550|CC|Roger. That's all we were assuming.|T
1284651|CC|Eagle, Houston.|T
1284708|CDR|Eagle. Go ahead.|T
1284709|CC|Roger. Neil, it looks like your steerable's good. You can put your track mode to slew and high bit rate, please. Over.|T
1284721|CDR|Okay. Track mode to slew and high bit rate.|T
1284750|CMP|Okay. Stand by just one, please.|T
1284826|CMP|Okay. Shoot them on down.|T
1284929|CC|Eagle, Houston.|T
1284937|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1284938|CC|Roger. Neil, just a reminder again, the ACA out of detent to zero; the AGS out of there just in case you go to ATTITUDE HOLD shortly.|T
1284949|CDR|Okay.|T
1285021|CMP|You say you wanted the probe now?|T
1285348|CC|Eagle, Houston.|T
1285355|CDR|Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.|T
1285356|CC|Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS errors. Over.|T
1285414|CDR|Say again, please.|T
1285415|CC|Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.|T
1285425|CDR|Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.|T
1285430|CC|That's okay. That's good.|T
1285441|LMP|And I thought I'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if I could get 000 gone, since we're fairly close to gimbal lock right now.|T
1285458|CC|Eagle, Houston. That's fine.|T
1285643|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Some 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining until Apollo 11 goes behind the Moon on the 27th revolution. The signal from the passive seismometer, which was left on the Moon by the crew of Eagle, was lost for 30 minutes beginning about 5 minutes before Eagle took off this morning. The signal was lost because of a equipment problem that the Canary Island tracking station. The Seismic equipment is back on line now, and is beginning to record lunar day surface temperatures. The dust detector recorded zero dust after Eagle lift-off. The laser ground station have not yet acquired a return signal from the Laser Ranging Retro Reflector. Five minutes away from loss of signal with Apollo 11. We will continue to monitor the air-to-ground as the spacecraft goes over the hill. The crew now is engaged in the decontamination procedures inside the Lunar Module prior to transferring back into the Command Module.|P
1285805|CC|Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jett time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.|T
1285827|CMP|Stand by one.|T
1285845|CMP|Could you read it around the next time around, please?|T
1285848|CC|Sure, Mike. That's fine. We'll get it to you then.|T
1290153|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. About a minute and a half to LOS. You're looking great. It's been a mighty fine day.|T
1290203|CMP|Boy, you're not kidding.|T
1290332|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 11 went around the back side of the Moon on the 27th rev. We'll have acquisition with Apollo 11 approximately 45 minutes from now. At - Let's see - Would you believe they don't have the next tables up for the next rev. At any rate, 45 minutes from now, and at 129 hours 4 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
1290408|LMP|Now, here are a couple of bags - and I think it's self-explanatory what goes in them.|O

1291326|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 129 hours, 13 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 36 minutes 40 seconds from coming around the other side of the Moon for reacquisition on the 28th revolution. We're nearing the end of the 27th revolution at this time. On the backside of the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin should be involved in preparing for transferring back to the Command Module with Mike Collins, and they'll be cleaning up equipment and vacuuming off any particles of dust that remain before transferring to the Command Module. About 15 minutes after we reacquire we would expect Neil Armstrong to be ready for the transfer to the Command Module. Buzz Aldrin to follow along behind about 30 or 40 minutes later. Here in Mission Control we're presently completing the shift change. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Glenn Lunney, and the Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke. The change-of-shift briefing is scheduled to occur in the news center at 6 p.m. Central Daylight Time. At 129 hours, 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

1291448|CMP|Yes.|O
1291450|LMP|Yes?|O
1291452|CMP|Yes, I guess I have; just a second.|O
1291453|CDR|You know, that - that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back – LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself; we'll have to figure something out for it.|O
1291516|LMP|Ouch! Alright, here's your checklist.|O
1291636|LMP|You vacuum all this stuff?|O

1291716|CDR|How about the data bag?|O
1291716|LMP|No, I need this bag.|O

1295105|CMP|Houston, this is Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. We're all three back inside; the hatch is installed. We're running a pressure integrity check. Everything's going well.|T
1295113|CC|Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch, here. We had a couple of things for you.|T
1295127|CMP|What are they?|T
1295128|CC|Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO2 sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all.|T
1295137|CC|Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.|T
1295156|CMP|Buzz says the CO2 sensor circuit breaker is IN|T
1295200|CC|Roger. Thank you very much.|T
1295211|CMP|The RCS quantity was approximately 60 at A and 45 percent at B.|T
1295216|CC|Roger.|T
1295221|CMP|And we're going P00 in ACCEPT.|T
1295223|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T
1295408|CC|Columbia, Houston. Your friendly White Team's going to be on till we get you on the way home, and we'd like to congratulate everybody on a successful rendezvous and a beautiful EVA. It was a great show for everybody. Over.|T
1295426|CMP|Thank you, sir. I'll tell Neil and Buzz.|T
1295445|CDR|Houston, the hatch passes its integrity check. I'm going to go to LM tunnel VENT now, and leave it there.|T
1295453|CC|Roger, Colualbia. We copy. That's good, and we'd like a readout on the GET of about the time you - that Eagle selected the secondary loop. Over.|T
1295507|CDR|Stand by.|T
1295518|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. We got the load in. You can do the VERB 66 and the computer is yours. Over.|T
1295526|CDR|Roger.|T
1295603|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. Over.|T
1295613|CC|Roger. Copy. Columbia. Thank you very much.|T
1295722|CC|Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.|T
1295743|CMP|That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.|T
1295751|CC|Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.|T
1295815|CMP|Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the Flight Plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.|T
1295822|CC|Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.|T
1295843|CC|Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 in ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.|T
1295858|CMP|Roger.|T
1300215|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.|T
1300221|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1300222|CC|Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.|T
1300248|CMP|Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.|T
1300250|CC|Roger.|T
1300435|CC|Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend picking up page F11 - 12 and we'd like to jettison at 10 minutes. That'll be 130:14:45. Over.|T
1300456|CMP|Right.|T
1300459|CC|Columbia, Houston. If that's not satisfactory, let us know. Over.|T
1300507|CMP|Right.|T
1300538|CDR|Houston, Columbia. How about a GO for logic BUS ARM.|T
1300541|CC|Stand by.|T
1300550|CC|Columbia, Houston. You've got a GO.|T
1300557|CDR|Thank you.|T
1300648|CC|Columbia, Houston. You can undock at your convenience, correction, jettison at your convenience. We would like you to jettison Eagle and stationkeep - in P47 and stationkeep, and we'll have another attitude and a maneuver for you so we'll be okay for TEI. Over.|T
1300710|CDR|Roger that.|T
1300747|CMP|Okay. I'm standing by to go to P47 just as soon as you give me a go for PYRO ARM.|T
1300751|CC|Roger. I thought we gave you that. Mike, you're GO for PYRO ARM and you're GO for jettison.|T
1300758|CMP|Okay.|T

1301007|CC|Roger, can you kind of stationkeep with it, Mike? Just stand by now.|T
1301014|CMP|Will do.|T
1301025|CC|Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.|T
1301034|LMP|Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?|T
1301037|CC|Say again, Buzz. Over.|T
1301039|CMP|Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?|T
1301055|CC|Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.|T
1301107|CMP|There she goes. It was a good one.|T
1301109|CC|Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.|T
1301121|LMP|I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.|T
1301136|CC|Roger.|T
1301245|CC|Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130:30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.|T
1301258|CMP|That's fine.|T
1301607|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 16 minutes. We reacquired Apollo 11 about 25 minutes ago, at 129:51. At that time Mike Collins reported that all 3 crewmen were in the Command Module. The transfer occurring while the spacecraft were on the back side of the Moon. They had closed out the LM early and had transferred to the second coolant loop. That decision was made in Mission Control because the secondary loop was on, the primary loop disabled in the close out process. We did not want to have the LM docked to the CSM for an undue length of time, because the primary guidance system is not cooled. The decision was initially made to jettison the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, however the crew continued ahead of schedule. They were ready to jettison ahead of that time, and Collins reported at 130 10 about, 17 minutes ago, that they were, had jettisoned the LM and said it had departed at several feet per second, and we heard a comment from Buzz Aldrin, that he noticed some cracks in the thermo covering around the LM tunnel, docking area, however he said it did not appear to be a structural crack but merely some cracks in the thermal covering. We are currently scheduled to perform the small Reaction Control System maneuver with the Command and Service Module for separation from the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, or about 12 minutes from now. We'll pick up this pass as it began on tape and when we've caught up, we'll continue to follow the activity live.|P
1301651|CC|Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.|T
1301703|CMP|Roger. Pitch 230.|T
1301705|CC|Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high-gain.|T
1301717|CMP|We're in REACQ. Is that all right?|T
1301719|CC|Say again. We need AUTO.|T
1301725|CMP|Negative, we're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.|T
1301727|CC|Roger. We need AUTO, please, sir.|T
1301732|CMP|Okay. You got it.|T
1301744|CMP|Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?|T
1301749|CC|Right now that's what we're looking at. Stand by. We might have you roll so we can keep the high-gain. Stand by.|T
1301757|CMP|Roger.|T
1301906|CC|Columbia, Houston. Over.|T
1301911|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1301912|CC|Roger, Mike - -|T
1301912|CDR|Apollo 11, these days.|T
1301914|CC|Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.|T
1301934|CMP|Okay.|T
1302057|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.|T
1302104|CMP|You got it.|T
1302105|CC|Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.|T
1302115|CMP|Go ahead. Ready to copy.|T
1302116|CC|Roger. Starting with Noun 33: 130:30:00.00, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. Noun 44 is NA. Delta-VT 00020, burn time 0:07, Delta-VC 00020. We have - the rest of the PAD is NA.|T
1302217|CMP|Roger. GET 130 hours, 30 minutes; Delta-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, Delta-VT 2.0.|T
1302233|CC|That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to right after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.|T
1302413|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.|T
1302421|CMP|Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?|T
1302440|CC|Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.|T
1302500|CMP|Understand.|T
1302552|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.|T
1302614|CMP|Okay.|T
1303027|CMP|Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.|T
1303039|CC|Copy, Apollo 11. Looks good to us. Over.|T
1303045|CMP|Okay.|T
1303326|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with a good communications attitude for us to go to between now and the time we maneuver to TEI attitude.|T
1303334|CC|Roger, sir. Stand by.|T
1303442|CC|Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.|T
1303447|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1303449|CC|Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the Flight Plan, and the high-gain angles are good as shown in the Flight Plan, and we'd like you to dump the wastewater at 131:05 down to 10 percent. Over.|T
1303514|CMP|Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a wastewater dump 10 percent starting at 131:05.|T
1303530|CC|That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.|T
1303713|CMP|Maneuver is in progress, Houston.|T
1303714|CC|Copy, 11. Out.|T
1304016|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
1304609|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 46 minutes. That Command Module separation maneuver, which occurred at 130 hours 30 minutes, was a 2 foot per second retrograde burn. Burn duration was 7 seconds. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that at transearth injection, which is scheduled to occur as per the Flight Plan, at about 135 hours 25 minutes, and at that time, the CSM will be about 20 miles ahead of the LM and about I mile below.|P
1304648|CMP|Apollo 11 under high-gain. How do you read?|T
1304651|CC|Five by, 11. How me? Over.|T
1304656|CMP|You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?|T
1304707|CC|That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.|T
1304727|CMP|That's what we're looking for.|T
1304729|CC|Roger.|T
1304741|CC|11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.|T
1304754|CMP|Thank you, Charlie.|T
1304758|CC|And your little maneuver back here a moment ago will put you about 20 miles ahead of the LM at TEI.|T
1304809|CMP|Okay.|T
1304843|CMP|Imagine that place has cleared out a little bit after that rendezvous. You can find a place to sit down almost, huh?|T
1304849|CC|Roger. Our MOCR's about empty right now. We're taking it a little easy. How does it feel up there to have some company?|T
1304859|CMP|Damn good, I'll tell you.|T
1304901|CC|I'll bet. I bet, you'd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 REVS or so.|T
1304909|CMP|No, no. It's a happy home here. It'd be nice to have company. As a matter of fact, it'd be nice to have a couple of hundred million Americans up here.|T
1304920|CC|Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit.|T
1304921|CMP|Let them see what they're getting for their money.|T
1304923|CC|Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many. We heard on the news today, 11, that last night after you - yesterday after you made your landing, New York Times came out with a - headlines, the largest headlines they've ever used in the history of the newspaper.|T
1304949|CMP|Save us a copy.|T
1304957|CDR|I'm glad to hear it was fit to print.|T
1305000|CC|It was great.|T
1305010|CC|That's why we didn't read you up any newscast today. There really wasn't anything to talk about.|T

1305137|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We've got 10 minutes to LOS; see you over the hill at 131:48. Over.|T
1305146|CMP|Okay, Charlie. I'll dump the water as soon as we go around the corner.|T
1305150|CC|Roger. Everything's looking real good now.|T
1305155|CMP|Yes. Same here.|T
1305709|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Coming up about 4:30 LOS. You're looking great on all your systems. Eagle is purring right along after an hour 30 without any cooling. The PNGS is still looking good. Over.|T
1305726|CMP|Roger.|T
1310028|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Will you verify that your rendezvous radar transponder is off? Over.|T
1310040|CMP|It's not, but I'll get it off.|T
1310042|CC|Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar, and that was the only theory that we had. It looked like it was a good one.|T
1310048|LMP|What do you do with it?|O
1310049|CC|- - and that was the only theory that we had - it looked like it was a good one.|O
1310052|LMP|Hey - what do you do with it?|O
1310054|CMP|Just turn it down to off.|O
1310056|CMP|Good theory.|T

1310135|CMP|You ought to check the Flight Plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue. It says I remove my hatch, and then I notify you that you're clear to open your hatch.|O
1310149|CMP|Huh?|O
1310158|LMP|Oh, no.|O
1310159|CMP|So, that's just the contingency.|O
1310203|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point or pericynthian of 54.9.

1310346|CMP|How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?|O
1310348|LMP|Well, there was a little - little blast – then we started moving; then we could see all those - -|O
1310356|CMP|... were you very stable; I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?|O
1310401|LMP|- - The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by ... - it was about - at lift-off - maybe - half a g or two-thirds of a g.|O
1310425|CMP|Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.|O

1310443|CMP|But it's pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn't really come up and engulf you, huh?|O

1314737|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 48 minutes. We're standing by to reacquire Apollo - Apollo 11. Acquisition should come in about 5 seconds. This revolution should be relatively quiet. We don't have a great deal of activity scheduled. The crew may have time to get something to eat, and here on the ground will be computing the information needed for their transearth injection burn. We do have data now from the spacecraft. We'll standby for a call to the crew.|P
1314744|CDR|You mean you didn't ...?|O
1314753|LMP|Getting all the damn alarms.|O
1314806|LMP|Boy, I thought for a while there that some of those might get a little ... - ... I'd reset the program alarm in time for a ... out of there.|O
1314931|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here. Over.|T
1314944|LMP|Apollo 11. Roger.|T
1315524|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We suspect the crew are having something to eat at this time which probably accounts for the relatively quiet period. One of the things that we are watching with interest here in Mission Control is the Lunar Module. At the time Aldrin and Armstrong left the LM and came back into the Service Module, they switched over to the secondary cooling loop as part of a test that we are running to determine just how long the primary guidance and navigation system will last without cooling. The primary guidance system is not cooled on the secondary loop which provides backup cooling for the secondary guidance system and it has always been a point of interest as to just how long the primary guidance system will survive without cooling - estimates range up to several hours. The LM TEL COMM Controller reports that at this time we are seeing some rise in the PIPAS. These are the Pulse Integrating Pendulum - Pendulous Accelerometers which - the primary guidance system uses to detect changes in motion and attitude and of course they are an essential item in the - the primary guidance system. We are seeing a gradual rise in temperature but the TEL COMM engineer reports that the primary guidance system still looks very good. At the time the crew reported they were back that Armstrong and Aldrin reported that they were back in the Command Module, we asked them what time they did switch over to the secondary loop. Armstrong estimated that that occurred about 129 hours 40 minutes which was a little over 2 hours ago. We will continue to monitor the LM and to observe the performance of the primary guidance system. All systems on the Command and Service Module continue to function very well at this time and the same can be said for the Lunar Module. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in a orbit 62.5 nautical miles by 54.2. The spacecraft traveling at a speed of 5,349 feet per second.|P
1321529|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 15 minutes. We have some preliminary figures on the transearth injection maneuver scheduled to occur about 3 hours, 8 minutes from now. The time of ignition is - stand by just a moment. The time of ignition would be 135 hours, 23 minutes 41 seconds.|P
1321602|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.|T
1321611|CDR|Be pleased to have it.|T
1321613|CC|Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister, Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times, which we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950,000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."|T
1321722|CC|And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24,000. That's pretty good odds.|T
1321800|CC|You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."|T
1321853|CC|In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm-damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.|T
1321922|CC|Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129,000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.|T

1322854|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 29 minutes. That last string of numbers read up to the spacecraft included the information the crew will need to start them on their way back to Earth in about 2 hours, 54 minutes. The time of ignition for the transearth injection burn again is 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. They will burn their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes, 28 seconds and increasing their speed by 3,283 feet per second. And our preliminary estimate is that that will put them into the Pacific Ocean at the primary landing site at 195 hours, 18 minutes, 47 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time, or almost precisely on the Flight Plan.|P
1323001|PAO|The spacecraft weight at the time they do the transearth injection burn will be 36,691 pounds. We'll continue to stand by for any communication from the spacecraft. We now have about 29 minutes, 30 seconds until the Apollo 11 goes around the corner and behind the Moon out of radio contact.|P

1325929|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now about 30 seconds from loss of signal with Apollo 11 on the 29th revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 46 minutes. As the spacecraft comes around on its 30th revolution, that will be the next to the last full revolution in lunar orbit. The transearth injection maneuver will be performed at the end of the 30th revolution, just after - actually, just after beginning the 31st revolution of the Moon. Apollo 11 is now in an orbit with a high point of 62.6 nautical miles and a low point of 54.2. The current spacecraft velocity is 5,356 feet per second, and we show an orbital weight of 36,691 pounds. We have loss of signal now. We'll be coming back up when we reacquire in about 45 minutes. At 133 hours, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

1335427|CMP|...|T
1335746|PAO|This is Apollo Control. At this time the crew should be involved in their pre-transearth injection status checks. They will also be aligning the platform on their spacecraft guidance system and will be passing up the final information for the transearth injection burn computed on the ground. A few minutes ago you heard Charlie Duke advise the crew that we show the LM platform is about to go. We've mentioned that prior to leaving the Lunar Module the crew had deactivated the primary coolant loop placing the secondary coolant loop in operation aboard the LM. This means that the primary guidance system does not get cooling. This is part of a preplanned test to find out just how long the primary guidance system would continue to function without cooling. We had predicted in advance that it would - may not - possibly not last much longer than a hour or so, but at the time Charlie Duke reported the platform had just gone down on the LM, it had been in operation without cooling a little more than four hours. We had an approximate time from the crew of transferring to the secondary coolant loop of about 129 hours 40 minutes and we got the report from Duke that the LM guidance platform was no longer usable at 133 hours 55 minutes. We'll continue to standby for any further conversation from the crew. We're now 1 hour 24 minutes, 10 seconds away from transearth injection which will occur on the backside of the Moon at the beginning of the 31st revolution.|P

1341009|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours, 10 minutes. We have about 47 minutes, 30 seconds before losing contact with Apollo 11 as it goes behind the Moon in preparation for the transearth injection burn. With the burn we would reacquire the spacecraft at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 11 seconds. Without the transearth injection burn on the upcoming revolution we would reacquire at 135 hours, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. The final figures on that burn as passed up to the crew a few minutes ago are as follows: ignition will occur at 135 hours, 23 minutes, 42 seconds. The burn duration will be 2 minutes, 28 seconds. And that will add 3284 feet per second to the spacecraft velocity starting it on its path back to Earth. And we would consume about 10,000 pounds of propellant with that burn. Splash would occur according to our preliminary figures, just about precisely as predicted in the Flight Plan. We'll continue to monitor now for any further conversation from the spacecraft.|P
1341655|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. After the burn, we'd like you to trim X and Z. Over.|T
1341707|CMP|Okay, Charlie.|T
1341708|CC|Roger. And that's to 0.2 foot per second, as shown in the Flight Plan.|T

1342034|CC|Thank you, sir.|T
1343153|PAO|This is Apollo control at 134 hours, 32 minutes. Flight Director, Gene Kranz just requested his Flight Controllers to view all of their data, take a good look at the spacecraft, and be prepared to make go, no go recommendations shortly for the transearth injection burn. That maneuver now 51 minutes, 27 seconds away. All systems on the spacecraft looking good at this point. The cabin temperature has been running about 72 degrees. At this time, the crew is aligning the platform on their guidance system. The stable platform used as a attitude reference for the upcoming burn. We've had very little conversation both here in the Control Center and from the spacecraft on this pass. We'll continue to stand by and monitor.|P

The Flight Controllers have been observing the crew inputs through their computer and monitoring as the crew prepares for the transearth injection burn, scheduled to occur in about 35 minutes from now. We have now 9 minutes 20 seconds until loss of signal. The spacecraft currently traveling at a speed of 5,329 feet per second and the altitude is 62.5 nautical miles. At the time of the transearth injection burn, the Lunar Module, Eagle, should be about 20 miles behind the Command Module.|P

1345017|PAO|The crew has a go for the trans Earth injection at the beginning of the 31 revolution. All systems on the spacecraft are looking very good at this point. You heard Capcom, Charlie Duke advise Mike Collins that we will reacquire the spacecraft on the other side of the Moon. Now with the burn the Ground Elapsed Time of 135 hours 34 minutes and 5 seconds. Without the burn we reacquire at 135 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds. We now have 6 minutes 50 seconds until loss of signal. We will continue to monitor.|P

We're now 15 seconds from the scheduled ignition time. That burn will last about 2 minutes 28 seconds and consume 10,000 pounds of propellant. The crew should be burning at this time. Of course, that maneuver is performed on the back side of the Moon. We have no data from the spacecraft here in Mission Control at this time. We won't know how the burn went for about another ten minutes, which is the time of which we're scheduled to reacquire Apollo 11. During the course of this burn the spacecraft will increase its speed by about 3280 feet per second, or about 2240 miles per hour.|P

1354301|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We now show the spacecraft traveling at 7,378 feet per second. Altitude 568 nautical miles. The next order of business will be to get the crew to sleep. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, requested his Flight Controllers, prior to acquisition of signal to review their procedures and to take as many steps as possible to get the crew to sleep as soon as possible. There will be a press conference in the building 1 auditorium. We estimate the time on that at about 12:30 Central Daylight Time.|P
1354416|PAO|And our LM telecommunications engineer reports that we've just had acquisition of signal from Eagle which is still in lunar orbit. The last fix that we had on Eagle's orbit showed an apogee of 64.1 and a para - apocynthion rather of 64.1 and a pericynthion of 64.4 nautical miles.|P

1355111|CC|Roger.|T
1355200|PAO|This is Apollo control. The flight dynamics officer reports that the burn very nominal. Almost precisely as planned, the burn duration was about 3 seconds long, but the velocity change was almost precisely what we had been expecting. At the present time, Apollo 11 is 1076 nautical miles from the Moon. The velocity continuing to drop off, down now to 6,698 feet per second.|P
1355448|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if during the TEI burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS. Over.|T
1355505|LMP|Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. Over.|T

1362427|CMP|Roger. Understand.|T
1362810|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.|T
1362822|CMP|Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light Command Module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.|T
1362914|CC|Roger. Thank you much. We were looking at the playback, and we saw some things that - right at start up. We'll be back with you later on that.|T

We'll pick up the tape conversation and then stand by for any following live communications with the crew. We anticipate that they will be shortly beginning their pre-sleep checklist in preparation for a well deserved rest period.|P
1364941|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the taped conversation. We'll stand by for any further live communication from the crew before they begin their sleep period. We've gotten some preliminary figures from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transearth injection burn after a review of the telemetry data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal. Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost precisely as predicted or planned in the Flight Plan. That would be at 195 hours and 18 minutes, 40 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. And we would expect that splash down time to change somewhat during the transearth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for mid-course correction becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at almost precisely 1 mile per second, 5,283 feet per second and that's just updated 5,280 feet per second.|P

1365252|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1365253|CC|Roger, 11. This is the regional Capcom. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.|T
1365322|CDR|Okay. Thank you, boss. We'll - We're looking forward to a little rest and a restful trip back, and see you when we get there.|T
1365331|CC|Roger. You've earned it.|T
1365341|PAO|That exchange was between Donald K. "Deke" Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center, and astronaut Neil Armstrong.|P

1371711|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1371712|CC|Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over.|T
1371739|CDR|No. It's about in the nine or nine thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.|T
1371751|CC|Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.|T
1371803|CDR|Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.|T
1371822|CC|Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.|T
1371837|CDR|I don't remember. Just that the Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.|T
1371851|CC|Roger. Thank you very much.|T
1372110|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you keep me honest on the lithium hydroxide changes? When do you have the next one scheduled for?|T
1372118|CC|Stand by.|T
1372210|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, on that canister, we had you due to change one at 133 before TEI, and it's on page 399. The next one we got is at 147. Over.|T

1372544|CDR|11. Roger.|T
1372719|PAO|This is Apollo control at 137 hours, 27 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of about 4,982 feet per second. At about 5,900 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 198,900 nautical miles from Earth. A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene on the lunar surface at the time the planned Ascent Stage lifted off. Armstrong reported seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton, which is a plastic-like insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is found on the outside surfaces of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes, about 40 minutes or so ago that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived of the coolant, in a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant. The platform apparently began to become unuseable after about 4 hours, and the computer itself finally gave up after about 7 hours, 13 minutes. Both items going considerably longer than had previously been predicted. The Lunar Module Ascent Stage still in lunar orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. All other systems appear to be functioning well at this time. The LM orbit we show as currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And, the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and here's a call to the crew.|P
1373013|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
1373015|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.|T
1373020|CMP|Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.|T

1375221|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 137 hours, 52 minutes. Apollo 11 crew has signed off for the night, starting a well deserved rest period. Duration of the rest period is programmed for 10 hours, however, the wake up time is not critical. It's very likely that we'll let them sleep until they wake up of their own accord. At this time Columbia is 7,045 nautical miles away from the Moon, headed toward home at a velocity of 4,868 feet per second.|P
1380135|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 02 minutes. Capcom Owen Garriott has just put in a call to the crew and is passing up some antenna information to them. Here's that conversation.|P

1380423|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Ten minutes ago we logged what we expect to be our last contact with Eagle in lunar orbit. That coming at 137 hours 55 minutes Elapsed Time. At that time the battery power fell below the level where the secondary guidance system could hold the attitude of the vehicle within the sphere of antenna limits. We do not expect to establish contact with Eagle again. We'll continue to stand by here live. There may be a little more conversation before the crew turns in for the night.|P

1381126|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 11 minutes. We do not intend to contact the crew during this rest period again. We will take this line down now and come back up if there is further conversation. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1390010|PAO|This is Apollo control at 139 hours. The crew of Apollo 11 is in the rest period. We have not contacted them within the last hour, and have not heard from them. All systems aboard the spacecraft performing well. Apollo 11 is now 10,149 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4659 feet per second. Spacecraft weight is 26,510 pounds. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1400007|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 140 hours. Apollo 11 is now 12,835 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,552 feet per second. All systems still performing well. Dr. Kenneth Biers, the Flight Surgeon, reports his data indicates all three of the crewmen are asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1410002|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 141 hours. Apollo 11 is 15,488 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,480 feet per second. The crew is still asleep. All systems continuing to perform very well. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1420307|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 03 minutes. Apollo 11 is 18,243 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,426 feet per second. Apollo 11 is in the Passive Thermal Control mode, the performance of all systems nominal, and the crew is asleep. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1430001|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 143 hours. Apollo 11 is 20,704 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 4,390 feet per second. The crew is still is the rest period. The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported this morning that weather conditions in the primary landing area are expected to the acceptable, the sky partly cloudy, the winds easterly at 10 knots, and seas of 3 feet are predicted. Tropical storm Claudia is now located 2300 miles east of the landing area and will not affect the weather in the landing area Thursday. This is Mission Control Houston.|P
1440001|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 144 hours. Apollo 11 is 23,289 nautical miles from the Moon approaching the Earth at a velocity of 4,361 feet per second. All systems performing well, and the crew still in their rest period. It does not appear likely that we will perform mid-course correction number 5 scheduled for approximately 150 1/2 hours elapsed time. However, a firm decision on this mid-course will not be made for approximately 3 1/2 hours. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1450000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 145 hours. Apollo 11 is 25,857 nautical miles from the Moon. Heading toward home at 4,338 feet per second. Apollo 11 will leave the Moon's sphere of influence at an elapse time of 148 hours 7 minutes 23 seconds. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1460001|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 146 hours. We have heard nothing from the crew. We assume they are still asleep, and that sleep period began at about 137 hours, 47 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is 28,421 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at a speed of 4,322 feet per second. The decision on mid-course correction number 5 is still tending toward not doing that mid-course, however the decision hasn't been made finally, and there will be some additional tracking prior to firming up that decision. At this point it appears that the mid-course path number 5 opportunity would require about 4 to 5 feet per second. By waiting until the opportunity of mid-course correction 6, about 7 feet per second would be required. We do not plan to awaken the crew, at least immediately. Let them continue sleeping. All spacecraft systems continue to look very good to us from the ground. We've completed the change-of-shift here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth, has relieved Milton Windler, and our capsule communicator is Astronaut, Bruce McCandless. At 146 hours, 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
1470005|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours. The Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that the crew appeared still to be sleeping, however, we have seen some signs of activity aboard the spacecraft. We suspect they may be awakening shortly. At the present time Apollo 11 is 30,980 nautical miles from the Moon and the speed is 4,308 feet per second. The Flight Plan for today is relatively quiet and we are continuing to await the crew's own awakening - we don't plan to awaken them from the ground at this time. At 147 hours, 1 minute, this is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1473003|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 30 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reported a short while ago that the Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, appears to be up at this time. Both Armstrong and Collins appear still to be sleeping. At the present time Apollo 11 is 32,253 nautical miles from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 4,303 feet per second. Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth has elected to perform the mid-course correction maneuver scheduled at transearth injection plus 15 hours. That would be at about 150 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The exact time of that mid-course correction is not critical and it could move around somewhat. We expect that it would be a velocity change of about 5 feet per second. We expect there will be some conversation with the crew before too much longer. We'll come back up when we hear from the spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 32 minutes.|P
1473849|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 147 hours, 39 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that all 3 crew are now awake. We expect to be hearing a "good morning" from the spacecraft before too much longer so we'll stand by for that. We said "good night" to the crew last night at about 137 hours, and 47 minutes so they have apparently had a good 10-hour rest period and we'll probably be getting a crew status report indicating just how much sleep each of the crewmen got. We'll stand by for any conversation with the spacecraft.|P

1482104|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours, 21 minutes. At the time the spacecraft crossed from the Moon's sphere of influence to the Earth's sphere of influence, that point at which the Earth is computed as having the dominant influence on the spacecraft trajectory, Apollo 11 was about 33,800 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 174,000 nautical miles from Earth. At the present time, the spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 3,994 feet per second with respect to the Earth. After awakening this morning, Neil Armstrong reported all 3 crewmen getting at least 8 hours of sleep. The commander received about - got about 8 hours, the Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins, about 8 hours, and Armstrong reported that Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin, got about 8 1/2 hours of sleep.|P

1482309|LMP|Roger. We're all listening. Go ahead.|T
1482312|CC|Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State, William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.|T
1482650|LMP|Look up the Dow Jones Industrials for us.|T
1482655|CC|Roger. Stand by a minute, please.|T
1483345|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston.  We see you in P00. When you can give us ACCEPT, we have a state vector and target load uplink ready for you.|T
1483415|LMP|Roger, Houston. I'm going ahead and start the computer.|T
1483418|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T
1483841|CC|Apollo 11, we've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.|T
1483847|CMP|Thank you.|T
1484341|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1484346|LMP|Go ahead.|T
1484348|CC|Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.|T
1484445|CMP|Every flight has to have some disadvantages, I guess.|T
1484450|CC|Roger. There is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1 1/2 point rise right after opening.|T
1484454|CMP|Well, don't blame the 11 point drop on us, anyway.|T
1484458|CC|Roger.|T
1484529|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.|T
1484600|CMP|Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.|T
1484743|CC|Roger.|T
1484748|CDR|And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF at completion of the retraction.|T
1484828|CC|Roger. Thank you very much. Out.|T

1485821|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 58 minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the crew a few minutes ago was for  mid-course correction number 5. That is scheduled to occur 150 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds. It will be a Reaction Control System burn using the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters. With a velocity change of 4.8 feet per second, and that will be retrograde. Primary purpose of the maneuver will be to adjust the entry conditions which is - would primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a Ground Elapsed Time of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured from Lunar Orbit Insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that - before the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and the Moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both bodies. And we would define this as the equal potential point. That will occur at 155 hours 30 minutes. And at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth, 52,543 nautical miles from the Moon. We're now 1 hour 28 minutes 26 seconds from ignition for the mid-course correction 5 maneuver.|P

1490318|CMP|Roger. Go ahead, Houston.|T
1490320|CC|Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.|T
1490333|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1490336|CC|Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?|T
1490344|CDR|I think only in my suit.|T
1490347|CC|Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?|T
1490415|CDR|I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.|T
1490430|CC|Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?|T
1490437|CDR|I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.|T
1490444|CC|Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.|T
1490457|CDR|Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the P CO2 gage.|T
1490506|CC|Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.|T
1490527|LMP|I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.|T
1490533|CDR|Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.|T
1490536|CC|Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -|T
1490540|CDR|No.|T
1490541|CC|Go ahead.|T
1490544|CDR|I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.|T
1490611|CC|Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.|T
1490635|LMP|No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.|T
1490640|CC|Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.|T
1490651|LMP|Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in jettison? Over.|T
1490659|CC|Say again, please?|T
1490703|LMP|Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.|T
1490710|CC|Yes. It was in.|T
1490717|LMP|Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the Command Module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.|T
1490734|CC|Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.|T
1492424|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.|T
1492441|LMP|Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.|T
1492453|CC|Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.|T
1494040|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours, 41 minutes. We're now about 49 minutes away from the first mid-course correction on this transearth leg of the Apollo 11 flight. That maneuver will be a 4.8 foot per second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters and is scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 150 hours, 29 minutes, 54 seconds. At this time, Apollo 11 is 171,017 nautical miles from the Earth, and the spacecraft velocity is 4,043 feet per second.|P

1494444|LMP|Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.|T
1494453|CC|Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.|T
1494507|LMP|Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.|T
1494516|CC|Okay. If you would, at your convience, we'll be watching it down here.|T
1500332|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 4 minutes. Telemetry data at this time shows the spacecraft in the proper attitude for the upcoming mid-course correction maneuver. The crew will soon be verifying their attitude by taking a sighting on a star through the sextant and will be running some tests on the guidance and control system and, the Reaction Control System before the maneuver takes place. That burn now scheduled to come a little over 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 170,102 nautical miles from the Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4,058 feet per second.|P
1501018|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to try acquisition on the high-gain antenna for us at pitch minus 90, yaw 270. Over.|T

1502842|CC|Roger. We concur.|T
1502857|PAO|One minute now, until mid-course correction number 5. It will be a 10.9 second burn of the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters giving a change of velocity retrograde of 4.8 feet per second. The primary purpose of this maneuver will be to control the spacecraft flight path angle at entry interface. We're now less that 30 seconds from the initiation of the burn.|P
1503002|PAO|They should be burning at this time.|P
1503015|PAO|And we show the burn off.|P
1503116|CDR|Houston, do you copy our residuals?|T
1503133|CC|Roger. We've got your residual fuel counter reading for us.|T
1503142|CDR|DELTA-VC is plus 0.2.|T
1503146|CC|Roger. Plus 0.2.|T
1503150|CDR|That was actually plus 100.2. Okay?|T
1503154|CC|Okay.|T
1503212|PAO|That mid-course correction was performed at a distance of about 169,000 nautical miles from the Earth at a spacecraft velocity of 4,075.6 feet per second.|P
1503527|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours, 35 minutes. Our telemetry data here on the ground shows that a mid-course correction maneuver just about nominal, burn duration 10.5 seconds. Prior to the maneuver, we were predicting a splashdown time of 195 hours, 17 minutes, 25 seconds. And we expect there will be some modification to that after we've had a chance to do some tracking following this mid-course correction maneuver. Apollo 11 is now 168,843 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 4,078 feet per second and we're continuing to see a very slow buildup in the velocity.|P

1512454|CC|Roger. You might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here.|T
1512502|CMP|Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?|T
1512507|CC|That's affirmative.|T
1512511|CMP|Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.|T
1512520|CC|Roger.|T
1512550|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.|T
1512606|CC|Roger. We'll check it out.|T
1513331|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.|T
1513352|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1513357|CDR|Go ahead, Bruce.|T
1513358|CC|Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet .5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts onboard? Over.|T
1513423|CMP|Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.|T
1513430|CC|Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.|T
1513517|CDR|We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.|T
1513622|CDR|We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.|T
1513657|CC|Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.|T
1513724|LMP|It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.|T
1513809|CC|Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.|T
1513817|LMP|Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.|T
1513857|CC|Roger, Buzz. We copy.|T
1513901|LMP|And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.|T
1513905|CDR|And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.|T
1513914|CC|Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.|T
1513956|CDR|Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.|T
1514117|CC|Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.|T
1514126|CDR|Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.|T
1514228|CC|Roger. We copy.|T
1514249|CC|Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.|T
1514256|CDR|Okay.|T
1514350|CMP|My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.|T
1514357|CC|Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.|T
1514621|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1514627|CMP|Go ahead.|T
1514629|CC|11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.|T
1514708|CMP|Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?|T
1514716|CC|Stand by a minute, Mike.|T
1515215|CC|11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.|T
1515225|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1515226|CC|Mike, over here on page 9-7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.|T
1515308|CMP|Roger, that. I was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done.|T
1515317|CC|Roger. We're still working on computing the rate for you.|T

1520828|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 9 minutes. At this time, the crew is getting the spacecraft set up to re-initiate the Passive Thermal Control. Apollo 11 currently 165,143 nautical miles from the Earth and traveling at a speed of 4,142 feet per second. The Flight Plan has relatively few activities scheduled for now through the beginning of the crew sleep period tonight. We do have a television transmission scheduled. I believe, the time on that is a little after 8:00pm Central Daylight Time. And we show the sleep period to begin at about 160 hours Ground Elapsed Time, or a little less than 8 hours from now. We'll continue to stand by for any conversation with the crew. It has been relatively quiet for a good part of today. We'll stand by for a call from the Capcom or from the spacecraft down to the ground.|P

In the process of reestablishing the Passive Thermal Control with the spacecraft in a slow rotation, we have apparently lost high-gain lock-on and we expect that the crew will reacquire lock with the antenna once the Passive Thermal Control is reestablished. At the present time Apollo 11 is 164,320 nautical miles from the Earth and the velocity is up now to 4,156 feet per second. We'll continue to stand by here for reacquisition of the spacecraft, for reestablishment of high-gain lock on.|P

1524750|CC|Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there.|T
1524756|CMP|It's all very quiet. We're just sitting here letting the thruster firing damp down. When they get good enough, let us know, and we'll start this PTC.|T
1524806|CC|Roger.|T
1524828|CMP|Nice to sit here and watch the Earth getting larger and larger and the Moon smaller and smaller.|T
1524837|CC|Roger. We'll give you a call when your rates have damped down sufficiently, and we're unable at the present time to predict what rate you should have seen at your last attempt to initiate PTC. We saw about 2 1/2 degrees per second. Over.|T
1524856|CMP|Yes. I believe that.|T
1524921|CMP|Buzz thinks we should have a PTC program built in the computer. He could very well be right.|T
1530713|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 153 hours, 7 minutes. At the present time, we are changing shifts here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Gene Kranz will be coming on to relieve Flight Director, Clifford Charlesworth. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be astronaut Charlie Duke. There will be a change-of-shift briefing in the news center, in the building 1 auditorium in about 10 minutes. At the present time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of 4,185 feet per second. The spacecraft is about 162,700 nautical miles from the Earth. During the change-of-shift briefing, we will take the circuit down. Record any conversation that develops with the spacecraft and play it back following the change-of-shift briefing. At 153 hours, 9 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P

1531927|CMP|Roger. I was just checking the radios, and how is the thruster activity coming?|T
1531950|CC|11, Houston. The radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We've got 0.03 degrees per second in pitch now.|T
1532004|CMP|Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up. We've got the Earth steady out window 1. We have the Moon steadily out window 3 and, of course, we are locked up on the high-gain. So as long as the thermal people are happy, we're happy.|T

1533333|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1533334|CC|Okay, 11. We are about ready to start PTC. I would like to give you some high-gain antenna angles, though. We'd like to operate in the REACQ mode, and do you plan on spinning up in the positive or negative direction? Over.|T
1533350|CMP|We can do it either way. I had planned the positive.|T
1533354|CC|Okay. For positive, the high-gain antenna setting should be pitch plus 30, yaw 270, and in REACQ. Over.|T
1533409|CMP|Understand. REACQ, pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Thank you.|T
1533412|CC|Roger. And if you would, when you're making your DSKY entries to set up for PTC, go a little slower, and we'll try to follow each entry from down here. Over.|T

1544116|LMP|Negative. It's not. The last time we broke lock, we went to AUTO, and I left it there. Sorry.|T
1544122|CC|Roger. We'd like to have you to put it in REACQ, and monitor. In about 2 minutes, we'll be coming up on the high-gain. Would you monitor the REACQ? If it doesn't take, acquire manually. Over.|T

1545051|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Any special attitude you'd like us to look at for the TV? Over.|T
1545108|CDR|I don't guess we have a requirement there, Charlie.|T
1545113|CC|Roger. We have an attitude that we can get the Earth out of a window or the Moon. We're trying to look at - find one that we can get both, if that's what you'd like. Over.|T
1545135|CMP|A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Charlie.|T
1545140|CC|Roger.|T
1545148|LMP|That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.|T
1545158|CC|Roger. Well, we'll just stop on the 50 roll, then, and we'll give you the word when to do that. Over.|T
1545208|CMP|Okay.|T
1545303|PAO|This is Apollo Control 154 hours, 53 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 40 hours, 9 minutes to entry. Apollo 11 homeward bound 158,378 nautical miles out from Earth velocity now 4,267 feet per second. We have some 3 minutes of tape accumulated over the past half hour of minor conversations with the crew of Apollo 11. We'll roll these tapes now.|P
1545641|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That completes, the accumulation of air to ground communications by means of tape recordings on the last half hour or so. It's quiet right now. No conversation going on between Spacecraft Communicator Charlie Duke and the crew of Apollo 11. And at 154 hours, 57 minutes ground lapsed time this is Apollo Control.|P
1552307|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have high-gain coverage about 155:30. At that time, you can turn on the TV if you desire, and continue your roll around until you get 50 degrees roll. Over.|T

It'll be through the 85-foot antenna at the Goldstone tracking station. The 210-foot dish out there is tied up tracking one of the Mars fly-by missions. We have some 20 seconds of tape accumulated. We'll play that back and rejoin the conversation live.|P

These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship, I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.|T

1554323|LMP|Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that we've left the Moon, I'd like to trace through them a little bit for you ... developments that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already ... type of a drink container. A little later, Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially, this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with water, and the drink then dissolves in the water, and this end of the ... outfeeding. Likewise, we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can probably see this shrimp cocktail meal. ... this afternoon while the two of us had salmon salad. Another early development was the use of bite size food ...|T
1554436|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, you're breaking up badly. Will you check your VOX? Over.|T
1554446|LMP|Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?|T
1554448|CC|Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.|T
1554457|LMP|Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go into the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.|T
1554616|LMP|I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to ... you're all very familiar with.|T
1554644|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high-gain shortly. Over.|T
1554702|LMP|You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.|T
1554752|LMP|See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.|T
1554811|LMP|Too close, I think.|T
1554831|CC|11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.|T
1554845|CMP|Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?|T
1554906|CC|That's affirmative, 11.|T
1554911|CMP|Okay. Well, as I say, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?|T
1554927|CC|Okay.|T
1554934|CMP|And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.|T
1555003|CMP|That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.|T
1555014|CMP|Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.|T
1555058|CMP|It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.|T
1555113|CC|Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.|T
1555123|CMP|Roger. Stand by one, and we'll get you that Earth one.|T
1555128|CC|Looks like you need a wine skin up there, Mike.|T
1555134|CMP|That'd be nice.|T
1555250|CDR|Okay.|T
1555252|CC|11, Houston - -|T
1555253|CDR|You have a picture now, Houston?|T
1555255|CC|That's affirmative. I refuse to bite on this one, though. You tell us.|T
1555301|CDR|Okay. This should be getting larger, and if it is, it's the place we're coming home to.|T
1555312|CC|Roger.|T
1555338|CDR|No matter where you travel, it's always nice to get home.|T
1555345|CC|We concur, 11. We'll be happy to have you back.|T

1555356|CC|Roger. Thank you very much, 11. That was a good demonstration and a good show. We appreciate it very much.|T
1555518|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Still up live with the air-to-ground circuit to Apollo 11 homeward bound. Now in the Passive Thermal Control mode, or barbecue mode, Charlie Duke is going to make another call to the crew. Let's listen in, in a moment. He's discussing with Flight Director, Deke Frank, who tonight is spelling Gene Kranz on this shift, although Gene is here. They're discussing some adjustments to the Passive Thermal Control mode. Apollo 11 has left the Moon some 53,666 miles behind it. And relative to the Moon, Apollo 11 is traveling now at 4,306 feet per second. Continue to monitor air-to-ground here till the crew settles down. They're not scheduled to go into their rest period until about another 4 hours from now.|P
1555724|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw - on 10. Over.|T
1555738|CMP|It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.|T
1555757|CC|Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.|T
1555807|CMP|No, we haven't, as a matter of fact. It's been dry in that area since we got rid of that last time.|T
1555814|CC|Roger. Thank you.|T

1555853|CC|Roger. We see that. Thank you much, Mike.|T
1560613|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apparently, there will be little conversation in the next half hour or so. Apollo 11 now 155 thousand - as you were - Yes, 155,906 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 4,316 feet per second. And at 156 hours 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
1560720|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Could you get a little summary of the evening news for us?|T
1560725|CC|Yes, sir. We'll have it for you momentarily. Also, a little Flight Plan update, Mike. If you - On page 31-13, you can delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.|T

1560803|CMP|How's the weather down there? You got any rain?|T
1560805|CC|Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, and it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.|T
1560825|CMP|Roger.|T
1560826|CDR|We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and I also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.|T
1560840|CC|Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have cleared up outside now, according to some of the people coming in. There's constant overcast in the MOCR here is a little hard to see outside.|T
1560857|CDR|Yes. We also noticed it was a little overcast down over - in the Antarctic ice cap, too.|T
1560900|PAO|This is Apollo Control. After first saying that there would be very little conversation, it seems there's quite a flurry of conversation between the ground and Apollo 11. Let's play back tapes and catch up and go live.|P

1561000|LMP|Hey, Charlie, what's the preliminary outlook for the weather in our recovery area?|T
1561004|CC|Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - FLIGHT just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast. There are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.|T
1561131|CC|Navy called up those special calm seas for you guys from up there on the Hudson.|T
1561139|LMP|Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess, though. We'll probably be giving it a pretty close eye.|T
1561145|CC|Roger.|T
1561403|CC|11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non-nominal stowage that we have onboard. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.|T
1561422|CMP|Roger. We'll do some work on that and let you know, Charlie.|T
1561427|CC|Thank you, sir.|T
1561444|CC|And, Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please place O2 tank 1 heater to AUTO? Over.|T
1561455|CMP|AUTO it is.|T
1561702|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
1561703|CC|Go ahead.|T
1561709|CMP|What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the Command Module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCGs which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.|T
1561806|CC|Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Out.|T
1561811|CDR|Roger.|T
1562211|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got the rates looking copacetic. You can go ahead and initiate PTC. Over.|T
1562222|CMP|Okay. Thank you.|T
1562223|CC|And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pins; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.|T
1562254|LMP|Roger. How many did you want me to change?|T
1562257|CC|Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.|T
1562323|LMP|Okay. There's three of them, is that right?|T
1562326|CC|That's affirmative.|T
1562329|LMP|And you want me to change all three.|T
1562331|CC|That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.|T
1562345|LMP|Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?|T
1562352|CC|No. We do not.|T
1562401|LMP|Well, I can show you my heart's still working.|T
1562405|CC|We believe it.|T
1562422|CDR|Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?|T
1562437|CC|Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.|T
1562623|CDR|Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDR at this point.|T
1562631|CC|Roger. Stand by.|T
1562641|CC|11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.|T
1562655|LMP|Okay.|T
1562656|CC|Thank you.|T
1563811|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
1563813|CC|Go ahead, sir.|T
1563816|LMP|Roger. I think the problem was that the center lead had dried out. ... put the new one on, and I'll see how that works. Over.|T
1563831|CC|Roger.|T
1563835|LMP|I can't tell you how good it feels to get it off.|T
1563837|CC|Yes. I can imagine.|T

1564841|CC|Go ahead, 11. Over.|T
1564844|LMP|Roger. How do you read my EKG now?|T
1564847|CC|Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high-gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.|T
1564903|LMP|Okay. I got my high-gain antenna coming out.|T
1564910|CC|Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.|T
1565237|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.|T
1565246|LMP|Okay. They're welcome.|T
1570355|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our tracking since the mid-course, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor and everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep.|T
1570420|CC|And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight--you're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Vietnam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination. And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V.|T
1570611|CC|And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.|T

1580343|CDR|That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."|T
1580351|CC|Roger. It sounded a little scratchy to us, Neil. Either that or your tape was a little slow.|T
1580403|LMP|It's supposed to sound that way.|T

1580447|CC|Oh, just - I - I'll never hear the last of that one about that Earth/Moon business during the TV there, and I was just saying that I was looking at the right side of the board here, so you are going towards the Earth. What are - What were you going to say, Mike?|T
1580503|CMP|You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?|T
1580508|CC|It's 2:30. Everybody will be asleep. I going to sneak off through the back way.|T

1580520|CC|Roger. Sure are. Everything's doing fine. All the gals are having a little party tonight, as far as I know.|T
1580529|CMP|Oh, good. Glad to hear it.|T
1582042|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTERs, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.|T
1582108|CMP|Yes. I'm all ears.|T
1582110|CC|Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 9-7, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.|T
1582123|CMP|Okay. I got it.|T
1582124|CC|Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35 400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDUs; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDUs, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.|T
1582250|CMP|Okay. I got you.|T
1582252|CC|Roger.|T
1582253|CMP|Man.|T
1582325|LMP|Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?|T
1582336|CC|I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDUs. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.|T
1582407|LMP|Roger. We're very scratchy.|T
1582410|LMP|Okay.|T
1582445|CC|11, Houston. We got you back now on the high-gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.|T
1582452|LMP|Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still may be. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?|T
1582518|CC|Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those 8 CDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.|T
1582531|LMP|Okay.|T
1582543|CC|11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.|T
1582557|LMP|Yes. I got that. Thank you.|T
1582559|CC|You're welcome.|T
1583331|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We got a recommendation for you on your stowage of the LM EVAs. Over.|T
1583341|LMP|Go ahead.|T
1583343|CC|Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraints. Over.|T
1583403|LMP|I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in their helmet bags, and I guess it's kind of nice to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVA's in the LEVA bags.|T
1583422|CC|Roger.|T
1583424|LMP|Yes. I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay sealed up.|T
1583428|CC|Okay. We - -|T
1583428|CMP|It won't hack B1, Charlie, with the cover. I tried it already.|T
1583433|CC|Okay, fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd - You check it out. Sounds like you've already done that, so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.|T

1622806|PAO|This is Apollo control at 162 hours, 28 minutes. The Apollo 11 spacecraft, Columbia is 138,674 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 4,692 feet per second. Spacecraft weight, 26,000 pounds. Flight director Glynn Lunney has just completed a status check with all of the Flight Controllers here, has gotten very good reports from all of them. The retrofire office here reports that on the present trajectory, Columbia's entry angle is minus 6.56 degrees. The nominal entry angle is minus 6.51 degrees. Retro expects entry velocity to be 36,194 feet per second. He calls these entry conditions excellent. The flight dynamics officer says that tracking is looking very good. Guidance navigation and control officer reports the Passive Thermal Control stable, operating very well. Reaction Control System looking very good. EECOM, the electrical environmental communications office reports cryogenics well balanced. The environmental control system looking good. All of the antennas and the power status in good shape. And, the Flight Surgeon reports the crew sleeping soundly. His data indicates all three crewmen were asleep by 160 hours, 42 minutes, and he reports they have taken no medication. And, recovery reports the weather looks very good in recovery area, and all conditions there are ready for a successful recovery. This is Mission Control at Houston.|P
1632802|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 163 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 135,920 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity, 4,758 feet per second. The crew's been asleep almost three hours now. All systems still performing well. This is Mission Control Houston.|P
1642805|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 164 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 133,131 nautical miles from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4,827 feet per second. Crew is asleep. Performance of all systems continues to be normal. We're 30 hours, 34 minutes, 37 seconds away from entry of Apollo 11 into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1652803|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 165 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 130,306 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 4,900 feet per second. Crew is still asleep and all systems are still performing well. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1662800|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 166 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 127,431 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity 4,975 feet per second. The crew, still sleeping all systems, still normal. The weather bureau's space flight meteorology group reported today that weather conditions for the landing of Apollo 11 tomorrow expected to be acceptable. Some showers have been reported near the landing area, but these are expected to move westward, leaving the recovery area with partly cloudy skies, east north-easterly winds 10 to 15 knots and 4-foot seas. Although tropical storms will not affect weather in the landing area, the Apollo 11 crew should get a good view of the tropical storm Viola, located in the western North Pacific, and also the remains of the tropical storm Claudia, located southeast of Hawaii. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1672803|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 167 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 124,520 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 5,055 feet per second. All still going well aboard Apollo 11. Maintaining a stable Passive Thermal Control mode, nose pointed toward the Earth, rotating 3 revolutions per hour. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1682800|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 168 hours, 28 minutes. Apollo 11's distance from the Earth is 121,550 nautical miles, velocity 5,138 feet per second. All systems still performing well. The crew, still asleep. The clock here in the Control Center shows 26 hours, 34 minutes, 37 seconds until entry into the Earth's atmosphere. This is Mission Control, Houston.|P
1692805|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 169 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 11 is 118,542 nautical miles from Earth approaching at a velocity of 5,225 feet per second. Crew is still asleep. Performance of all systems continues to be normal. Mid-course correction number 6, which was scheduled for an elapsed time of 172 hours, has been canceled. The trajectory is such that it will not be required. From the Manned Space Flight Network we have a report of a contribution to the Apollo 11 mission from a 10 year old boy in Guam. The Guam tracking station is receiving telemetry from this mission and had a problem with one if its antennas - a bearing. The bearing was replaced with the assistance of a 10 year old boy named Greg Force who had an arm small enough that he could work through a 2 and a half inch diameter hole to pack the new bearing. We're now showing entry interface with the Earth's atmosphere 25 hours, 33 minutes, 30 seconds from now, and the Green Team of Flight Controllers, led by Cliff Charlesworth, is now taking over from Glynn Lunney and his Black Team of Flight Controllers. This is Mission Control Houston.|P
1702803|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours 28 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reports that all three crew members, apparently, are still sleeping. And there are no immediate plans to awaken them at this time. Apollo 11 is presently 115,470 nautical miles from the Earth and the speed is up to 5,317 feet per second. In about 4 hours, at 174 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, Apollo 11 will be, in terms of distance, half way home. At that point it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Moon, and 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth. All systems on the spacecraft continue to function normally at this time. The spacecraft weight is almost an even 26,000 pounds. At 170 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
1705404|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 170 hours and 54 minutes. The Flight Surgeon reported a few minutes ago that telemetry data now indicates all three crewmen are awake after about 10 hours of rest. We expect we will be hearing from them shortly. Apollo 11 at this time is 114,146 nautical miles from here and the spacecraft velocity is 5,359 feet per second. A press conference with the principal investigators for lunar samples is scheduled to begin in about 4 or 5 minutes and during that press conference we will tape record any conversations with the crew and play them back following. And 170 hours, 55 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.|P
1705958|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Are you up and at them yet? Qver.|T
1710006|CDR|Well, we're up, at least, Owen.|T
1710009|LMP|Eyeballing my Magellanic Clouds. Over.|T
1710013|CC|11, Houston. Got your signals loud and clear, here. How are things this morning? Over.|T
1710025|CDR|Do you read us, Owen?|T
1710028|CC|Roger. Loud and clear, 11.|T
1710033|CDR|Okay. Everything ... to be all right here. So far, we haven't been looking in the cockpit yet. We've been spending our time looking outside the cockpit. ...|T
1710044|CC|Roger, 11. You're breaking up just a little bit there, Neil. Your signals are loud but are breaking up occasionally. Your spacecraft all looks good here from the ground. We noticed you stirring around the cockpit and thought we'd give you a call. Over.|T
1710100|CDR|Good morning.|T
1710109|CC|11, Houston. We do have a few items for you here, entry PADs, consumables, and so forth. After you've had a chance to get organized, whenever you're ready to start on a few of these items, why, we'll read them up to you. Over.|T
1710124|CDR|Okay. Stand by.|T
1710151|LMP|Go ahead, Owen. I've got the book now. I'm ready to copy.|T
1710154|CC|Okay, Buzz. On your Flight Plan items, a few updates first of all. We've cancelled mid-course number 6. Just remain - remain in PTC - give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the Flight Plan is we're ready for a BATT B charge anytime you want to put it on the line; and third item, we'd like a wastewater dump a little differently this time. We'd like to do it on our MARK from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes. And on our MARK, we would like to have a wastewater dump down to about 40 percent. I'll give you a more accurate level for the water dump a little later. Over.|T
1710254|LMP|Roger. You must have stayed up all night figuring this one out.|T
1710301|CC|11, Houston. Stand by just a moment here until we get out of the NO position on the antenna.|T
1710415|CC|11, Houston. We're over on OMNI Delta now. I think we can read you better. Did you get all those first three items on your Flight Plan update? Over.|T
1710427|LMP|I got mid-course correction canceled; battery B charge, and water dump on your call. Over.|T
1710436|CC|That's right, Buzz; and the last item here, we do request that we do a P52, even though we're not doing mid-course correction; and we'll suggest you get to that after the wastewater dump has been complete. We also have a state vector update for you, if you can give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.|T
1710510|LMP|Okay. You have the DSKY now.|T
1710513|CC|Roger. We'll be sending that up, and I'll give you your consumables update now. It's - for a time of 170 hours, your RCS total is minus 3.5 percent, Alfa is minus 14.5, Bravo plus 7, Charlie minus 4.5, Delta minus 3; hydrogen total is minus 1, and your oxygen total is plus 24. Over.|T
1710551|CMP|Roger. Copy those. And onboard readouts, D is 69, C is 73, D is - Let me start over again. Okay. A is 51 and B is 62; C is 63 and D is 59. Over.|T
1710648|CC|Roger, 11. Copy those, and we've checked them here on the ground, also. One correction to my last transmission. We would like that P52 prior to the wastewater dump, which is coming up in about 30 minutes from now. Will that be possible? Over.|T
1710705|CMP|Oh, yes. We'll take care of that.|T
1710708|CC|Roger. And if you're ready for an entry PAD, I'll read that up to you now, also, 11.|T
1710718|CMP|Ready to copy.|T
1710720|CC|Okay. Entry PAD is area MidPac: 359, 153, 001; 194:46:03, 267; plus 11.02, minus 172.03; 06.7; 36194, 6.55; 1187.5, 36275; 195:03:03; 00:28. DL and VL, all four are not applicable. D0, 4.00, 02:10; 00:18, 03:38, 08:21. 44, 293.2, 38.0. Boresight star is Scorpio Theta, up 31.4, right 3.4, lift vector up. Comments: Entry data assumes no midcourse maneuvers. Your Earth entry minus 30 minutes horizon check, 194 plus 33 plus 03. Your pitch is 297. This assumes an entry REFSMMAT. Your GDC align stars are Deneb and Vega. Roll, pitch, yaw; 078, 233, 340. Read back. Over.|T
1710959|CMP|Roger. MidPac Entry PAD: 359, 153, 001; 194:46:03, 267; plus 11.02, minus 172.03; 06.7; 36194, 6.55; 1187.5, 36275; 195:03:03; 00:28.

1711118|CC|11, Houston. That's Roger. Copy. 11, it's also your computer. You can go back to BLOCK.|T
1711129|CMP|Roger.|T
1711853|CDR|Okay, Houston. The crew status report is 8 1/2, 7, and 8.|T
1711902|CC|11, Houston. Roger, Neil. 8 1/2, 7, and 8 for your crew status.|T
1711909|CDR|Right.|T
1711914|CC|11, Houston. Your P52 looks good here on the ground, and we are now estimating that water dump will occur along about 171 plus 40; and we'd like for you to dump to 45 percent. This should let you arrive at Earth interface with just about a full load of wastewater. Over.|T
1711939|CDR|Understand 151:40, approximately, 40 percent.|T
1712215|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump to about 171 plus 30 just after we reacquire on the next OMNI, and - as I mentioned, it'll be down to 45 percent - is the new quantity. Also, we're standing by for your CM RCS ejector temperature readout. Over.|T
1712539|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNIs. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.|T
1712601|CMP|Okay, Owen. We're standing by for your mark, and stand by for the readout.|T
1712605|CC|Roger.|T
1712642|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy injector temperatures? I'll read them in volts.|T
1712648|CC|That's affirmative. Go ahead, Mike.|T
1712651|CMP|Okay. 2-4 is reading 4.7 volts, 2-5 is reading 4.8 volts, 1-2 is reading 4.8 volts, 1-4 is reading 4.8, 1-6, 4.5, and 2-1, 4.8. Over.|T
1712750|CC|11, Houston. Roger. Those - I got them all.|T
1712948|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for you to start your wastewater dump at this time. Over.|T
1713302|CMP|Roger. Dumping.|T
1713332|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. We show you - -|T
1713334|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've dumped to 45 percent, and we're stopping now. Do you concur?|T
1713338|CC|Roger, 11. We concur.|T
1715337|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery area any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.|T
1715347|LMP|Go ahead.|T
1715348|CC|11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures and comment upon on it when you do get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.|T
1715541|CDR|That sounds pretty good ...|T
1721718|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
1721724|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1721725|CC|11, Houston. We'd like to try operation with the high-gain array here. If you would select reacquire and your S-band antenna to high-gain, your positions are: pitch plus 40 and yaw 270, and then monitor for acquisition. Over.|T
1721750|CMP|Okay. It's in work.|T
1722001|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 20 minutes. During the press conference we established contact with the crew. Capsule Communicator Owen Garriot had put in a call at 171 hours about 10 minutes after the surgeon reported biomedical data showed all three crewmen awake. Neil Armstrong responded and we have received a status report from the crew and we also passed up the information, preliminary information, that they will use in the reentry tomorrow and gave them a weather report for the prime recovery area in the Pacific landing zone. We will play back about 12 minutes of taped conversation that we have accumulated to date and then stand by for any further live comments from the spacecraft.|P
1722126|CC|11, Houston. We're just now ready to switch from OMNI Delta over to your high-gain antenna. Can you confirm that you have gone to REACQ? Over.|T
1722136|CMP|Confirmed.|T
1722305|CC|That looks real good, Mike. Looks like we picked up about 30 dB on the signal strength.|T
1722313|LMP|Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.|T
1722324|CC|Roger. About 240 and 0.|T
1723753|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours, 38 minutes. Apollo 11 now 108,669 nautical miles from the Earth traveling at a speed of 5,534 feet per second.|P
1731817|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours, 18 minutes. There are virtually no Flight Plan activities scheduled at this time. The spacecraft systems all continue to perform normally, and at the present time, Apollo 11 is 106,482 nautical miles from the Earth, and velocity is 5,607 feet per second. At 174 hours, 24 minutes the spacecraft will be approximately half way between the Earth and the Moon in terms of distance, and it will be 102,888 nautical miles from the Earth and the same distance from the Moon. The spacecraft weight at this time is 26,000 pounds.|P
1733524|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Over.|T
1733530|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1733531|CC|Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.|T
1733544|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.|T
1733546|CC|Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.|T
1733615|CC|House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.|T
1733644|CC|Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Romania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.|T
1733730|CC|The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.|T
1733759|CDR|Good show.|T
1733759|CC|A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.|T
1733831|SC|(Laughter) ...|T
1733833|CC|Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, as you can tell.|T
1733855|CC|And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.|T
1733921|CDR|Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.|T
1733925|CC|That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can appreciate the rain we're getting right now.|T
1733936|LMP|That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.|T
1733941|CMP|That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.|T
1733953|LMP|Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.|T
1733955|CC|Roger.|T
1734005|CMP|Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're doing?|T
1734009|CC|Well, I'm not sure about yours. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.|T
1734037|PAO|Owen Garriott is the capsule communicator here in Mission Control at this time.|P
1734242|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours 43 minutes. Apollo 11 now 115,165 nautical miles from Earth, the velocity continuing to increase gradually at 5,652 feet per second. The cabin temperature in the spacecraft has been running around 62 degrees and coming up within the next hour Apollo 11 will be crossing the midway point in distance, that to occur at 174 hours 24 minutes and 7 seconds. There will be a briefing at 3:00pm Central Daylight Time in the Building 1 Auditorium on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.|P
1734747|CC|11, Houston. Over.|T
1734751|LMP|Go ahead.|T
1734753|CC|Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janice reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.|T
1734810|LMP|Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.|T
1734814|CC|Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.|T
1734822|CMP|Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellers. They don't say much; they just chomp away.|T
1734828|CC|Concur on that.|T
1734849|CMP|Which is about what we're doing up here.|T
1734853|CC|We concur on that, too.|T
1734920|CMP|Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.|T
1734928|CC|That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.|T
1734952|CMP|Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?|T
1735001|CC|I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.|T
1735248|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little Flight Planning for Apollo 12 up here.|T
1735255|CC|Roger. Go ahead.|T
1735258|CMP|We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get onboard for Al Bean.|T
1735307|CC|I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?|T
1735314|CMP|It'll be close.|T
1735355|PAO|That last comment came from Mike Collins referring Al Bean who is the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 12.|P
1735554|CC|11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.|T
1735612|CMP|Okay. Thank you. That's in work.|T
1735916|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?|T
1735927|CC|Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.|T
1735937|CMP|Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.|T
1735945|CC|Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.|T
1735952|CMP|Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.|T
1735954|CC|Roger.|T
1740006|CMP|And how'd you like the Command Module RCS temperatures?|T
1740019|CC|11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.|T
1740028|CMP|We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going to be required by a country mile.|T
1740039|CC|We think that's correct.|T
1740051|CMP|We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.|T
1740055|CC|Roger.|T
1740135|CMP|Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in PTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.|T
1740209|CC|Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.|T
1740217|LMP|Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.|T
1740221|CMP|I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I  thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.|T
1740254|CC|Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.|T
1740301|CMP|I usually do.|T
1740309|CMP|The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.|T
1740338|CC|Understand, Mike.|T
1740509|CC|11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.|T
1740526|CMP|Okay.|T
1740530|CMP|Is that a LM off phenomenon?|T
1740600|CC|11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.|T
1740613|CMP|Okay.|T
1740616|CMP|Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.|T
1740625|CC|Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.|T
1740632|CMP|Okay.|T
1741309|CC|11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green Capcom at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.|T
1741325|CDR|Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.|T
1741336|CC|Thank you, sir.|T
1741342|LMP|Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciate it.|T
1741346|CMP|Great job, you guys.|T
1741350|CC|Roger, out.|T
1741407|PAO|Astronaut, Bruce McCandless has just relieved Owen Garriott as Capsule Communicator. At 174 hours 14 minutes Apollo 11 is 103,440 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 5,713 feet per second.|P
1742630|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1742634|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.|T
1742637|CC|11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler inside the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We were wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.|T
1742728|LMP|Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.|T
1742745|CC|Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.|T
1742804|CMP|There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively, we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.|T
1742835|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.|T
1743456|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 35 minutes. Apollo 11 now 102,286 nautical miles from Earth and we have crossed the halfway point in terms of distance at 174 hours and 24 minutes and 7 seconds. The briefing on the Lunar Receiving Laboratory is scheduled to begin at MSC in Building 1. We'll tape record any conversations with the spacecraft to play those back immediately following the press conference. This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 36 minutes.|P
1744208|CMP|How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?|T
1744214|CC|Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.|T
1744226|CMP|Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar sphere at the press conference?|T
1744232|CC|No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.|T
1744241|CMP|Oh, oh.|T
1744246|CC|Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?|T
1744252|CMP|He's right. He's absolutely right.|T
1744405|CMP|How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?|T
1744416|CC|Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.|T
1744422|CMP|Oh, he must be mellowing.|T
1744424|CC|We've only got two of them back here right now.|T
1744430|CMP|He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.|T
1744441|CC|Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.|T
1744450|CMP|Touche.|T
1745108|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. A matter of curiosity: on our 70mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the Command Module; and both cameras - or all the 70mm cameras worked just fine.|T
1745127|CC|Okay. Very good. Thank you.|T
1750714|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1750719|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1750721|CC|11, this is Houston. Do you all have "Change Lima" for your entry operations checklist dated July 23? Over.|T
1750735|LMP|Dated when?|T
1750736|CC|July 23.|T
1750739|LMP|I'm not sure that we hung around long enough to pick that one up.|T
1750745|CC|Okay. If you've got the entry operations checklist handy, then I'll pass it up to you. Over.|T
1750753|LMP|How can you make changes after lift off?|T
1750804|LMP|You sure you don't mean June?|T
1750806|CC|Negative. It just came up today. Over.|T
1750813|LMP|So, you're the first to get to us. Go ahead.|T
1750819|CC|Okay. On page 6-1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and wastewater tanks during descent. Over.|T
1750856|LMP|Okay. We've got 6-1 out. Go ahead.|T
1750900|CC|Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O2 valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN." Do you copy?|T
1750949|LMP|Okay. Down at the bottom, after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH; SURGE TANK O2, OFF; and REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, OFF, DIRECT O2, ON" Over.|T
1751000|CC|Roger. And then down at the very bottom of page 6-2 where you see "DIRECT O2, OFF VERIFY", delete that step completely. Over.|T
1751020|LMP|Roger.|T
1751022|CC|And for record purposes, this will be "Change Lima." Over.|T
1751030|CMP|Okay. We've got it. How far open do you want this the DIRECT O2 valve to be opened at this point? And, I guess you want it - just leave it open from that point on?|T
1751043|CC|Roger. It should go all the way open, and you can just leave it on from that point on. The intent is to completely depressurize the oxygen manifold. Over.|T
1751059|CMP|Roger. Copy.|T
1751534|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information the All Star game has just ended with the National League winning 9 to 3 over American. Over.|T
1751549|CDR|Roger. Thank you.|T
1751552|CC|And I have a message here for Mike that says "All the chinch bugs are gone." Over.|T
1751605|CMP|Having done their job I guess.|T
1751610|CC|Well, along with one tree, it turns out.|T
1751615|CMP|Yes. I heard about that. That was right before the flight.|T
1751619|CC|Right. That big storm.|T
1754205|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 175 hours, 42 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 98,512 nautical miles from the Earth. The velocity, 5,892 feet per second. During the preceding press conference, we accumulated about 7 minutes of taped conversation which we'll play back for you now.|P
1755031|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That brings us up to date with the tape recorded conversation. We'll continue to stand by for any further communications with the spacecraft. During the previous conversations you heard Mike Collins toss a couple of good-natured barbs at Flight Director, Cliff Charlesworth. Collins was Capsule Communicator on Charlesworth's shift during the Apollo 8 mission. At 175 hours, 51 minutes Apollo 11 is 98,034 nautical miles from the Earth.|P
1762354|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you still up there? Over.|T
1762407|CDR|Yes, we are. But not quite so far as we were a while ago.|T
1762411|CC|Roger. We concur. We just wanted to make sure that we had good COMM with you.|T
1762418|CDR|Okay.|T
1762625|CC|For general information, 11, you are now 95,970 miles out from the Earth. Over.|T
1762639|CDR|Right in our own back yard.|T
1762642|CC|Say again.|T
1762646|CDR|Right in our own back yard.|T
1762654|CC|Roger that.|T
1762703|LMP|Trying to come down hill a little bit now. What's our velocity?|T
1762712|CC|Your velocity is 5,991 feet per second.|T
1762720|LMP|Thank you.|T
1762722|CC|And you are indeed coming down hill.|T
1764354|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 176 hours 44 minutes. Apollo 11 now 94,961 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity has just gone over the 6,000 foot per second mark. We're 6,029 feet per second. The next item scheduled on the Flight Plan is a television transmission. That's scheduled to occur at Ground Elapsed Time of 177 hours 30 minutes, which would be 6:02pm Central Daylight Time. Among the clocks counting down or up to and from significant events here in Mission Control. We have one counting down to entry. That clock now shows 18 hours 18 minutes and 12 seconds until entry. Reentry is scheduled to begin based on no further mid-course corrections at 195 hours 3 minutes 5 seconds. At this time, it appears that mid-course correction 7, if it were done, would only require 0.2 of a foot per second, and based on current tracking, we wouldn't expect to have to mid-course correction 7, although the tracking will be continued and a decision on mid-course correction 7 will not be made - until closer to the time of the maneuver.|P
1770835|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1770842|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|T
1770844|CC|Roger, 11. I've got a Flight Plan update for you to give you an optimum attitude for the Earth in the number 1 window and the Moon in number 5 window. Over.|T
1770900|CMP|Ready to copy.|T
1770902|CC|Roger. Your attitude will be roll 12 degrees, pitch 270 degrees, yaw 0 degrees. high-gain antenna angles, pitch plus 14, yaw 263. Over.|T
1770925|CMP|Roger. I copy. Roll 012, pitch 270, yaw 0. high-gain antenna, pitch plus 14 and yaw 263.|T
1770934|CC|Roger. And when coming out of PTC, you might be advised that your deadband has been collapsed, so follow the checklist items. Over.|T
1770946|CMP|Roger that.|T
1771055|PAO|And this is Apollo Control at 177 hours 11 minutes. Our network controller advises that we're starting to get some semblance of TV signal from the spacecraft. We suspect that we may be getting some checkout. We'll continue to stand by and be prepared to take whatever's sent.|P
1771222|CC|11, this is Houston. We're receiving a black signal from you right now, but we are getting TV. Over.|T
1771317|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The network controller now reports that the TV signal is down. Apparently having been turned off and we suspect that what we have is a test of the system by the crew. The television transmission from the spacecraft is scheduled to begin at 177 hours 30 minutes or about 2 minutes past 6, Central Daylight Time. At the present time Apollo 11 is 93,218 nautical miles from the Earth.|P
1772410|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1772414|LMP|Go ahead.|T
1772416|CC|From signal strength indications, it appears that we may be locked up on a side lobe with a high-gain antenna. We'd like you to go into wide bandwidth for about 15 seconds and then back to narrow. Over.|T
1772428|CMP|All right.|T
1773002|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 30 minutes. We're standing by at this time to receive television pictures from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. A short while ago we received the test transmission and apparently everything is functioning normally. We were receiving television signal from Goldstone relayed on through to Houston. We'll continue to stand by for the TV.|P
1773116|CDR|You have good S-band signal strength now, Houston?|T
1773122|CC|That's affirmative, 11.|T
1773129|CDR|You all set for TV?|T
1773134|CC|Roger. We're all set whenever you're ready to send.|T
1773138|CDR|Okay.|T
1773152|CC|Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.|T
1773202|PAO|We have black and white signals. We should have the conversion up shortly.|P
1773224|CDR|Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.|T
1773334|CC|11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.|T
1773339|CDR|We'll be right back with you.|T
1773340|CC|Roger.|T
1773351|CC|In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.|T
1773405|CMP|We're glad to hear that.|T
1773438|CC|Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.|T
1773444|CMP|Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the Command Module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our Service Module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factories. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.|T
1773752|CC|11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f-stop on the TV camera; try 2.2, please?|T
1773813|CC|That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.|T
1773820|LMP|Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here onboard our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."|T
1774142|CDR|The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next, to the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built those spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|T
1774200|PAO|That brief view of the Earth came from 91 thousand 3 hundred 71 nautical miles out in space. After a brief and sincere and moving transmission from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 177 hours 45 minutes.|P
1774351|CC|11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.|T
1774424|CDR|Apollo 11, signing off.|T
1774448|PAO|That brief view of the Earth came from 91,371 nautical miles out in space. After a brief and sincere and moving transmission from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. This is Apollo Control at 177 hours 45 minutes.|P
1774748|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?|T
1774756|CC|You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.|T
1774810|CMP|Thank you.|T
1775326|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.|T
1775333|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1775335|CC|Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one Flight Plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.|T
1775348|CDR|Go ahead.|T
1775350|CC|Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.|T
1775402|CDR|Okay.|T
1775403|CC|And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.|T
1775522|LMP|Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.|T
1775532|CC|Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.|T
1775542|LMP|Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.05g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.|T
1775622|CC|This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.|T
1775627|LMP|Okay.|T
1775629|CC|And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to the nominal. The RETRO's down here are anxious to get an accurate c.g. computed for you, and in particular, where the LEVA's are being stowed. Over.|T
1775653|CDR|Okay. We think we are going to put the LEVA's and helmets in the hatch bag, and we'll let you know any other nonstandard stowage locations that we complete this evening.|T
1775707|CC|This is Houston. Roger. Out.|T
1780656|LMP|Houston, Apollo 11.|T
1780700|CC|Go ahead, 11.|T
1780703|LMP|Roger. The magazine we'll be using for entry tomorrow is magazine M. Over.|T
1780710|CC|Roger. Understand. Magazine M as in Mike.|T
1780714|LMP|That's right.|T
1780718|CC|Thank you. Out.|T
1781737|CC|Apollo 11, this is Houston. Your friendly Green Team going off for the night, and going off for the last time. We wish to bid you a goodnight and Godspeed.|T
1781751|CDR|Thank you. We appreciate all that fine work done by the Green Team, and we'll be thanking you in person when we get back.|T

1785725|LMP|Roger. I'll do that right now.|T
1785730|CC|Roger. And if Mike has a minute, we'd like to do a little bit of troubleshooting. It seems he's either flat chested or something because we've lost respiration rate on the BIOMED telemetry. That is, the ZPN trace down here is flat.|T
1785755|LMP|He was shaving a little bit ago. He might have just let it slip. Hold on a moment.|T
1785805|CMP|All the blasted wires are all connected, is all I know.|T
1785811|CC|Okay, Mike. We had a request that you disconnect the yellow connector from the signal conditioner and verify that it looks okay, reconnect it and then, if you would, check the two electrodes that are placed one on each side of your lower rib cage. Over.|T
1785835|CMP|I bet you there's a smile on Charlesworth's face.|T
1785841|CC|Cliff is not on right now. Gene Kranz just relieved him a few minutes ago.|T
1785849|CMP|Roger that.|T
1785956|CMP|All those wires and things look normal up here.|T
1785959|CC|Roger, Mike. We could see variations on our traces. You've connected and disconnected, but the medics still don't have a signal.|T

During the past half hour there have been some exchanges between the spacecraft communicator, Bruce McCandless here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11. One item they're trying to sort out and troubleshoot some difficulties with the biomedical sensors attached to the chest of Command Module Pilot, Mike Collins. Let's play back the accumulated tape and hopefully by the time it's ended, we will have picked up communications again and we'll rejoin the conversation live. Roll tape please.|P

1813555|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.|T
1813600|CMP|Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Did you get the word on the entry checklist?|T
1813605|CC|Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready to talk about it, if you are. Over.|T
1813612|CMP|I think the quickest thing is to go through page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me?|T
1813625|CC|Roger. With you.|T
1813628|CMP|Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown; there is about half the food remaining in L3.|T
1813634|CC|Roger.|T
1813636|CMP|Where it says - where it says "And note," the CMP PGA is located in the L-shaped bag with the other two PGAs. The LM shield was jettisoned with the - Correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM, and his helmet and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags.|T
1813706|CC|Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in the L-shaped bag with the other two PGAs, and your helmet and gloves are in the L-shaped bag instead of the sleep restraint.|T
1813721|CMP|The helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in.|T
1813729|CC|Roger. I thought I - That's what I copied. Okay. Go ahead.|T
1813736|CMP|Okay. The next page is identical except a nitpicking point: out R1 we got the entry checklist. Other than that it is identical, and the third page has got some changes.|T
1813749|CC|Go ahead.|T
1813749|CMP|In A1 - Are you with me? I'm over there in compartment A1, now.|T
1813756|CC|Go ahead, Mike. Over.|T
1813804|CMP|Okay. Compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCGs. And compartment A8 delete two LCGs, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.|T
1813857|CC|Copy.|T
1813904|CMP|And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?|T
1813907|CC|Roger. Go ahead, Mike.|T
1813912|CMP|On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.|T
1813942|CC|Roger. How about the LEVAs, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.|T
1813953|CMP|They're in the hatch bag.|T
1813956|CC|Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.|T
1814015|CMP|Okay.|T
1814116|CC|11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.|T
1814202|CMP|Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.|T
1814206|CC|Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169, 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6-foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positon. Over.|T
1814320|CMP|Roger.|T
1814931|PAO|This is Apollo Control. To recap briefly, the conversation a few moments ago between Charlie Duke and the crew of Columbia. Because of forecast thunderstorms in the prime recovery area in the mid-pacific for tomorrow the Apollo Spacecraft's lifting capabilities will be used to stretch the entry path some 215 nautical miles farther downrange toward Hawaii to a new landing point, aiming point with the very rough preliminary coordinates of 13 degrees 19 minutes north by 169 degrees 10 minutes west. These numbers will be refined through the night as retrofire officer exercises a computer and comes up with more definitive numbers. These will be passed on as they are available. Apollo 11 now 75,951 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6,899 feet per second. At 181 hours 50 minutes and standing by on the air ground circuit this is Apollo Control.|P
1815159|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.|T
1815219|CMP|Roger. Infinity.|T
1815742|CC|Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're ready to put you to bed and say goodnight, if you give us your crew status report and verify that you changed out the CO2 canister a moment ago. Over.|T

1820515|PAO|This is Apollo Control. All goodnights having been said, the crew of Apollo 11 is now preparing to get their 10 hours rest and their last night in space. Here in the Control Center one of the 10 by 10 Eidophor television projectors - a drawing has been projected on the screen ribbing Capcom Charlie Duke for his slight error yesterday on the television pass where he mistook the Moon for Earth. It has the spacecraft midway between the Moon and Earth and it says, "Neil, I just spotted a continent on the Moon. Charlie, the camera's on Earth now." Apollo 11 now 74,906 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6,954 feet per second. And at 182 hours, 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
1820759|CC|11, Houston. We got some word just a moment ago that the McDonald Observatory is - said they had picked up the spacecraft in their telescope. Over.|T
1820809|CDR|Outstanding. We have been looking for their laser but haven't had much luck yet.|T
1820816|CC|Roger. We'll pass it on to them, Neil. Thank you.|T
1821002|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 182 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We thought that was all the air-to-ground for tonight prior to the crew going to sleep, but just a few moments ago, there was a brief exchange reporting to Apollo 11 crew that the McDonald Observatory in ... West Texas had the spacecraft in their telescope field of view. Let's roll that tape now and then shut it down again.|P
1821100|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That completes the very brief exchange of a few moments ago. At 182 hours, 11 minutes, this is Apollo Control.|P
1832507|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 183 hours, 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Columbia spacecraft, now 69,520 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at 7,262 feet per second. Crew now in their rest period. Started their sleep period a little over an hour ago. To reiterate the change in landing point, this is a weather avoidance situation where thunderstorms are forecast for the aiming point - the original aiming point in the Pacific, therefore, after the normal entry interface the lifting characteristics of the Apollo Command Module will be used to extend the entry range some 215 nautical miles farther down range, toward Hawaii, to a preliminary aiming point, that is the aiming point may shift around between now and entry which is some 11 hours, 36 minutes from now. But at any rate the aiming point as calculated now is some 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, by 169 degrees 10 minutes west longitude. The preliminary time of drogue deploy is 195 hours, 12 minutes. As you were - yes 195 hours, 12 minutes, 4 seconds. And the net extension over the earlier splash time is something like 40 seconds. At 183 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P

Apollo 11 now 61,034 nautical miles out from the Earth, and velocity of 7,815 feet per second. At 185 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.|P
1862749|PAO|This is Apollo Control 186 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 8 hours, 35 minutes to entry. Crew of Columbia still asleep at this time. Some 2 1/2 hours away from wakeup time at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Because of weather avoidance in the prime recovery zone in the mid-Pacific, southwest of Hawaii, it has been decided some time ago to shift the landing point, or aiming point - some 215 nautical miles downrange from the pre-mission aiming point. And all of the numbers concerned with entry and post-entry events have been generated, and we shall forward them at this time. Pencils ready? Command Module-Service Module separation, 194:48:07 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:20:08 Central Daylight Time; entry interface, that's 400,000 feet above the Earth's surface, Ground Elapsed Time 195:03:07, 11:35:08 Central Daylight Time; begin blackout, 195:03:25 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:35:26 Central Daylight Time; .05g, 195:03:35 GET, 11:35:36 CDT; end of blackout, 195:06:56 GET, 11:38:57 CDT; drogue parachutes deploy, 195:12:04 GET, 11:44:05 CDT; main parachutes deploy, 195:12:52, 11:44:53 CDT; touchdown, 195:17:49 GET, 11:49:50 CDT.

Cloud base is at 2,000 feet scattered. Wind, east north-east at 18 knots. 6 foot sea. Temperature 80 degrees. This landing area is 215 miles to the northeast from the original landing area, moved because of thundershowers in the original area. This new location should allow the recovery ship, USS Hornet to arrive in Hawaii 4 to 5 hours earlier than originally planned. We expect that it may be possible for the carrier to arrive at Pearl Harbor somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock, on July 26, that's Saturday.|P

Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190:50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work.|T
1901935|CDR|Okay.|T
1901937|CC|And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.|T
1901945|CDR|Glad to hear it.|T
1901948|CC|Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11:49am Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax-free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.|T
1902025|CDR|Hang on a minute.|T
1902030|CC|Roger. Standing by.|T
1902229|CDR|Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.|T
1902236|CC|Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine, Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee.|T
1902358|CC|Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers-in-law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.|T

1915030|CC|Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. On your GDC align pitch, it should be 233, 233 in the pitch. Over.|T
1915041|CDR|Okay. I've got a 233.|T
1915047|CC|Also your VL and MAX and MIN, I'm sure. are 22,400 and 18,000. Over.|T
1915056|CDR|Yes. That's right.|T
1915058|CC|Okay. If you'll dig out your entry checklist there on page E6-1, I'll update your RETRO times there for the various altitudes. Over.|T
1915111|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.|T
1915114|CC|Okay. On page E6-1, your RRT is 07:20, your 50k is 08:16; 40k is 08:30; your 24k is 09:02; and your 10k is 09:51. Over.|T
1915206|CDR|Okay. RRT, 07:20; 50,000, 08:16. That's - 07:20 is - is the time the steam pressure's pegged from RRT; and 40,000, 08:30; 24,000, 09:02; 10,000, 09:51.|T
1915248|CC|11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.|T
1915258|CDR|I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07:20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?|T
1915304|CC|That's affirmative.|T
1915307|LMP|Okay.|T
1915806|CMP|Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.|T
1915813|CC|Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.|T
1915945|CMP|Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until - bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.|T
1920008|CC|Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.|T
1920213|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 2 minutes. This will be first time in Apollo that crews have flown lift vector UP during reentry. Normally, lift vector is down. However, we want to extend the range by 215 miles so for a short period about a minute and 24 - 25 seconds during the blackout period the spacecraft will be flown with lift vector up. The computer program for that is number 65, up control. Apollo 11 is now 25,301 nautical miles from Earth, velocity has increased to 12,263 feet per second.|P
1923018|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 30 minutes. Apollo 11 now 22,130 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 13,053 feet per second. We're 2 hours, 32 minutes, 32 seconds away from entry interface.|P
1924828|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 48 minutes. Apollo 11 is 19,914 nautical miles from the Earth approaching at a velocity of 13,695 feet per second. We're 2 hours, 14 minutes, 16 seconds away from entry into the atmosphere. And, the U.S. Air Force C-135 crew will attempt to photograph this re-entry of the Command Module. Aircraft designated A-lots for airborne light-weight optical tracker system will attempt to record the entry on 70-millimeter still film. Pilot of that aircraft is the ARIA Squadron Commander. Three of his ARIA Aircraft will be in the entry area to provide communications during re-entry of the Command Module. Crew of ALOTS includes the aircraft Commander, Colonel Robert W. Hoffman of Wichita Falls, Texas. The pilot, who is the ARIA Squadron Commander, Colonel Oakley W. Baron of Kankakee, Illinois, Co-Pilot, Lt. Col. Wallace L. Emory, San Angelo, Texas. Navigators are Lt. Col. Ervin O. Stewart, Jr., Greensboro, North Carolina, and Major Charles W. Hinton, Mt. Auburn, Illinois. The photographic Specialist, Master Sergeant Paul T. Swieczkowski whose home town is not listed. Col. Baron's nickname is the Red Baron who is a veteran of more than 10,000 flying hours, and has flown more than 80 different types of aircraft.|P
1925214|PAO|Normally, the mission Control Center here in Houston will not attempt to contact Apollo 11 after drogue chute deployment. We will stay off the air and let the recovery forces attempt to establish voice contact. If for some reason, Capcom does want to communicate with the crew, he will request clearance from the recovery forces before putting in a call.|P
1925551|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours, 55 minutes. A few of the entry event times have changed from a second to 4 seconds. Others remain the same. Here's the updated times: entry, 195 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds; begin blackout, 195:03:25; .05g, 195:03:36; end blackout, 195:07:00; drogue shoot deployment, 195:12:08; main shoot deployment, 195:12:56; landing, 195:17:53.

1972254|NIXON|Nell, Buzz, and Mike. I want you to know that I think I'm luckiest man in the world. And I say this not only because I have the honor to be President of the United States, but particularly because I have the privilege of speaking for so many in welcoming you back to Earth. I could tell you about all the messages we received in Washington. Over one hundred foreign governments, Emperors, and Presidents and Prime Ministers and Kings have sent the most warm messages that we have ever received. They represent over 2 billion people on this Earth. All of them who have had the opportunity through television to see what you have done. And then I also bring you messages from members of the Cabinet and members of the Senate and members of the House and the Space Agency. From the streets of San Francisco where people stopped me a few days ago, and you all love that city, I know, as I do. But most important, I had a telephone call yesterday. The toll wasn't, incidentally, as great as the one I made to you fellows on the Moon. (Laughter) I made that collect, incidentally, in case you didn't know. But I called the three of, in my view, three of the greatest ladies and most courageous ladies in the whole world today, your wives. And from Jan and Joan and Pat, I bring their love and their congratulations. We think that it is just wonderful that they could have participated, at least through television, in this return; we're only sorry they couldn't be here. And also, I've got to let you in on a little secret - I made a date with them. (Laughter) I invited them to dinner on the 13th of August, right after you come out of quarantine. It will be a state dinner held in Los Angeles. The governors of all the fifty States will be there, the ambassadors, others from around the world and in America. And they told me that you would come too. And all I want to know - will you come? We want to honor you then.|T
1972509|CDR|We'll do anything you say, Mr. President. Any time.|T
1972513|NIXON|One question, I think, all of us would like to ask. As we saw you bouncing around in that boat out there, I wonder if that wasn't the hardest part of the journey. Was that - did any of you get seasick?|T
1972527|CDR|No, we didn't. And it was one of the harder parts, but it was one of the most pleasant, we can assure you.|T
1972533|NIXON|Yes, well, I just know that you can sense what we all sense. When you get back now - incidentally, have you been able to follow some of the things that happened when you've gone. Did you know about the All-Star game?|T
1972547|CDR|Yes, sir. The Capsule Communicators have been giving us daily news reports.|T
1972551|NIXON|They keep you posted.|T
1972552|NIXON|Were you American League or National League?|T
1972555|CDR|I'm [a?] National League man.|T

1972557|NIXON|That's right.|T
1972559|NIXON|There's the politician in the group, right.|T
1972602|CDR|We're sorry you missed that game.|T
1972604|NIXON|Yes, well - oh, you knew that too.|T
1972606|CDR|We hear that...|T
1972608|NIXON|The rain...|T
1972609|CDR|The rain. Well, we haven't learned to control the weather yet, but that's something we can look forward to as tomorrow's challenge.|T
1972612|NIXON|Right, right. Well, I can only summarize it because I don't want to hold you now. You have so much more to do. And gee, you look great - do you feel as good as you look?|T
1972620|CDR|Oh, we feel just perfect, Mr. President.|T
1972621|NIXON|Yeah, I understand your - Frank Borman says you're a little younger by reason of having gone into space, is that right. Do you feel that way, a little younger?|T
1972629|CMP|We're a lot younger than Frank Borman. (Laughter).|T
1972634|NIXON|There he is, over there. Come on over Frank, so they can see you. You going to take that lying down?|T

1972650|NIXON|Come on, Frank.|T
1972651|BORMAN|Mr. President, the one thing I wanted. You know we have a poet in Mike Collins and he really gave me a hard time for describing in words of 'fantastic' and 'beautiful'. And you - and counted them, in three minutes up there you used four fantastics and two beautifuls. (Laughter).|T
1972706|NIXON|Well, just let me close off with this one thing. I - I was thinking as you know, as you came down and we knew it was a success, and it had only been eight days, just a week, a long week. But this is the greatest week in the history of the world since the creation. Because as a result of what happened in this week, the world is bigger, infinitely. And also, as I'm going to find on this trip around the world, and as Secretary Rogers will find as he covers the other countries and Asia, as a result of what you've done the world's never been closer together before. And we just thank you for that. And I only hope that all of us in government, all of us in America, that as a result of what you've done, we can do our job a little better. We can reach for the stars, just as you have reached so far for the stars. We don't want to hold you any longer. Anybody have a last re... How about promotions, do you think we could arrange something? (Laughter)|T

1972724|NIXON|And incidentally, the speeches that you have to make at this dinner can be very short. And if you want to say fantastic or beautiful, that's all right with us. Don't try to think of any new adjectives; they've all been said. And now, I think incidentally, that all of us who - the millions that are seeing us on television now, are seeing you, would feel as I do that in a sense our prayers have been answered, and I think it would be very appropriate if Chaplain Piirto, the Chaplain of this ship were to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. If he would step up now. Chaplain, thank you.|T
1972903|Chaplain|Let us pray. Lord, God, our Heavenly Father. Our minds are staggered and our spirit exalted with the magnitude and precision of this entire Apollo 11 mission. We have spent the past week in communal anxiety and hope as our astronauts sped through the glories and dangers of the heavens. As we try to understand and analyze the scope of this achievement for human life, our reason is overwhelmed with abounding gratitude and joy, even as we realize the increasing challenges of the future. This magnificent event illustrates anew what man can accomplish when purpose is firm and intent corporate. A man on the Moon was promised in this decade. And, though some were unconvinced, the reality is with us this morning, in the persons of astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. We applaud their splendid exploits and we pour out our thanksgiving for their safe return to us, to their families, to all mankind. From our inmost beings, we sing humble, yet exuberant praise. May the great effort and commitment seen in this project, Apollo, inspire our lives to move similarly in other areas of need. May we the people by our enthusiasm and devotion and insight move to new landings in brotherhood, human concern, and mutual respect. May our country, afire with inventive leadership and backed by a committed followership, blaze new trails into all areas of human cares. See our enthusiasm and bless our joy with dedicated purpose for the many needs at hand. Link us in friendship with peoples throughout the world as we strive together to better the human condition. Grant us peace, beginning in our own hearts, and a mind attuned with good will towards our neighbor. All this we pray as our thanksgiving rings out to Thee. In the name of our Lord, amen.|T
