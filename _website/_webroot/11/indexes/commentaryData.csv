-024044|AFJ||The transcript begins over two-and-a-half hours before launch. With the Apollo 11 spacecraft sitting atop its Saturn V launch vehicle on Pad 39A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, announcements on the progress of the countdown are made by the Public Affairs Officer (PAO) Jack King, the 'Voice of Apollo'. The record of communications between the crew and the Mission Control Center, through 'CapCom' (the Capsule Communicator) commences soon after lift-off. This section of the journal will follow the flight through the launch and staging of the Saturn V launch vehicle, and insertion into Earth orbit about 12 minutes later. It concludes with the confirmation of orbital parameters and the safe check-out of the S-IVB third stage in orbit.
-023448|AFJ||Journal contributor Stephen Coester was a 28-year-old engineer who was working at a console (called C4HU) at the Launch Control Center. In a PDF file, <a href="pdf/stephen-coester-apollo11-lh2-leak.pdf">Launching Apollo 11 to the Moon</a>, he tells the story of this hydrogen leak.
-022352|AFJ||In fact, Fred Haise is the back-up Lunar Module Pilot. The other back-up crew members are Commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Bill Anders.
-022352|AFJ||When the crew arrived at the spacecraft they were already suited up and sealed off from Earth's natural atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen. By the time they are ascending, they will have been breathing pure oxygen for about three hours and will have flushed dissolved nitrogen from their blood. This is to guard against the possible formation of nitrogen bubbles in their blood as the spacecraft air pressure drops to its nominal value of about a third of sea-level pressure, or in case of an unintended decompression of the spacecraft. Between the suiting-up room and the spacecraft, each crewman carried his own oxygen supply in a suitcase-sized unit.
-004600|AFJ||The lowest of the Saturn's main tanks was filled with 810,000 litres of RP-1 three weeks earlier. RP stands for 'rocket propellant' which in this case has been highly refined to minimise the fuel's sulphur content. The range of lengths of the molecule chains that make up the fuel was reduced to around 12 carbons to ensure more consistent and predictable combustion properties. The level in the tank was checked again at T-13 hours and again at T-1 hour.
-004600|AFJ||All three stages use liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidiser component in the burning process. It has been rendered liquid by being cooled to about -183&deg;C, just below its boiling point thereby allowing large quantities to be carried in huge tanks. At nine hours before launch, nitrogen gas is pumped through the tanks to purge out air and water vapour contaminants. Six and a half hours before launch, the tanks are precooled to prepare them for the loading of LOX. The S-IC requires 1.3 million litres, that for the S-II takes 331,000 litres and the S-IVB's LOX tank requires 77,000 litres.
-004600|AFJ||Filling these tanks with such cold liquids requires a little finesse. Initially, the LOX is fed at a slow rate which furiously boils as it contacts the relatively warm tank structure. The vapourisation of the LOX takes heat away until a pool of liquid begins to form at the bottom. When enough liquid has collected, filling steps up to a fast rate until the tanks are nearly full. The slow rate is then reestablished to top them off. From then on, until three minutes before launch, the level is replenished as the volatile LOX continues to boil off from heat leaking into the tank.
-004600|AFJ||The fuel for the S-II and S-IVB stages is liquid hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>). Like LOX, it must be cooled to render it liquid, this time to -253&deg;C which is only 20K above absolute zero. Conditioning the LH<sub>2</sub> tanks is more involved because all gases will freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen except helium. Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold helium gas through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. After filling at a fast rate, and to compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before launch when the tanks are pressurised. Up to the launch, pressurising helium gas is supplied from the ground. After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure. For the S-IVB, additional pressurising gas comes from a set of helium spheres mounted on the stage.
-004059|AFJ||Range safety is concerned with ensuring that if the rocket were to go wayward, it would do so without threatening injury or death to those on the ground. The Saturn's propellant tanks have shaped explosive charges attached. In the event the launch vehicle cannot be controlled, these would be detonated to open the tanks and ensure their contents are dispersed while at altitude. The charges for the fuel tanks are placed on the opposite side of the vehicle from those for the oxidiser tanks so as to minimise the degree to which the propellants would mix as they are dispersing.
-003555|AFJ||The next announcement comes from the PAO at Mission Control in Houston, rather than the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy, Florida.
-003059|AFJ||At the very top of the launch vehicle, between the S-IVB and the spacecraft, is a ring, only 1-metre-tall, called the IU (Instrument Unit). The ring's diameter matches the rocket stage below it. It carries systems primarily concerned with the guidance and control of the vehicle. These include a digital computer, an analogue flight computer and an gyroscopically stabilised platform mounted within three gimbals. This platform's ability to stabilise itself is such that without external influence it would stay in a constant orientation with respect to the stars even while Earth turns and it would therefore appear to slowly rotate, even though it is actually Earth that is rotating. This is an effect known as gyrocompassing. However, while the launch vehicle is sitting on the pad, the platform must not gyrocompass. Instead, its pitch or Y axis should be at right angles to the intended heading of the vehicle, a heading which depends on the precise time of launch.
-003059|AFJ||In Apollo 11's case, a 9:32 am launch requires that the Saturn's groundtrack away from the launch pad will be on a bearing of 72.058&deg;. Therefore, the platform is aligned so that the minus-Z axis lies along that heading (or azimuth) and a servo system holds it there, not allowing it to respond to Earth's rotation. This is achieved using a theodolite located 210 metres directly south of the vehicle which shines a beam of light through a window in the skin of the IU and another in the casing that surrounds the platform. The platform's orientation with respect to the theodolite will be maintained until just 17 seconds before launch. After that, it is released and will maintain its orientation with respect to the stars.
-003059|AFJ||When the Saturn V sits on the pad, its axes are aligned with the points of the compass. But in order to fly along the intended heading, it must carry out a roll manoeuvre as soon as it has cleared the tower. This will align the vehicle's coordinate system with that of the platform. From then on, simply by carrying out a pitch manoeuvre, the vehicle will begin its tilt towards the horizontal while flying along the desired heading.
-000031|AFJ||The phrase 'guidance is internal' refers to the moment at T minus 17 seconds that the Saturn V's guidance system is no longer held in an orientation with respect to Earth. It is now inertial and holds an orientation with respect to the stars. It has already been prealigned to a azimuth of 72.058&deg;, the rocket's intended heading. Soon after launch, the vehicle will roll around in order to match that orientation before commencing a preprogrammed pitch manoeuvre to send it heading for low Earth orbit. This moment is more formally called Guidance Reference Release or GRR. GRR begins a 16-second period that inhibits the first of the Saturn V's control timebases.
-000031|AFJ||The F-1 engine has a complex ignition sequence which will be described here. First, a description of the engine.
-000031|AFJ||A large combustion chamber and bell have an injector plate at the top, through which RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure through 2,816 holes. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine section of this turbopump is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a chamber called the gas generator. After they power the turbine, these gases pass through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds them into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself.
-000031|AFJ||Directly above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump with two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets that feed high pressure fuel, via shut-off valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these feeds supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid, though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground, it being more suited for this purpose. At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator.
-000031|AFJ||The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel. To ensure ignition, a cartridge of fluid sits in a branch of the high pressure fuel circuit. It has burst diaphragms at either end and its own inject points on the face of the injector plate. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15 per cent triethylaluminium (known as TEA/TEB) and it is pyrophoric (i.e. self igniting) in the presence of liquid oxygen. Older documents refer to this substance as being hypergolic.
-000031|AFJ||At about T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer initiates a number of automatic operations in the engine which includes the firing of four pyrotechnic devices. Two of them are mounted inside the nozzle extension and cause the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters. Another two initiate combustion within the gas generator. Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, causing it to begin slowly rotating' The LOX then flows through the injector into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes another valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and their exhaust gas cause the turbine to accelerate. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve, which lets fuel pressure reach the igniter cartridge which promptly ruptures. TEA/TEB fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its ports where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.
-000031|AFJ||Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the build-up of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.
-000031|AFJ||This diagram shows how the thrust rose during the start-up of each engine. It takes two seconds for full performance to be attained on all engines once the first has begun to increase. The engines are started in a staggered 1-2-2 sequence so that the rocket's structure would be spared a single large load increase, with the centre engine being the first to start. The outboard engines exhibit a hiccup in their build-up due to the ingestion of helium from the pogo suppression system installed in each one. The centre engine does not have this installed.
-000031|AFJ||As the flow of fuel and LOX rises to maximum, the chamber pressure, and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved. With the turbopump at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.
-000031|AFJ||Public Affairs Officer Jack King, whose coolness is legendary, finally succumbs to the tension and is clearly heard to say "all engine running" instead of "all engines running".
0000000|AFJ||As the vehicle begins to rise, disconnection of an umbilical triggers the start of time base 1 in the Saturn V's control system. This sequence of events is concerned with the operation of the S-IC (except guidance) through most of its powered flight.
0000004|AFJ||As planned, control of the flight now passes from the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy, Florida to the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. There, communication with the crew is handled by an astronaut sitting at the CapCom console; in this case, Bruce McCandless. The PAO also switches, and Jack King relinquishes the commentary to the Houston PAO, whose voice is heard from now on.
0000015|AFJ||When it sat on the launch pad, the space vehicle's coordinate system matched the cardinal points of Earth's geograpic system. Its X-axis pointed straight up and its Y-axis pointed to true north. The third component of this system, the Z-axis, therefore was pointed directly west. Before it begins to tilt over, the vehicle needs to roll 18&deg; so that the minus X-axis, previously facing east, faces along the planned heading, in this case 72&deg; east of north. Then the tilt motion will be a simple pitch motion around the Y-axis.
0000015|AFJ||Prior to the roll maneuver, the vehicle executed a small yaw maneuver to deliberately lean away from the launch tower during its first few seconds of ascent.
0000015|AFJ||20.6 seconds after launch, time base 1 aims the four outboard engines slightly away from the centreline of the vehicle. This is in case an outboard engine fails whereupon the resultant off-centre thrust vector would be nearer to acting through the centre-of-mass of the rocket.
0000042|AFJ||Like the Space Shuttle that came after it, the flight of a Saturn V had defined times during which the means by which the crew could escape from a failing vehicle were defined. Unlike the Shuttle with its solid rocket boosters which gave no escape option during their operation, the Saturn had so-called 'abort modes' throughout its ascent, even during first stage boost. One of the advantages of liquid-propelled rockets is that they can be shut down. Solid motors will burn until they are done.
0000042|AFJ||For the first two abort modea, one-alpha and one-bravo, rotation rates exceeding &plusmn;4&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll will entail an abort.
0000042|AFJ||The first 42 seconds are flown in abort Mode One-Alpha. If things went wrong with the launch vehicle during this time, the Launch Escape Tower (LET) would lift the Command Module away from the booster. However, at this early stage, the CM needs to be taken away out to sea as the vehicle has not yet imparted much horizontal velocity. To achieve this in a One-Alpha abort, a small 'pitch control' motor would additionally fire to send the CM away from the vicinity of the impending conflagration. The CM then goes through an automatic sequence to carry out a safe landing on Earth.
0000042|AFJ||Mode One-Bravo is similar except the pitch control motor would not be required since the vehicle would have tilted over enough to aim an escaping CM out to sea. Instead, during a One-Bravo abort, a pair of canards at the tip of the LET would deploy to force the CM-tower combination to adopt a CM-first attitude. This was because hypersonic testing had shown that the CM-LET combination had a stable tower-first attitude. This mode extends to about 35.5 km altitude.
0000123|AFJ||As it flies through the air, the rocket must withstand an aerodynamic pressure imparted by its speed through the molecules of the atmosphere. This is like the pressure felt on a hand stuck out of the window of a fast-travelling car. In the rocketry situation, two things are happening to vary this pressure: the vehicle's rising speed makes it higher; the rapidly thinning atmosphere brings it down. The interaction of these two variables leads to a point in the ascent when the aerodynamic pressure, denoted by the letter 'Q', reaches a peak. This is known as Max-Q and is the point when weaknesses in the rocket's structure are most likely to be found out, especially if it has any slight sideways motion through the air. Max-Q occurs at 1 minute and 23 seconds into the flight.
0000159|AFJ||Mode One-Charlie begins at an altitude of about 30.5 km. At this altitude and beyond, the air is too thin for the LET canards to be effective so control of the CM's attitude during an abort would initially go to the its maneuvering thrusters. The acceptable range of vehicle rotation is altered and is now &plusmn;9&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll.
0000219|AFJ||135 seconds after the start of time base 1, its programming shuts down the central or inboard engine of the Saturn V in order to limit the vehicle's rapidly rising acceleration. There are two reasons for this rise. The first and dominant reason is that the mass of the vehicle as a whole is dropping by over 13 metric tons every second. As a result, the engines have a decreasing mass to push against. A lesser factor is the rising efficiency of the engines as they ascend out of sea-level air pressure into the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere. At sea level, the atmosphere acts somewhat as a cap on an engine's nozzle, getting in the way of the exiting gases. In a vacuum, the exhaust gases can exit without hindrance. The result on the F-1 is a 20 per cent rise in thrust. As the acceleration nears 4g, the shutdown of the inboard engine reduces it by one fifth.
0000219|AFJ||This graph is redrawn from the AS-506 Flight Evaluation Report. It shows how the acceleration experienced by the crew varies over the course of the Saturn's ascent. The key events in the graph are: <ol> <li>Lift-off under S-IC power. Note how the acceleration rises rapidly as the propellant tanks empty and the engines increase in efficiency.</li> <li>Cut-off of the central or inboard engine engine of the S-IC as acceleration nears 4g.</li> <li>Cut-off of the remaining four outboard engines of the S-IC at a peak of 4g.</li> <li>S-II stage ignition. Note the reduced angle of the graph. Although the mass of the first stage has been discarded, the thrust of the S-II stage is one ninth of the final S-IC thrust.</li> <li>Cut-off of the inboard engine of the S-II at a peak of approximately 1.8g.</li> <li>Change in mixture ratio caused by the operation of the PU valve. The richer mixture reduces the thrust slightly but also increases engine efficiency.</li> <li>Outboard engine cut-off of the S-II at approximately 1.7g.</li> <li>S-IVB stage ignition. Note again the reduced angle of the graph caused by the thrust being cut by a fifth.</li> <li>With the cut-off of the S-IVB's first burn, the vehicle is in orbit and the acceleration drops to zero.</li> </ol> The 4g experienced at the end of the S-IC burn is the highest that will be reached during ascent. The only time a greater g-force will be experienced during the mission is upon re-entry at the end when over 6g will be imparted on the crew.
0000219|AFJ||With the shutdown of the centre engine, the IU looks to see that the vehicle has gained sufficient velocity. If it has, then it begins time base 2 which will coordinate the end of the S-IC's flight, first by arming the separation pyrotechnics and by enabling the systems that detect the depletion of the S-IC tanks.
0000219|AFJ||The Saturn's guidance computer then performs 'tilt arrest'. Throughout the S-IC burn (and for the start of the S-II), the vehicle has been flying a series of pre-programmed maneuvers called the tilt sequence. The yaw at launch and the roll to align the rocket with the launch azimuth were two of these. The major maneuver of the tilt sequence has been a slow tilt around the pitch axis towards horizontal as the vehicle climbs. Note that this form of guidance is not trying to aim for a particular point. Though it is taking account of where it is and how any wind is affecting it, it is not attempting to correct for it and so it is described as open-loop guidance. At the end of the S-IC burn when staging takes place, it is no longer desirable to have the vehicle rotating, so the tilt maneuver is stopped or arrested.
0000219|AFJ||When level sensors detect that the S-IC tanks are about to empty, a signal is sent to shut down the four remaining F-1 engines. This signal also initiates time base 3 which will coordinate all the events surrounding staging and the flight of the S-II (apart from guidance).
0000244|AFJ||The S-IC first stage has shut down and separated from the S-II second stage.
0000244|AFJ||The sequence for separation is as follows: Half a second after shutdown of the first stage, four ullage motors mounted around the interstage are ignited. One fifth of a second later, a command is sent to fire the first separation explosive charge and to ignite eight retro rockets mounted in the conical fairings near the base of the S-IC. This results in two sets of rockets firing in opposite directions to pull the two sections of the vehicle apart once they are physically separated. 0.7 seconds later, the J-2 engines on the S-II stage receive their start command.
0000244|AFJ||The interstage ullage rockets were eventually deleted from the later Saturn Vs. Ullage is a brewer's term for the space in a barrel taken up by air rather than liquor. The rocket people modify its use to mean the establishment of a similar non-liquid space at the opposite end of a tank from the outlet so that only liquid leaves the tank with a degree of pressure to help it flow to the engine. This is usually achieved by firing small rockets to settle the tank's contents to one end.
0000246|AFJ||The S-II stage carries five uprated J-2 engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce a total of 5,141 kN (1,155,859 pounds) thrust. The engine design allows for restarting in flight but this feature is only implemented in the single engine used in the S-IVB.
0000246|AFJ||The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together to make a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously turn the fuel to a gas. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants. The hot gas exhaust is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell where its partial combustion is completed. The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the copper-faced injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector face is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this has 614 posts which pass LOX through holes in the injector face and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The gaseous fuel passes around each LOX tube, atomising the liquid as it emerges. Delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent of the gaseous hydrogen seeps through the injector face to keep it cool, the rest passing through the annular orifices.
0000246|AFJ||Valves are provided to bleed propellant through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings. The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter) is mounted in the centre of the injector face and fed with propellant. Energised by sparks at the start of a burn. it provides a flame to initiate and maintain full combustion.
0000246|AFJ||A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen. This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves while the hydrogen is used to spin up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust during flight to optimise stage performance.
0000246|AFJ||To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its tubular walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a pre-set delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the circumstances of the engine and the upcoming burn. A one-second delay is used for the S-II engines by virtue of them cooling each other in the confined space of the interstage. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the resultant exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14&deg; allowing LOX to enter the combustion chamber and begin to burn with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14&deg; is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.
0000246|AFJ||As the thrust of each second stage engine reaches 65 per cent, it causes its indicator light on the Main Display Console to be extinguished.
0000315|AFJ||Between the first and second stages is a large ring with a height of 5.5 metres and 10 metres in diameter to match the stages above and below. This ring, the interstage, is there to make room for the S-II's engines which protrude some distance below the bottom edge of the stage's wall. The interstage, or skirt, exists in its form because of the need to separate the two stages across two planes.
0000315|AFJ||Were the interstage to stay with the S-IC, there is a danger that any slight rotation of the massive first stage would cause contact between the giant ring and the engine bells on the S-II. Therefore the first cut is made directly above the S-IC using a shaped explosive charge to sever tension ties that join the stages. This leaves the interstage attached to the S-II. However, the ring imposes a significant mass penalty on the second stage. So much so that it is considered a mandatory abort if the interstage doesn't separate. Once 30 seconds has passed after the first separation, enough time for the second stage engines to establish smooth acceleration with minimal rotation, another explosive charge severs the ties that hold the interstage just below the S-II's tank assembly.
0000315|AFJ||It is interesting to note that the interstage failed to separate on the Saturn V that lofted Skylab to space. Nevertheless, controllers allowed the S-II stage to continue and it successfully inserted the orbital workshop into orbit, benefitting from the lower overall payload that Skylab represented.
0000336|AFJ||Although Armstrong as commander has his own window through the Boost Protection Cover attached to the Launch Escape Tower, and Aldrin in the center couch can see through the hatch window above his head, Collins in the right-hand couch has had his windows covered up to this point.
0000336|AFJ||With the loss of the escape tower, the flight moves to abort mode two. Now if the vehicle goes awry, the CSM would separate from the Saturn and either the Service Module's main engine or its small thrusters would be used to gain distance before the CM continues to a normal landing in the sea.
0000336|AFJ||Six seconds after the jettison of the escape tower, the guidance mode of the Saturn changes from dumb to smart, from open loop to closed loop. This is the Iterative Guidance Mode (IGM) whereby the guidance system is now actively plotting a course to the point in space and velocity where it will insert the vehicle into orbit. While the Saturn was in the thicker parts of the atmosphere, it was undesirable to allow it to make large attitude changes, hence the pre-programmed tilt sequence. Now that the vehicle is essentially in a vacuum, the computer can react to its actual position and velocity and issue steering commands to the engines as required to reach its goal.
0000521|AFJ||COI is Contingency Orbit Insertion. It is essentially abort mode three and means that if the S-II were to fail, the S-IVB would have the capability to add sufficient speed for the Service Module's large main engine to complete the job and place the CSM in Earth orbit. Of course, the spacecraft would not be able to depart for the Moon as the S-IVB's power would have been consumed in reaching orbit. Instead, the spacecraft would embark on a planned for, but hopefully never used Earth orbit mission.
0000600|AFJ||In case the Service Module's engine has to be used in the event of an abort, power is applied to two gimbal actuators containing motors, clutches and jack screws that will rotate the engine in its mount so that its thrust can be applied through the spacecraft's centre of mass.
0000745|AFJ||Actually, it's just the one engine, the central engine in the cluster of J-2s. On earlier Saturn V flights, it was noted how severe vibrations would build towards the end of the S-II burn. This was caused by the centre engine, mounted on a set of cross beams, setting up a longitudinal vibration in those beams. The solution adopted from Apollo 10 onwards was to shut that engine down before the vibrations were expected.
0000824|AFJ||The J-2 engine included a valve that allowed the mixture ratio (MR, the ratio of oxidiser to fuel) to be altered during the burn. This MR change was made to maximise propellant utilisation, hence the name PU shift.
0000824|AFJ||On the S-II, the strategy was for most of the burn to be made at a high MR of 5.5:1 which also yielded the stage's maximum thrust. Once a specific velocity had been reached, which occurred 5 minutes, 31.8 seconds after the engines were commanded to start, the MR for the remaining four engines was reduced to 4.34:1 for the rest of the burn. The effect of this was two-fold: it reduced the thrust from the stage by a quarter but it also increased the specific impulse and therefore the efficiency of the engines. If engineers had the timing of the MR change right, the intention was that both the LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX tanks should both be as close as possible to depletion when sensors indicated it would be prudent to shut down the stage.
0000824|AFJ||On the very early Saturn V flights (Apollos 4, 6 and 9), the timing was based on a closed-loop decision. Level gauges within the tank monitored how the propellants were being consumed and the change made based on that data. However, mathematical modelling had shown benefits to an open-loop decision, one based on the change in MR occurring when a specific velocity had been reached.
0000901|AFJ||The signal to shut down the S-II's outboard engines also initiates time base 4 in the IU. Like the previous time base, this will coordinate the events around staging and the subsequent control of the third stage. In particular, time base 4 will shut down the S-IVB stage when orbital velocity has been reached.
0000919|AFJ||The sequence of events for the first ignition of the single J-2 engine in the third stage is essentially the same as for the engines in the S-II. The main change is that the supercold fuel is allowed to flow through the walls of the thrust chamber to condition it for three seconds, instead on one, before the Start Tank discharges through the turbines, spinning them up in preparation for operation. Although the engine is enclosed in its own interstage structure, its isolation from other cold engines means it needs a little longer to chill the thrust chamber. For its next burn in over two hours time, it will have been exposed to the Sun's heat amd will require 8 seconds to chill the pipes.
0000919|AFJ||This well-known footage shows the separation of an S-IVB second stage from an S-IB first stage during the ascent of AS-202, a Saturn IB launch vehicle, on 25 August 1966. It is the only time an S-IVB was successfully filmed separating and igniting. What distinguishes this stage from an S-IVB used on a Saturn V was that this type had three solid-fuelled ullage motors mounted on its aft skirt whereas a Saturn V's S-IVB only had two. The three exhaust fans emanating from these three motors are very apparent.
0000919|AFJ||After the film was exposed, the camera was ejected and parachuted into the ocean, to be located by radio and recovered.
0001142|AFJ||The signal to shut down the S-IVB's first burn also initiates time base 5. This will control the transition of the S-IVB to the upcoming period of orbital coast.
0001854|AFJ||'P52' refers to a program within the onboard computer with which Mike will realign the spacecraft's inertial platform.
0001854|AFJ||Before launch, the platform at the centre of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was aligned to match the orientation of the launch pad at the moment of launch. For mechanical reasons, the orientation of this platform is prone to drifting away from the intended orientation so at regular points throughout the flight, it is realigned. This tendency to drift is normally very small but the intense vibration and shock that is present during launch and ascent tend to exacerbate it. Controllers can see this misalignment by comparison with the Saturn's own platform so prior to the first P52 realignment of the flight, they pass up a rough estimate of how much misalignment the CMP can expect to compensate for. This is the 'delta azimuth correction' figure.
0001911|AFJ||At the moment that Apollo 11 was inserted into its parking orbit around Earth, an effort began to determine the shape of that orbit. In the first place, controllers wanted to be sure the stack had enough momentum to continue around Earth and was not about to re-enter the atmosphere. Then from an operational standpoint, a good understanding of the orbit was a necessary starting point when calculating the burn that will take the spacecraft to the Moon. Initial indications came from the spacecraft's computer and ground estimations. But as the spacecraft passes over tracking stations, each will add further data points, especially those in Australia which are essentially on the opposite side of the world and which will provide an antinode determination of the orbit.
0002352|AFJ||The Public Affairs Officer then replays a tape of the air/ground communication that covers the ascent phase but which excludes his original commentary. Meanwhile, on <em>Columbia</em>, the DSE recorder is placed into record mode. This records digital data from sensors around the spacecraft so that engineers will be able to study its health for those periods that it is out of direct communication. The DSE includes a voice track to record the conversations in the cabin which is later replayed, along with the digital data, at high speed to a ground station. It is normal practice for this equipment to record throughout the ascent but this was evidently missed on this occasion.
0002922|AFJ||Buzz is quoting from page 2-9 of the Launch Checklist. Now Mike and Neil will pick up on step 7 from halfway down that page, and this is to configure the Environmental Control System (ECS) for the mission now that the launch phase has been completed.
0002956|AFJ||A few minutes before launch, the spacecraft's glycol/water coolant was prevented from flowing through the Service Module's two large radiators. The heating effects of passing through the atmosphere at high speed rendered them unable to reject heat and so a bypass valve was opened. Now that the radiators are in space, this valve is closed to restore the flow.
0002959|AFJ||The crew have a number of Hasselblad 70-mm (film width) stills cameras on board. These have detachable film magazines that can be changed part way through a roll. To prevent the film from being fogged upon removal from the camera, each has a 'dark slide', a thin metal plate that must be inserted to cover the film gate before the magazine can be detached.
0003008|AFJ||To determine that the radiator is doing its job, they will check that the temperature of the coolant at its outlet is colder than at the inlet.
0003318|AFJ||Mike is unstowing the DAC movie camera from a locker below the couches. Built by Maurer, it uses 16-mm wide film stock.
0003541|AFJ||Buzz is referring to the 18-mm lens that Mike has installed on the 16-mm DAC movie camera.
0003552|AFJ||Meanwhile, the Public Affairs Officer has been replaying a tape of the air/ground conversation through the launch phase to the press.
0003846|AFJ||An external cover on the opposite side of the Command Module from the crew hatch has protected the external surfaces of the navigation system's optics during launch. The cover is now ejected when Mike pushes a lever in the Lower Equipment Bay.
0003927|AFJ||Radar shows Apollo 11 to be in an extremely accurate circular orbit with an altitude of 103 nautical miles, better than earlier estimates.
0003940|AFJ||The side of the spacecraft opposite the hatch has two orifices through which the spacecraft's two optical instruments can peer. These are the telescope, a one-power, wide-field device intended to permit a star to be located within a constellation. It's field of view is ganged to one of the two lines of sight of the other instrument, a 28-power sextant with which angular measurements can be made. During ascent, the optics were protected by covers which Mike removes by pushing the optics control lever hard to the right.
0004032|AFJ||R-1 is the stowage locker at bottom right, below the LMP's couch.
0004157|AFJ||Mike is about to take sightings of the stars but must allow his eyes to become dark adapted.
0004502|AFJ||Mike is realigning the spacecraft's guidance platform in order to correct for any drift in its orientation since launch. This task is carried out with the aid or Program 52 in the computer and thus it is often called doing a 'P52'.
0004502|AFJ||The idea is simple. By taking sightings on only two stars, the orientation of the universe around the spacecraft can be determined. Coded into the computer's fixed rope memory are the positions of 37 stars, the Apollo star code list. Each has a numerical designation in octal (base eight).
0004502|AFJ||The computer therefore knows where these stars really are in the celestial sphere. With Mike's sightings, it now knows where they appear to be based on the current orientation of the guidance platform. Comparison of the two sets of data allows the error in the platform's orientation to be calculated and therefore be corrected. This is achieved by 'torquing' or rotating the platform by the required amount using the motors in the supporting gimbals.
0004726|AFJ||As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer can offer Noun 05 which has a value called the star angle difference. The computer knows the real angle between the two stars, thanks to its wired-in table, and it knows the angle between Mike's two sightings. If the two are identical, the star angle difference will be zero or 'all balls' thanks to it being displayed as '00000'. As it is, the value is '00001', four-balls one or 0.01&deg;, still a very good value and one which is better than predicted by one of his instructors at MIT, Glenn Parker. In his superlative autobiography, <em>Carrying the Fire</em>, Mike relates a story of having a bet of a coffee with Parker where Mike claimed he could achieve all balls whereas Parker thought he would only achieve four-balls two.
0004815|AFJ||Mike has sighted on star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri) and star 37 (Nunki, Sigma Sagittarii). The angles by which the platform needed to be torques were plus 0.018&deg; around the X axis, plus 0.033&deg; around the Y axis and plus 0.152&deg; around the Z axis. These results will be radioed to Mission Control at 000:53:35.

0005426|AFJ||Mike is passing on the news of his sighting accuracy.
0005933|AFJ||AOS Honeysuckle
0010600|AFJ||Neil seems to be passing around sweets.
0010922|AFJ||About now, Buzz turns to his left and takes a somewhat blurred color photo of Neil with the Hasselblad camera.
0010922|AFJ||Buzz then turns towards Mike and photographs him also, along with the TV camera which they have just been discussing.
0010932|AFJ||The television arrangements for Apollo 11 are complicated because it involves two cameras, one on the CSM and one on the LM. Each is fundamentally different from the other; the former is colour and uses commercial TV scan rates, the latter is monochrome and is essentially a slow-scan TV camera. As a result, there are two types of converters that are installed at some ground stations on Earth to convert their signals to a form that is compatible with conventional TV systems. Neil refers to a scanner/converter but strictly speaking, this unit is only for the LM's black and white camera whose slow-scan system is converted through an optical system. The CSM's colour camera is not slow-scan and is converted electronically using a magnetic disc system.
0010932|AFJ||Scanner/converters have been installed at the three major ground stations in Australia, Spain and at Goldstone in California. However, for the colour camera about to be exercised, the only equipment to decode the colour within its output is at Houston and Goldstone is going to link the raw signal from the spacecraft to the Manned Spacecraft Center.
0011809|AFJ||This is a jocular reference to the brevity of Armstrong's abortive flight on Gemini 8. Despite being the commander of Apollo 11, he has the shortest duration of orbital experience of the crew, albeit with the greatest experience of handling in-flight emergencies when he piloted the malfunctioning Gemini 8 back to Earth.
0012145|AFJ||During his Gemini 10 mission, Mike lost a camera overboard during a spacewalk.
0012228|AFJ||When the S-IVB engine ignites for TLI, it will impart an acceleration initially equivalent to 0.6g, rising to about 1.4g as the burn progresses. If the Hasselblad camera is not secured near the aft of the Command Module, there is a danger it could cause damage as it 'falls' to the floor.
0012510|AFJ||About now, Collins takes photo number AS11-36-5293 of the cloud-speckled Earth, looking east towards the Sun.
0012510|AFJ||Having lost the camera 5 minutes earlier, he has missed a sunrise photo, but he captures the glaring sun in the sky above the ocean, rising rapidly as a result of their orbital motion. He takes a further 8 photos at this point, through to AS11-36-5301. AS11-36-5298 is the best one showing the low pressure cell.

0013455|AFJ||At regular points throughout the mission, the CapCom will read up lists of numbers for the crew to write down. These may be to help track a landmark as it passes below. Most often they are the data the crew will need to manually carry out a burn of their engines. They have the jargon 'Pre-Advisory Data' or just 'PAD'.
0013731|AFJ||This is similar to the form that Mike is copying the data into.
0013731|AFJ||The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is a contingency in case of abort for a return to Earth with an ignition time approximately 90 minutes after TLI.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,481 pounds (28,794 kg). Strictly speaking, a more appropriate term to use would be &quot;mass&quot; rather than &quot;weight&quot;. Weight is defined as the force an object exerts when acted upon by gravity whereas mass is a measure of the quantity of matter an object contains. A 1-kg mass exerts 9.81 Newtons on Earth but we would tend to measure that force with a spring balance and call it 1 kilogram. On the Moon, it exerts 1.62 Newtons but its mass is still 1 kilogram so spring balances would have to be recalibrated to read properly. In space, without engines running (i.e. during coast), it exerts essentially no force at all yet still has 1 kilogram of mass.<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> -1.53&deg; and +1.32&deg;. The SPS engine is mounted on gimbals and can be aimed so that its force vector (the direction in which it pushes) acts through the spacecraft's centre of mass. These angles represent an initial direction for the engine. Once the burn begins, the spacecraft's control system continually adjusts the angle as the centre of mass shifts. Two thumb wheels on the left of the Main Display Console allow adjustment of these trim angles.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 4 hours, 10 minutes, 25.38 seconds. This is about 90 minutes after TLI.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -476.1 (-145.1); y, +0.1 (+0.03); z, +5,336.1 (+1,626.4). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal). LVLH is a frame of reference that is relative to a line drawn from the spacecraft to the centre of the body it is orbiting, or whose sphere of influence it is in. <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/pics/lvlh.gif" target="_blank">Diagram to explain the Local Vertical/Local Horizontal frame of reference</a>
0013731|AFJ||As well as the gyro-stabilised guidance platform, the spacecraft has a backup set of gyros. However, instead of being mounted on an independently stabilised platform, these are affixed to the spacecraft's structure. If the spacecraft rotates, these 'Body Mounted Attitude Gyros' (BMAGs) resist that turning and apply a force to their mountings. A measurement of this force provides the basis for a determination of attitude. If you know the starting attitude, then processing the signals from the BMAGs will permit the current attitude to be determined. It is the job of the Gyro Display Couplers (GDCs) to carry out this task, but there are two problems with this arrangement. First, the attitude measurement is much more prone to drifting away from the truth when compared to the measurements from the platform. Second, because of this drift, it regularly needs an accurate starting point. If the primary guidance system is working, then its knowledge of their attitude can be passed to the GDCs which is achieved merely by pressing the 'GDC Align' button. If, however, the primary system is not working, the GDCs must be aligned with reference to the stars. This is the reason that McCandless read up some GDC Align information.
0013731|AFJ||In the example given above, were the crew were to lose the platform and instead had to align the GDCs with the stars, they would rotate the spacecraft until the first star was aligned with the 50&deg; mark on the vertical line. The second star would be placed on the line but its position on the line would not be important. Then with the spacecraft in that orientation, its attitude with respect to the required REFSMMAT (the definition of their reference for attitude) would be given by the angles for roll, 71&deg;; pitch, 291&deg;; and yaw, 341&deg;.
0013731|AFJ||In addition, Mission Control sent up a second, short PAD which is intended for use in P37, a 'Return-to-Earth' programme. <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/pics/p37.jpg" target="_blank">Standard form in which crews copy P37 abort PAD data. Version in Flight Plan</a>.
0014013|AFJ||The docking probe at the tip of the Command Module is a crucial component of the docking system that will bring the CSM and the LM together. It will be used soon after they leave Earth orbit and head for the Moon to retrieve the LM from the top of the third stage. First it must be in its extended position. This is checked in Earth orbit because if it does not work, there is no point incurring the risk involved in heading for the Moon.
0014133|AFJ||Thus far, the sixteen thrusters of the spacecraft's RCS (Reaction Control System) have not been actually fired in space. All control of their attitude has been carried out by the engines or thrusters on the Saturn, so this is an opportunity to test this vital system while still in Earth orbit. The thrusters will have little effect as they will be acting against the mass of two fully loaded spacecraft and a nearly full S-IVB. Any deflection they make in the stack's attitude will be eventually cancelled by the booster's thrusters. Mission Control will be able to monitor both the firing of the thrusters and their effect on the stack's attitude via telemetry.
0014340|AFJ||Once they begin their burn for the Moon, the crew must be ready to detach the CSM from their booster if the latter begins to fail. To activate the explosive devices that physically cut the spacecraft free, certain pyrotechnic circuits and the sequencers that control their detonation must be armed.
0014417|AFJ||P00 is Program 00 though it is always pronounced as POO (like 'Pooh' in the A. A. Milne children's classic). Though the computer, a multitasking device, is always carrying out background tasks, it has a 'major mode', a program that is to the forefront of its activities and which is selected by the crew. For example, if the CMP wants to realign the guidance platform, he does so with the help of Program 52. On this occasion, Program 00 is selected which is a 'do nothing' program. They also threw a switch from Block to Accept. This Telemetry switch gives Mission Control access to the computer so they can directly access the 2K words of erasable memory that the computer uses for its sums and temporary storage. In this case, they want to upload a revised state vector into this memory.
0014417|AFJ||The state vector is a collection of six numbers plus time that define the spacecraft's position (in three dimensions) and velocity (also expressed in three dimensions). Now that the spacecraft has made a complete orbit of Earth, its state vector has been determined with some accuracy.
0014426|AFJ||TLI is Translunar Injection, the burn of the S-IVB that takes Apollo 11 out of Earth orbit and onto the Moon. The burn will raise Apollo's inertial velocity from 7,800 to 11,000 metres per second which will send it on a very long elliptical orbit with an apogee well beyond the Moon. The Moon's gravitational field will interfere with this trajectory, changing it to one that will bring the spacecraft around its far side and on a path back to Earth, a so-called free-return trajectory.
0014625|AFJ||This PAD is structurally different to most other propulsion PADs because the TLI maneuver is controlled by the IU (Instrument Unit) on the launch vehicle, and not the computer in the CM. The operational differences require that it is writen onto a different form.
0014625|AFJ||The timings for events relating to the launch vehicle are defined relative to a number of time bases, each of which start with a particular event. This allows controllers to move complete sequences of events relative to the overall mission time. The restart sequence for the S-IVB's single J-2 engine is called time base 6. When it begins, all subsequent events to restart the engine such as tank repressurisation, engine chilldown, ullage, etc., follow on, leading to the engine start command 9 minutes, 30 seconds later, and actual ignition 8 seconds after that.
0014625|AFJ||The crew also have tasks to perform in the minutes leading up to the TLI burn and they use their event timer to help them. They will preset it to read 51:00, to give them a nine minute count-up to ignition. At around 002:35:14, a light will come on for ten seconds to announce the start of TB-6. Thirty eight seconds later, the event timer is started and counts up towards (1:)00:00 and beyond. Items in the checklist are therefore shown with times from 51:00 onwards.
0014625|AFJ||The PAD is interpreted as follows.<br> <b>TB-6 predicted start:</b> This is calculated from current tracking data to be at 002:35:14, which implies that engine start will be commanded at 002:44:44 and that T<sub>IG</sub> (time of ignition) will be at 002:45:52. The actual start time is based on the solution to trajectory equations which depend on the vehicle's state vector.<br> <b>Attitude for TLI:</b> is 179&deg;, 71&deg;, 1&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively. This attitude is stated with respect to the orientation that the guidance platform has held since launch.<br> <b>Burn duration:</b> 5 minutes, 47 seconds.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub> prime:</b> 10,435.6 fps. This is the figure they will enter into the EMS's counter to allow them to monitor the burn's progress.<br> <b>Inertial velocity at engine cut-off, (V<sub>I</sub>):</b> 35,575 fps (10,843.3 m/s).<br> <b>Attitude for separation of the CSM from the launch vehicle:</b> 357&deg;, 107&deg;, 41&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively. Among the criteria for adopting this attitude is solar illumination of the S-IVB to allow the crew to practice maneuvering relative to it.<br> <b>Attitude for the extraction of the LM:</b> 301&deg;, 287&deg;, 319&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively.<br> If the crew decide they need to abort the mission soon after TLI, they should adopt a pitch angle of 223&deg;.

0015513|AFJ||This is the Emergency Detection System, which was switched off during ascent, becoming live. In a moment, Mike will check that the Entry Monitoring System is switched off.
0015712|AFJ||Buzz is checking the Entry Monitoring System which will be used to monitor the velocity gained during TLI, and again during the Transposition, Docking and Extraction maneuver when the LM is removed from the top of the S-IVB stage after Translunar Injection.
0015721|AFJ||Since the GDCs prone to drift, a push of the GDC Align button will pass the more accurate attitude values from the IMU to the GDC, giving the GDCs an accurate starting point for their measurement of attitude.
0015816|AFJ||A counter within the EMS will allow the effect of the upcoming TLI burn to be monitored. The crew are loading a value of 10,435.6 feet per second into the counter which is the change of velocity they will expect from the S-IVB. As the burn progresses, this counter will decrement towards zero.
0015825|AFJ||ORDEAL is Orbital Rate Display - Earth And Lunar, a device that makes the crew's 8-ball displays turn at a rate that matches their movement around Earth or the Moon. Set up properly, it allows the crew to monitor the spacecraft's attitude with respect to the ground below rather than with respect to inertial space.
0020444|AFJ||The crew will keep track of events leading up to TLI and beyond with their event timer, which they preset to read 51:00. This way, once they start it counting up towards 00:00, it will mark out the nine minutes that lead up to the moment the S-IVB engine ignites. Times are given in the checklist based on this methodology.
0020800|AFJ||The S-IVB's hydrogen tank is still quite full of supercold liquid fuel which, despite its internal insulation, is absorbing heat from the Sun and slowly boiling off. The resultant hydrogen gas is fed to propulsive vents at teh rear of the stage. The very slight acceleration imparted by these vents acts to settle the propellants in their tanks. It also has the effect of slowly raising the altitude of the stack. As more energy is added to the orbit, its shape is enlarged and the stack gains height. Counter-intuitively, it also slows down but this is because height is being traded for speed.
0021134|AFJ||The reference to boiling water is to do with part of the spacecraft's cooling system. Their electronic systems generate large amounts of heat, some of which warms the cabin interior but much of which must be removed. The majority of heat removal uses two large radiators mounted near the base of the Service Module, one on each side. During periods of high activity, additional cooling is provided by an evaporator that uses the vaporisation of water to dump heat.
0021134|AFJ||Evaporators, often referred to by the crew as "boilers", rely on the fact that energy is required to convert a liquid to a gas. When water is exposed to a vacuum, it quickly evaporates, and in so doing, takes heat energy from its surroundings. In the evaporator, spare water that has been generated by the fuel cells is fed through metal plates via tiny holes in the plate. Once through, it encounters a mass of porous stainless steel known as a wick, the other side of which is exposed to space. The water evaporates and takes heat with it, then passes out through the steam duct which exhausts at a port just under the commander's window. Pipes from the coolant system are passed through the wick assembly where they give up their heat to the vaporisation process. There are two evaporators, one each for the primary and secondary cooling systems.
0021134|AFJ||The fact that the boiler is no longer evaporating water is likely due to a lower workload by the spacecraft's electronics or the radiators working better over Earth's night-time side.
0024342|AFJ||That is, when the Event Counter on the main CM control panel reaches 42. In other words, when there are 18 seconds remaining.
0024807|AFJ||John Mayer was Chief of the Mission Planning and Analysis Division.
0025347|AFJ||Apollo 11 is now safely out of Earth orbit and on its trans-lunar trajectory. Next, it must separate from the final stage of the Saturn launch vehicle and extract the Lunar Module.
0025409|AFJ||The S-IVB stage, with the Apollo CSM still attached is going to change its attitude so that the Sun will shine across the top of the LM after separation. This will provide the correct illumination for the docking maneuver to follow, after the CSM has turned around 180 degrees.
0031628|AFJ||Mike has now taken over the left-hand seat from Neil in order to fly the CSM in the TD&amp;E maneuver.
0031637|AFJ||The Digital Event Timer will allow Mike to coordinate his actions. When the spacecraft comes off the S-IVB, he immediately wants it to start moving away. Therefore, he will begin thrusting forward just before separation.
0031647|AFJ||Mike is monitoring his speed with the EMS (Entry Monitor System). This unit includes an independent accelerometer and a velocity display. Procedures dictate that the display be set to read 100 feet per second, based on experience on Apollo 8 when it was found to not work well around the zero mark.
0031658|AFJ||Mike thrusts forward in the plus-X direction with the small Reaction Control System engines, so that when Buzz pushes the Sep (Separation) button on Panel 2, the CSM immediately starts to move away from the S-IVB stage and the jettisoned panels.
0031711|AFJ||Buzz is reading this off the Entry Monitoring System gauge.
0031740|AFJ||There are a set of valves that allow the crew to isolate the propellant tanks that feed the RCS thrusters. It was common for the shock of separation to cause a number of these valves to close. It was simply a matter of throwing the appropriate switches to open them again.
0031758|AFJ||'Proceed' is one of the buttons on the DSKY (Display and Keyboard), the crew's interface with the computer.
0031819|AFJ||This is one of the four Spacecraft Launch-vehicle Adaptor panels which contained the Lunar Module during launch. They were jettisoned by partial hinges once they had rotated 45&deg; away from the LM.
0031954|AFJ||Again, these numbers refer to the Entry Monitoring System Delta-V display. The accelerometer that provides the measurement for this display operates along a single axis only. Crews generally found that the rotation of the spacecraft during the turnaround maneuver caused the accelerometer to give erroneous readings.
0032015|AFJ||The BMAGs are a set of Body-Mounted Attitude Gyros. These gyros are attached directly to the body of the spacecraft rather than being mounted on a stabilised platform. The force they exert on their mountings provides information on the rate-of-change of the spacecraft's attitude. A box of electronics, the GDC (Gyro Display Couplers), convert this information into a measurement of absolute attitude, though with a substantial tendency to drift.
0032055|AFJ||This 16-mm footage was shot from window 4 with the camera looking into a mirror to keep it out of the way. The orientation of the image has been restored in this presentation.
0032132|AFJ||As the CSM approaches the LM, Buzz uses the Hasselblad camera to take seven shots.
0032320|AFJ||The S-IVB has its own attitude control thrusters packed into two units mounted onto the outside of the stage near the bottom. These are the APS units (Auxiliary Propulsion System, not to be confused with the Ascent Propulsion System on the LM).

0032403|AFJ||The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives the time of docking as 003:24:03.1.
0032413|AFJ||Three latches at the tip of the probe have engaged with the hole at the centre of the LM's drogue, achieving what is termed a 'soft-dock'. It is possible that there is a little sway of one craft with respect to the other so Mike allows the damping mechanism of the probe's tip to minimise it before he retracts the probe to bring the two ships to a 'hard-dock' condition.
0032450|AFJ||The CMC (Command Module Computer) has various modes of controlling the spacecraft's attitude, one of which is 'Free' where it makes no attempt to hold attitude. As it is now mechanically joined to the much larger S-IVB, it makes no sense for the CSM thrusters to fire as they will only fight those on the third stage.
0032549|AFJ||Given the various gyrations of the CSM, and Collins' concentration on the docking maneuver, they haven't established a good communications link with mission control. it will be another four minutes before CapCom gets through to them.
0034416|AFJ||The LM cabin is currently a vacuum. Prior to launch, a valve in the LM's overhead hatch was deliberately left open so that its atmosphere would evacuate during the ascent to space. To save using its consumables, the LM cabin will be repressurised using air from the Command Module cabin. However, the pressure in the CM must be kept within an acceptable range, so before they open the valve that will let their air into the tunnel between the two spacecraft, and hence into the LM, the crew need to ensure there is plenty of air in the CM. A pressure of 4.4 psi [30.3 kPa] is on the low side.
0034937|AFJ||The reason they are pressurising the LM at this point in the mission is to permit ejection from the S-IVB. In order to send the ejection command to the four support points where the LM is fixed to the S-IVB, two umbilicals within the tunnel must be connected. This requires opening the CM's forward hatch and going into the tunnel area, which must first be pressurised. But if the tunnel is pressurised, then so will the LM be pressurised owing to the open valves in the LM's overhead hatch.
0035113|AFJ||If they are pressurising the LM from CM air, then perhaps the flow of oxygen from the supply tanks into the cabin is higher than normal leading to an alarm being triggered.
0035327|AFJ||It is at about this point that a crewman, probably Neil given that he has just mentioned the view, takes two photographs of Earth half obscured by the structure of the Lunar Module.
0035327|AFJ||The second of these images shows enough of Earth's globe that a measurement can be taken to determine the distance to Earth at that moment. The calculation yields a value of about 18,700 km or 10,100 nautical miles. This calculation is the reason the image has been placed at this point in the journal.
0035327|AFJ||Although this image of Earth is incomplete, there is enough of the globe to allow a measurement to be taken across from limb to limb. A little analysis, including a few assumptions, then permits us to make an approximate calculation of the spacecraft's altitude when the photo was taken. By checking another high resolution scan from this film (in this case, AS11-36-5306 on mag N, scanned by JSC), the full height of a scanned frame was found to be 4,169 pixels. This represents 55.5 millimetres, the actual height of an image to the edge of the gate as measured on a negative from my contemporary Hasselblad 500C camera. This camera is of the same type and from the same era as the camera that was used to take these images. From this, we can calculate that one scanned pixel represents 0.013313 millimetres or 13.313 microns. We can use this to measure the diameter of Earth's image on the film.
0035327|AFJ||On frame 5326, the diameter of Earth's image was measured to be 3,059 pixels which implies that on the film itself, it was 40.72 mm across. On the assumption that the shot was taken using an 80-mm lens (as stated in the Apollo 11 photo catalogue), we can use an equation to determine the angle that Earth subtended to the camera. This is "angle = 2arctan(dimension/2 times focal length)". This works out at 28.56&deg;. Since we know Earth's radius to be 6,371 km, basic trigonometry gives us a distance of about 25,000 km. However, that is the distance to the limb, not to the sub-spacecraft point on Earth. For that we deduct the planet's radius which yields approximately 18,700 km.
0035327|AFJ||There are quite a few sources of error in this methodology. How accurate was my measurement of the camera's gate? The piece of film I used might have expanded or contracted when compared to when it was in my camera. Did the accuracy of the lens's geometry depend on where the image was? In other words, it is possible that the lens did not have a linear geometry. How accurately could the edge of Earth be defined on the scan? It was certainly a soft transition encompassing a few pixels and some sharpening was applied to give a better edge to measure against. Note also that the technique will yield more accurate answers when the photographs were taken near to Earth. Nevertheless, as the spacecraft continues its departure from Earth, this technique will give useful results and the calculation can be applied to all 49 images of Earth that show a measurable limb.

0041659|AFJ||The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives the time of Lunar Module Ejection as 004:16:59.1.
0044001|AFJ||The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives the time of the separation manoeuvre from the S-IVB's as 004:40:01.8.
0044615|AFJ||Remembering that the Moon is moving around Earth at about 1 kilometre per second, Apollo 11's trajectory is designed to pass its leading hemisphere. Doing so will take energy out of the spacecraft's trajectory because the lunar gravity is acting in a retrograde fashion. In this special case, this will cause it to loop right around the far side of the Moon and return to the vicinity of Earth. The S-IVB on the other hand will be slowed down in its coast so that it reaches the Moon later than the spacecraft. Specifically it will pass the trailing hemisphere. In a sense, the Moon will be ahead of it in their orbits around Earth and the lunar gravity will pull on the stage. In effect, energy will be added to the S-IVB's orbit with the result that it will be thrown out of the Earth/Moon system altogether and end up in orbit around the Sun, where it remains to this day.
0051425|AFJ||APS is the Auxiliary Propulsion System of the S-IVB, two independent, self-contained packages of tanks and thrusters at the base of the stage which handle its attitude control during coasting flight.
0053534|AFJ||Mike has just completed the star sightings for their second realignment of the guidance platform, an operation which he carried out using P52 on the computer. For this, he sighted on star 17 (Regor, Gamma Velorum) and star 34 (Atria, Alpha Trianguli Australis). These sightings indicated that across about 5 hours, the platform had drifted -0.172&deg; in X, -0.05&deg; in Y and 0.06&deg; in Z. The computer gave a star-angle difference value of 0.02&deg;. This is a comparison of the real angle between these two stars, and the measured angle. This value is acceptable.
0053534|AFJ||In the normal course of events, these values are left on the DSKY long enough for the engineers to copy them down from their telemetered copy of the display. However, in this instance, it is felt that the value for X is larger than expected (-0.172&deg; versus +0.018&deg;). Therefore Mission Control will get Mike to perform the P52 once more to check that an error in sighting hasn't crept in.
0053731|AFJ||TM is shorthand for telemetry; two syllables instead of four.
0053943|AFJ||Mike's second attempt at a P52 using the same stars, has yielded -0.171&deg; in X, -0.052&deg; in Y and 0.055&deg; in Z. The star-angle difference value is unchanged at 0.02&deg;. Since these values are very similar to the last, Mike will go ahead and torque the gimbals that support the platform to achieve realignment.
0054607|AFJ||This data is intended for an abort that would be burned eleven hours after TLI. The parameters are:<br> <b>Time of ignition:</b> 13 hours, 44 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 4,793 feet per second (1,461 metres/second).

0060002|AFJ||Having successfully removed the Lunar Module from the Saturn S-IVB, Apollo 11 moves away from the spent rocket stage. The stage's APS engines have been fired one final time to put it safely out of the way, on a trajectory towards solar orbit. The White Team, overseen by Flight Director Eugene Kranz, is about to take over the flight control role at Houston from the Green Team, headed by Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth, who have handled the mission to this point.
0060942|AFJ||Mike is about to begin a navigation task while Apollo 11 is still relatively near Earth. It will require that he takes a series of measurements of the angle between Earth's horizon and a chosen star. This information will permit the computer to determine their state vector.
0060942|AFJ||As the spacecraft coasts between the two worlds of the Earth/Moon system, its position and its speed constantly change and both can be defined at any moment in time. Because they are both expressed within a three-dimensional frame of reference, we end up with three numbers for position and three for velocity, six numbers in all. Collectively, these are known as a state vector. Once the state vector of an object is known, its trajectory can be computed forward or backward in time with respect to the bodies that it travels among. So it is with Apollo 11. If its state vector is known for a particular moment in time, then it can be accurately navigated to reach the right place around the lunar far side from where they can enter lunar orbit.
0060942|AFJ||There are two means of determining the state vector. The primary method uses the permanent radio signal between Earth and the spacecraft. But in case this is lost, the crew have a backup method that uses the angles between either Earth or the Moon and a defined star to achieve the same thing. For this, Mike, the onboard navigator, will employ the spacecraft's sextant to superimpose the image of a star on the horizon of the nearest world, in this case. Earth. Doing so yields an angle between the two.
0060942|AFJ||Were they to view Earth as they head away, the home planet would be seen to appear to move against the background of stars. At a particular time, a measurement of Earth's apparent position against these stars will only be valid for a particular trajectory. In other words, measurements of the star-horizon angles will define a particular trajectory and therefore will yield their state vector.
0062156|AFJ||Gimbal lock is a notoriously tricky concept to describe as it requires some three-dimensional mental gymnastics. The problem stems from the fact that the guidance platform in the middle of the IMU was mounted within only three nested gimbals.
0062156|AFJ||As the outer gimbal rotates by virtue of being joined to the spacecraft, the three axes, and the degrees of freedom of rotation they provide, can accommodate such rotation in order to maintain the platform's orientation in space. However, should the outer gimbal rotate so far that the angle it makes with the middle gimbal becomes too great, thereby aligning its axis with that of the inner gimbal, then we get the condition known as gimbal lock.
0062156|AFJ||With gimbal lock, because two of the axes are lined up, we have essentially lost one of our degrees of freedom and the gimbals are no longer able to maintain the platform's orientation.
0062156|AFJ||Mike is using Auto Maneuver to orient the spacecraft as necessary for his P23 exercise. However, he has found that having the spacecraft take itself from one attitude to the other causes it to get near the gimbal lock condition. The attitudes that threaten gimbal lock are indicated on the Flight Director/Attitude Indicator (FDAI) by a red patch on the ball.
0062156|AFJ||Using the FDAI as a guide, Mike can manually control the attitude of the stack in order to keep well away from gimbal lock.
0062547|AFJ||In the final weeks before launch, the crew had stayed at crew quarters at KSC. Their food was served up by Lew Hartzell, a former tug-boat cook who catered for all the Apollo crews.
0063501|AFJ||Mike is working through his P23 navigation sightings. Having taken a mark on a star/horizon angle, he has the computer return two values on the DSKY as Noun 49. These are Delta-R and Delta V which represent the difference between his current state vector and the new one implied by this star/horizon measurement. Delta-R is the change in position (or range) and Delta-V is the change in the velocity values, both expressed as a vector sum of the component values. His concern is that while a Delta-V of zero indicates no change in the velocity values, the Delta-R value is a change in position of 879.3 nautical miles. Although this seems excessively large to him, Duke will soon reassure him that Mission Control believe they understand why it is happening.
0063701|AFJ||Mike will repeat the star/horizon angle measurement to see if he obtains a similar result.
0064109|AFJ||Mike has been comparing his new state vector with one that has been extrapolated from their time in Earth orbit. Since then, the S-IVB has carried out the TLI burn and small errors from before then have built up to appear large as they hurtle away from Earth.
0064122|AFJ||Mission Control maintains a primary version of the state vector in a reserved area of the computer's 2K-word memory. There is another reserved area, the LM slots, which, while docked, aren't used for anything, since the LM's state vector is the same as the CSM's. Indeed, the CSM state vector can be stored in the LM slots as a backup. It is only when the two vehicles are separated, and particularly during rendezvous that when the two are needed. Then, CSM sextant sightings plus VHF ranging will provide the information necessary to update the CSM's copy of the LM's state vector in the LM slots. This is essential for the CSM to understand where the LM is for validation LM burn solutions, and most importantly if the CSM has to perform any rescue manoeuvres. But in the meantime, the LM slots are available for Mike to store his version of the state vector during his P23 exercises.
0064907|AFJ||<b>From page 4-3 of the Pilots' report of the <span class="attribution">Apollo 11 Mission Report:</span></b> &quot;Two periods of cislunar midcourse navigation, using the command module computer program (P23), were planned and executed. The first, at 6 hours, was primarily to establish the apparent horizon altitude for optical marks in the computer. The first determination was begun at a distance of approximately 30,000 [nautical] miles [55,000 km], while the second, at 24 hours, was designed to accurately determine the optical bias errors. Excess time and fuel were expended during the first period because of difficulty in locating the substellar point of each star. Ground-supplied gimbal angles were used rather than those from the onboard computer. This technique was devised because computer solutions are unconstrained about the optics shaft axis; therefore, the computer is unable to predict if lunar module structure might block the line of sight to the star. The ground-supplied angles prevented lunar module structure from occulting the star, but were not accurate in locating the precise substellar point, as evidenced by the fact that the sextant reticle pattern was not parallel to the horizon. Additional maneuvers were required to achieve a parallel reticle pattern near the point of horizon-star superposition.&quot;
0073321|AFJ||Crews often found that if the Sun was impinging near the optics apertures, it could cause substantial flare within their optical paths. It is worth reminding ourselves how incredibly dim even the brightest stars are with respect to the Sun. Stars are virtually impossible to see when the eye is adapted to sunlight and it usually needs a period of adaptation to the dark to allow any but the bright stars to become visible.
0073409|AFJ||Star 44 is Enif or Epsilon Pegasi. Mike will instead use 45 which is Fomalhaut or Alpha Piscis Austrini.
0074526|AFJ||Mission Control can see that Mike has omitted to press the Proceed button on the DSKY, which commands the onboard computer to implement the required activity.
0080408|AFJ||Already on this flight, Mike has a history of betting with cups of coffee. During Earth orbit, he mentioned a bet with Glenn Parker about the quality of his star sightings.
0080903|AFJ||It is unclear exactly what Mike is seeing when he is taking his angular measurements. The following drawings are to try to visualise the view through the sextant. The reticle (or graticule) in these diagrams is based on a drawing in a 1967 training manual.
0080903|AFJ||This represents the ideal situation as Mike sees it. The central line should coincide with the tangent to Earth's horizon at the point where the star's image is superimposed. It can also be parallel to that tangent. This ensures that the angle being measured is to the substellar point.
0080903|AFJ||In this version of what might be happening, the central line is not tangential to the horizon but the star is aligned on both it and the horizon. This would appear to lead to a larger angle being measured.
0080903|AFJ||In this version, the central line is tangential to the horizon but not at the substellar point. The star is aligned on the horizon. This would also appear to lead to a larger angle being measured. There is another possibility which is similar to the last case but the star is placed on the line rather than the horizon. It will transpire that Mike is right when they revisit the topic in the morning. The first of the above cases is how it should appear and his measurement will yield an incorrect angle.
0081113|AFJ||The explanation of the PTC REFSMMAT given above by the PAO is simplified. A REFSMMAT is a definition of a particular orientation in space, measured with respect to the stars. The PTC REFSMMAT is one to which the spacecraft's guidance platform is aligned. The spacecraft's attitude will therefore be measured against this reference, which has been chosen so that when the spacecraft is orientated to rotate broadside on to the Sun, it will do so without the platform going into gimbal lock.
0082549|AFJ||s Neil says, star 26 is Spica, or Alpha Virginis, and star 30 is Menkent, or Theta Centauri. Star 24 is Gienah, or Gamma Corvi.
0085315|AFJ||The Apollo 11 crew have handed over control of their onboard computer to Houston so that a new version of their state vector can be uploaded to the CSM slots in the computer's erasable memory. This state vector will be based on measurements made on Earth of their radio signal.
0090106|AFJ||Verb 66 instructs the computer to make a copy in the LM slots of the state vector that is in the CSM slots in memory.
0093644|AFJ||This is Mike's third opportunity to realign the guidance platform. In this case, he sighted on star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri) and star 32 (Alphecca, Alpha Coronae Borealis). Star 33 (Antares, Alpha Scorpii) was used as a check. The computer was commanded to steer the sextant to aim at Antares aa a check. After these marks, the platform was torqued to match the orientation defined in the PTC REFSMMAT that was recently uplinked to the computer. The star angle difference, a measure of the quality of Mike's sightings, was 0.01&deg;, a good result.
0094107|AFJ||It appears that having made the star sightings, Mike then directly torqued the platform around to the new orientation as per the PTC REFSMMAT. This meant that there was no determination of how much drift had occurred since the previous P52 4 hours earlier. On later flights (Apollo 14 onwards), it was normal that when changing the REFSMMAT, a note of the drift angles would be made using the old REFSMMAT, then torquing around to the new orientation.
0094219|AFJ||The four quad packages of thrusters that comprise the RCS are distributed around the girth of the Service Module, approximately around the CSM's centre of mass. They are labelled A to D. Normally, when attitude changes are made, opposite pairs are used so that the impulses are balanced, i.e. they are coupled to produce pure rotation with almost no translation. So A and C would fire together, or B and D.
0094219|AFJ||An issue with that is that each impulse comes from two RCS engines. On this occasion, for finer control of attitude they will use uncoupled thrusters, just one engine at a time. This is because they want to get the stack as stable as possible prior to spinning it around its long axis. Uncoupled thrusting will introduce small errors in their trajectory but tomorrow's midcourse correction manoeuvre and the tracking that will surround it will take that out.
0094219|AFJ||Based on measurements of scans of 70-mm magazine N, it appears that four photos of Earth are taken about now using the 80-mm lens. The calculated distance is roughly 87,000 km or 47,000 nautical miles.
0095319|AFJ||The lens on the Hasselblad camera is changed to a 250-mm telephoto and seven photos are taken on Mag N. The last four of these permit a distance calculation to be made of approximately 91,000 km or 49,000 nautical miles. The first three do not have enough of Earth's limb visible to make a distance determination but as they are virtually identical to the last four, they were evidently taken at the same time.
0103236|AFJ||This video, kindly donated by Mark Gray, is most of the video that was transmitted during this unscheduled show.
0103555|AFJ||The white spots refer to flaws in the television from Apollo 10 two months earlier. The Apollo TV cameras use electron beam vacuum tubes to create a picture. A photosensitive target has the optical image projected onto it. This target is at one end of a vacuum tube behind an optical glass window. At the opposite end is a hot wire that releases electrons. These are focussed into a beam of electrons which is then scanned across the target. The degree to which the electrons are accepted onto the plate depends on the charge that built up onto it due to the light. This way, the beam can be used to read out the image from the plate in a serial pattern, line by line. It is possible that damage or contamination of the target could cause errors in the read-out of the beam that would look like white spots.
0104658|AFJ||The Service Module has four cryogenic storage tanks; two for hydrogen and two for oxygen, both of which are required as reactants togenerate electrical power. The oxygen also supplies the crew with breathing air. Each tank is a double-walled, vacuum-insulated pressure vessel. Their contents are in a state known as supercritical, a combination of high pressure and cold temperature that renders the substance in a form rather like a dense fog. The systems that are fed by these tanks are designed assuming a high-pressure feed. However, as the reactants are removed, both the temperature and pressure will decrease. Steps therefore need to be taken to maintain a suitably high pressure and this is achieved using electrical heaters built into their interior. These can supply thermal energy that restores the pressure to an acceptable level. They can be controlled automatically using signals from pressure sensors, or manually with switches in the cabin.
0104658|AFJ||As heat leaks into the tank from outside, the density of the contents can be affected with the outer shell warming up slightly and becoming like a less dense layer surrounding more dense layers towards the centre of the tanks. This so-called stratification causes errors in the readings from the capacitance probes that run the width of the tank using electrical capacitance to measure quantity. To counter this effect, small fans are installed at either end of the heating assembly. these can be turned on to stir the tanks' contents and disturb any stratification.
0104658|AFJ||One of the oxygen tanks aboard Apollo 13 famously exploded when the operation of the fans led to an electrical short and a fire that ran out of control. The incident led to changes in subsequent Service Modules which included no longer using fans in the oxygen tanks.
0110101|AFJ||P37 is a Return-to-Earth program in the computer for use in an abort situation. Data read up from Mission Control is entered in a standard form: <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/pics/p37.jpg" target="_blank">Standard form in which crews copy P37 abort PAD data. Version in Flight Plan</a>.
0110101|AFJ||This form, here shown from the Flight Plan, has 14 places to write P37 data. Each place has a position for four separate items: the time of ignition, the desired change in velocity or Delta-V, the desired longitude for splashdown and the time the spacecraft would be expected to reach Entry interface, an altitude of 400,000 feet or 121 km.
0110356|AFJ||Within the three fuel cells in the Service Module, hydrogen and oxygen are reacted together through an electrolyte in order to create electricity. Additional products include water pure enough to drink which is also used to help cool the spacecraft through the process of evaporation. Waste heat is also generated which is dissipated through a series of radiators arranged around the top of the Service Module. Impurities in the reactants, chiefly argon, can build up within the fuel cells which can impede the reaction. This necessitated periodic flushing or purging of such contaminant by briefly increasing the flow of reactant. In general, oxygen purges were carried out daily and hydrogen purges were every two days.
0111849|AFJ||One of the problems that stemmed from the use of fuel cells to make their electricity and their water was that the water supply had a large amount of hydrogen gas dissolved in it. To fix the problem, they used a gas separator, a cylindrical device about 15 centimetres or 6 inches long which was connected in series with the hose that delivered their water. Within a slotted stainless steel cylinder, there was a tube of Teflon membrane through which the water passed. The membrane was hydrophobic, whereby it allowed gas to pass through but not water, as long as the outside of the membrane was not wet. The gas could then leave through the slots in the metal cylinder. The water continued to the end of the Teflon tube where it met a steel mesh that had been treated to be hydrophilic, easily passing water but impeding the gas.

0230742|AFJ||TM is short for telemetry. Aldrin and Mission Control are essentially comparing readings of the same parameter.
0231840|AFJ||Based on measurements of Earth's image on the scanned film of Hasselblad magazine N, it is likely that four photographs were taken around this time; three in quick succession and the fourth a few minutes later.
0231840|AFJ||By measuring the rotation of the planet between this next image and the previous, it appears that 5355 was taken about 13 minutes later.
0240425|AFJ||When Mike attempted to carry out a navigation exercise before their sleep period, it didn't go too well. The idea was that he would manoeuvre the spacecraft in order to aim the sextant's fixed line of sight at Earth's horizon. More specifically, Mission Control had given him accurate attitude angles that ought to have placed this at the substellar point, a point that is the nearest or furthest point on the planet's limb from the star with which the angle is being measured.
0240425|AFJ||After the exercise, Mike complained that Mission Control's values were not taking him to the substellar point, implying that an inaccuracy had crept into the system somewhere.
0241133|AFJ||Mike is carrying out a realignment of the spacecraft's guidance platform using Program 52 in the computer. The two stars that he will use are star 36 (Vega, Alpha Lyrae) and 37 (Nunki, Sigma Sagittarii). His accuracy in this instance is excellent as shown by a display of 'all balls' for Noun 05, the star angle difference. This is a comparison of the actual and measured angles between these two stars. From these sightings, he determines how far the platform has drifted since the last P52 15 hours ago. The values he will come up with, in Noun 93, are -0.493&deg; in X, -0.191&deg; in Y and -0.024&deg; in Z.
0241959|AFJ||During periods of no communication, when there is good reception from the spacecraft, it is not unusual for a little of the crew's conversation to break through onto the radio link, though very distorted. One instance of this prompts McCandless to think that the crew were calling.
0242508|AFJ||To take the PAO's explanation further, star 40 is Altair (Alpha Aquilae). With a newly aligned platform and a fresh state vector, the spacecraft's computer should be well-placed to calculate an accurate attitude to aim the sextant's fixed line of sight at the substellar point for the coming P23 cislunar navigation exercise.
0242508|AFJ||McCandless has asked for a Verb 66 which is an instruction to make a copy of the state vector that is in the CSM slots of the computer and put it in the LM slots. That will then become the starting point for Mike's P23 determination of the state vector.
0242933|AFJ||Noun 87 presents the optics calibration data. Having 'zeroed the optics' which brings the shaft angle to its centre, zero-degrees parking position, the procedure requires that a star be viewed through the sextant's fixed line of sight (known as LLOS or Landmark Line Of Sight in the documentation). The trunnion angle is then reduced to bring the image of the same star through the Star Line Of Sight (SLOS) to be superimposed on the LLOS image. In this condition, both the shaft angle and the trunnion angle ought to be zero; in other words, reading five balls on the first two register displays of the DSKY.
0243222|AFJ||When the CMP measures the angle between a star and a planet's horizon, he has to tell the computer whether he's measuring to the horizon nearest the star or furthest from the star. This is required because only one horizon will be visible depending on which side of the planet is illuminated by the Sun. Star 01 is Alpheratz (Alpha Andromedae).
0244304|AFJ||The sextant's arrangement has a fixed line of sight which can be rotated 360&deg; around a shaft, giving the shaft angle. When it does so, it takes with it a tilting prism arrangement that yields a moveable line of sight superimposed upon it. This latter axis derives it name from the supporting cylinders that emanate from the sides of an old-fashioned cannon to allow it to pivot in altitude. Those cylinders were known as trunnions and engineers took this term for the sextant's tilting arrangement and therefore we get a trunnion angle for the star line of sight which can be up to 50&deg; away from the fixed line of sight. The sextant's optical magnification is 28 times, which makes it an excellent instrument with which to study the now distant Earth.
0244804|AFJ||The attitude angles that the onboard computer came up with to aim the fixed line of sight at the substellar point on Earth's horizon, also happened to hide Alpheratz behind the LM, which perhaps says a litle about the lack of sophistication of the CMC's software. It is worth noting that with the objectives of the optics being mounted on the upper part of the CM's conical surface, the LM actually obscures a substantial amount of their field of view.
0250705|AFJ||Strictly speaking, it is the difference in pressure between the tunnel and the CM cabin. However, since a valve in the LM's overhead hatch has been deliberately left open, the reading will reflect the pressure in the LM cabin also. Note that the pressure gauge that Mike is reading is only connected across either side of the forward hatch when the Tunnel Vent Valve is in its &quot;LM/CM Delta-P&quot; position. If the valve is in any other position, then the gauge reading is meaningless.
0250705|AFJ||In Mission Control, the backup commander of Apollo 11, Jim Lovell, has temporarily taken the CapCom position.]
0254356|AFJ||Verb 59 means 'Please calibrate'.
0254824|AFJ||When water is dumped from the spacecraft, it has a tiny propulsive effect that affects the spacecraft's trajectory. Mission Control want the dump to go ahead soon so that radio tracking after the burn will be inclusive of the dump's effects. MCC number 2 in the Flight Plan will in fact be the first Midcourse Correction actually carried out, because MCC-1 was deemed unnecessary and was cancelled.
0255219|AFJ||An interpretation of the PAD follows.<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This burn is to correct the spacecraft's trajectory at the second opportunity given in the Flight Plan. The first opportunity was not used.<br> <b>System:</b> The burn would be made with the SPS engine under the control of the Guidance and Navigation System.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,059 pounds (28,603 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> +0.97&deg; and -0.20&deg;.<br> <b>Time of ignition, T<sub>IG</sub> (Noun 33):</b> 26 hours, 44 minutes, 57.92 seconds Ground Elapsed Time.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +11.8 (+3.6); y, -0.3 (-0.1); z, +17.7 (+5.4). These velocities are all with respect to the Earth and the local vertical and horizontal that the spacecraft makes with that body.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 277&deg;; Pitch, 355&deg;; Yaw, 15&deg;. This is with respect to the attitude of the guidance platform, itself aligned to the PTC REFSMMAT.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub> (Noun 44):</b> The apogee of the expected orbit. Not applicable.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub> (Noun 44):</b> Expected perigee of resulting orbit.

(5.1 m/s) This is the value to be entered into the EMS Delta-V display. A lower value, to take into account the extra thrust the engine imparts as it tails off, the EMS will stop the burn if the G&amp;N system fails to do so.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centaurus) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 208.2&deg; and 37.0&deg; respectively.<br> The next five parameters, which all relate to re-entry, are all not applicable to this burn.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> Stars 36, Vega (in Lyra) and 43, Deneb (in Cygnus) are to be used to align the gyro assemblies if it is not possible to use the guidance platform for this purpose.<br> <b>GDC align angles:</b> x, 7&deg;; y, 144&deg;; z, 68&deg;.<br> With the SPS propellant tanks nearly full, so there is no need for an ullage burn to settle their contents. The weight of the LM is 33,302 pounds (15,106 kg).
0255958|AFJ||It is unclear what Buzz means by 'P23 damage'. A possibility is that Mike is looking to see how his copy of the state vector, the one in the LM slots, has changed with his sightings.
0260000|AFJ||In other words, a mere 3-second burn of the SPS engine at this stage of the coast will change the height at which they pass above the Moon's far side by over 200 kilometres, an illustration of the sensitivity of celestial mechanics.
0260751|AFJ||As they manoeuvre, the signal from the spacecraft weakens and becomes noisier.
0260751|AFJ||Come the time of the midcourse correction burn, it is vital that the spacecraft be in the correct attitude so that the force applied by the engine will be in the right direction. As a check of their attitude, the manoeuvre PAD included a star, number 30 (Menkent, Theta Centaurus) that ought to be in the sextant's field of view when the spacecraft is properly orientated and the instrument's shaft and trunnion angles are as prescribed.
0261038|AFJ||The crew switch their communications to operate through one of the Command Module's omnidirectional antenna, Omni A.
0264613|AFJ||The normal range for combustion pressure (i.e. the pressure in the combustion chamber as a result of burning) is 95 to 105 psi (655 to 724 kPa).
0265006|AFJ||This is the Delta-V counter mounted on the EMS panel. It was set to the value of Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, 16.8, as given in the PAD. As the short burn progressed, this counter took the output from the EMS's accelerometer and used it to count down towards zero, whereupon it sent a shutdown command to the engine. The value was deliberately less than the actual desired Delta-V<sub>T</sub> (total) of 21.3 to account for the engine's tail-off thrust, the impulse supplied by the engine after the shutdown command.
0270742|AFJ||Image measurement and triangulation suggests that two photographs are taken around this time.
0271610|AFJ||When the spacecraft is in a relatively stable attitude, communications are usually via the High Gain Antenna as long as Earth is within the range of its articulation. This dish antenna can automatically track a ground station by sensing when it is going slightly off track. If the spacecraft is rolling in its Passive Thermal Control mode, a set of four omnidirectional antennae mounted at 90&deg; intervals around the periphery of the CM are brought into play. Normally only two of these antennae are used; B and D on opposite sides of the spacecraft, but these have to be switched every 10 minutes as the spacecraft rotates. It is possible for Mission Control to remotely switch the antenna but often they request that the crew carry make the switch.
0272241|AFJ||The specular reflection of the Sun off the ocean surface is a phenomenon that artists depicting Earth prior to the Moon flights usually failed to portray.
0272813|AFJ||Jim Lovell is referring to his and Buzz's flight in Gemini 12.
0274746|AFJ||Prior to their sleep period, Mission Control had notified the crew of some 'funnies' regarding the transducer that measures the flow of oxygen into the cabin. The flow of oxygen is not only necessary to keep the spacecraft pressurised against leaks and its consumption by the crew, it is also being use to gradually flush nitrogen from the cabin. At launch, the cabin was filled with a 60/40 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. As they ascended through the atmosphere, the mixture began to be dumped overboard until the cabin had reached about 5 psi (35 kPa), a third of sea level pressure. As the mission continues the remaining nitrogen will gradually be replaced with pure oxygen.
0283615|AFJ||The Command Module has four low-gain omnidirectional antennae spaced around its periphery, designated A to D, which can be used instead of the High Gain Antenna. As the spacecraft revolves, the crew can maintain communication by manually selecting whichever Omni is facing Earth. Additionally, Mission Control can remotely switch between antennas B and D on the crew's behalf.
0283921|AFJ||As Buzz talks to Mission Control, music can be faintly heard in the background each time he keys his microphone. Your lowly editor had determined that the crew are listening to 'Angel of the Morning' by Merrillee Rush and the Turnabouts which was a hit in 1968.
0284231|AFJ||Image measurement and triangulation suggests that four photographs are taken around this time.
0292000|AFJ||There are no communciations with Apollo 11 for 50 minutes, while the crew have lunch. In the next chapter, they resume viewing the Earth as the spacecraft rotates in Passive Thermal Control mode.
0293214|AFJ||The Apollo 11 stack is currently in its barbecue roll mode, more formally known as Passive Thermal Control. This is in order to distribute the heating effect of the Sun and the cooling effect of space across the spacecraft's exterior. The rate of rotation is 0.3&deg; per second and this was set up using a value stored in the computer. According to McCandless, this value, and another for the deadband (the allowed tolerance in attitude before active correction occurs), both have been set to low values due to the crew using another program. Normally, this would cause the RCS thrusters to fire frenetically as they react to the new parameters. Specifically, the spacecraft would be made to stop rotating and then hold its orientation within a narrow tolerance (probably &plusmn;0.5&deg;). However, at this time, the thrusters have been disabled so the spacecraft will continue to rotate.
0294000|AFJ||Based on image measurement and triangulation, it appears that AS11-36-5362 is taken around this time.
0300000|AFJ||The PAO announcer will shortly correct his figure for the distance from Earth, these figures being referenced to the Moon.
0300000|AFJ||Apollo 11 has passed the halfway point in its journey in terms of distance and the Public Affairs Officer has corrected his error. Readers may note that an Earth-referenced velocity is different to a Moon-referenced velocity. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is coasting towards a moving target - the Moon.
0301705|AFJ||At 010:59:29, Mission Control read up a set of abort PADs that could be used at various points during the coast out to the Moon to bring the crew home expeditiously. The data in these PADs would be used by program 37 to calculate the details of the burn. The names for the PADs were given with reference to TLI and and the first of those opportunities has already passed. Each PAD included a value for Delta-V<sub>T</sub> which is the total required change in velocity to make a safe return at that time. Having recently burned a midcourse correction manoeuvre, the Delta-V values for the remaining PADs have changed slightly.
0302755|AFJ||The crew begins to transmit television signals, even though they do not currently have the High Gain Antenna deployed. Therefore, when the signal from the current omnidirectional antenna reaches Earth, it is very low level and therefore noisy. Although the image is quite broken and torn, it is clearly showing the green displays from one of the CM's DSKY units.
0303006|AFJ||Buzz is referring to the numbers that are appearing on the DSKY's seven-segment displays.
0303301|AFJ||Over the coming minutes, more television is transmitted to Earth. These two clips, kindly provided by Mark Gray, do not currently have any reference to the mission clock so are presented as is. The first shows little except a few frames of Mike. The second is mostly taken through one of the windows looking at the top of the LM, its overhead window and the external element of the Alignment Optical Telescope.
0303301|AFJ||In this next television transmission, still via an omni antenna, the crew attempt to show their exercise routines.
0305432|AFJ||The TV transmission ends.
0305432|AFJ||Another TV transmission begins at about 030:58 though still via an omni antenna.
0310352|AFJ||TV transmission ends.
0310526|AFJ||Mission Control has the ability to switch between omni antennae B and D remotely.
0310526|AFJ||At some point during the last hour and a half, three photos, AS11-36-5363 to 5365, are taken out of the left rendezvous window looking at the docking target on the LM.
0310526|AFJ||Meanwhile, Earth photography continues and based on image measurement and triangulation, it seems that three photos of Earth are taken around this time, AS11-36-5366 to 5368.
0311030|AFJ||Columbia begins transmitting TV again at about 031:10:30. This is mostly of Earth at the long end of their zoom lens.
0311328|AFJ||As the spacecraft rotates, the presentation of the current omnidirectional antenna changes. Although there are four such antennae spaced around the periphery of the CM, adequate coverage can be achieved with just two on opposite sides.
0311437|AFJ||TV transmission ends.
0311933|AFJ||One of the major components of the guidance system is the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This basketball-size piece of kit contains a platform that is stabilised by gyroscopes. This carries a set of three orthogonally-mounted accelerometers. The gyroscopes resist any change in the orientation of their rotation axis and when this happens, they generate an error signal that can be used to return them to their starting point. The gimbals within which the platform is mounted are motorised to achieve this. But the process is not perfect and even the best mechanical gyroscope stabilising system is prone to a small amount of drift in its orientation. For this reason, Mike makes regular checks comparing the platform's alignment with the stars to ensure it is orientated just as it ought to be.
0311933|AFJ||Accelerometers on the platform measure changes in the spacecraft's velocity that are due to any kind of propulsive impulse; mostly engine burns. They do not measure changes brought about during free fall, when the spacecraft is on a ballistic path. An accelerometer will also suffer from slight imperfections in its ability to measure and this usually appears as a small bias in its output that can be compensated for.
0322750|AFJ||Mike has realised that as the spacecraft continues to rotate in its barbecue roll, it will come upon the correct roll angle required for the TV transmission quite naturally. Pitch and yaw are already correct. This attitude will allow the HGA to directly face Earth as well as making the planet visible in one of their large windows. Additionally, from an earlier exchange, he knows that the computer's deadband tolerance is narrow and that the roll rate for the barbecue mode is zero. The spacecraft is only still turning because the thrusters have been disabled. Therefore if he re-enables the thrusters as they reach a roll angle of 261&deg;, then the computer should bring them to a stop at near enough the correct attitude.
0322750|AFJ||One problem with this arrangement is that the jet firings are uncoupled. That is, a rotation might be initiated by a single thruster but the direction of that thrust does not act through the spacecraft's centre of mass. Therefore some of the force acts to rotate the spacecraft, but some acts to translate the spacecraft (i.e. like a propulsive manoeuvre) and this affects the trajectory.
0324323|AFJ||Based on image measurement and triangulation, three photos of Earth appear to have been taken around this time, AS11-36-5369 to 5371.
0325227|AFJ||Mike Collins is sending us this description from about 126,000 [nautical] miles [233,300 km] from Earth.
0325402|AFJ||Another pair of photos of Earth, AS11-36-5372 and 5373, have been taken, this timing being based on image measurement and triangulation.
0333750|AFJ||Sir Bernard Lovell (1913-2012) was a British physicist who established a radio astronomy in Cheshire, England, where he arranged the construction of what was then the world's largest steerable radio telescope that now bears his name, the 76.2-metre (250-foot) Lovell Telescope. During the early years of space flight, Lovell and his team often tracked spacecraft on their journeys to the moon and planets, on occasion intercepting image transmissions and helping to have them published before the craft's own agencies had done so.
0335911|AFJ||This scheduled TV transmission begins with a view out of the window at Earth, but with the zoom lens set to wide angle. This clip is presented in the journal courtesy of Mark Gray.
0340703|AFJ||Eidophor was a video projection system that was used in Mission Control for one of the large display screens at the front of the MOCR. It used a slowly rotating disk on which was deposited a film of oil. A scanning electron beam wrote the TV image onto that oil film, causing it to become transparent in some areas. Light was then shone through the film on its way to a screen, as in a conventional projector.
0340812|AFJ||The Thunderbirds are the formation aerobatic demonstration squadron of the US Air Force.
0341635|AFJ||To further decode the DSKY display, the Verb number, 06, means 'please display the decimal values...' and and Noun number, 51, means 'the High Gain Antenna angles'. These are then displayed with a precision of hundredths of a degree. In this case, the angles are plus 27.82&deg; in pitch, and plus 272.41&deg; in yaw.
0341745|AFJ||Duke's rainbow refers to the colours that become visible on the TV picture when the content moves across the field of view at speed. They are an artefact of the way that the camera works. At the moment, the camera is being moved about at speed.
0341745|AFJ||In order to save weight in the TV camera, its designers used just one imaging tube whereas a conventional colour TV camera of the time had three (or even four) tubes, one each to image the three primary colours; red, green and blue (and maybe one for fine detail) simultaneously. Having just one imaging tube meant that the three colours were imaged sequentially by rotating a filter wheel in front of the sensor. In this arrangement, each television field (of which there were 60 per second) represented the analysis of the scene in red, then blue, then green, over and over. When the signal reached Earth, engineers would pass it through equipment to reconstruct a full colour signal from these fields. A disadvantage of this was that if anything moved quickly across the field of view, then the separate colour analyses would become visible.
0342052|AFJ||Buzz is having fun with the concept of weightlessness. He does some mock push-ups facing the top of frame, then turns over and does more facing the bottom.
0342722|AFJ||CWG is Constant Wear Garments, essentially what they wear around the spacecraft when not wearing their suits. It is also used as an undergarment for the suit.
0343039|AFJ||The conversion of the spacecraft's sequential colour TV signal to composite colour as used by the TV networks was convoluted. The analogue TV systems at the time were very intolerant of timing errors on the signals and those from the fast-moving spacecraft were particularly excessive. The solution adopted was to record the incoming TV signal onto a broadcast-quality quadruplex videotape recorder. The take-up reel was replaced by a looping system which provided a buffer of tape before it was then fed to a second videotape machine. The first machine was locked to the synchronising pulses in the spacecraft's TV signal. The second was locked to a master clock at the TV electronics site on Earth. Having sorted out the timing issues, a magnetic disc system was used to temporarily store the sequential colour fields so that they would be read out available simultaneously and thereby put together into a standard composite TV signal.
0343450|AFJ||TV transmission ends.
0343658|AFJ||Impurities in the oxygen and hydrogen reactants for the fuel cells can build up and impair their operation. They are purged from the cells by flowing either of the gases at a high rate across the cell reaction surfaces.
0343716|AFJ||Day 2 continues in the next chapter with spacecraft maintenance activities, Flight Plan updates and an experiment.
0344600|AFJ||About now, it appears that another photo of Earth is taken, based on image measurement and triangulation.
0351422|AFJ||The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a small contingency burn in case the crew decide not to enter lunar orbit. Instead, the burn would set the spacecraft on a precise trajectory for return to Earth.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 62,815 pounds (28,492 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> +0.97&deg; and -0.20&deg;. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine. In this very short burn, the spacecraft's control system will not have an opportunity to make any further adjustment.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 70 hours, 54 minutes, 59.44 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -2.8 (-0.85); y, +2.3 (+0.7); z, +6.9 (+2.1). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 269&deg;; Pitch, 149&deg;; Yaw, 312&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable. If this abort burn were to be made, the apogee of the resulting orbit would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> 22.1 nautical miles (40.9 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects the Earth's atmosphere. What this really means is that the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 7.8 fps (2.4 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 1 second.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 3.4 fps (1 m/s). Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the engine in case the G&amp;N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, is slightly lower than Delta-V<sub>T</sub> because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 1 (Alpheratz, Alpha Andromedae) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 218.5&deg; and 22.7&deg; respectively. This is part of an attitude check.<br> <b>Boresight star:</b> Not available. This is a second attitude check which is made by sighting on another celestial object with the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight).<br> The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. Another important point is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g's.<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 2.65&deg; south, 165.0&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.<br> <b>Range to go:</b> 1,189.9 nautical miles (2,203.7 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after Entry Interface.<br> <b>Expected velocity at Entry Interface:</b> 36,228 fps (11,042 m/s).<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 144 hours, 56 minutes and 47 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft would be at 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are the north set, Deneb and Vega. The align angles are roll, 7&deg;; pitch, 144&deg;; yaw, 68&deg;.<br> The PAD includes some additional notes. The SPS propellant tanks are full, so there would be no need to perform an ullage burn to settle their contents. The burn details assume the LM is still docked and the attitude values are based on the guidance platform being aligned per the PTC REFSMMAT.]
0351753|AFJ||Verb 16 Noun 20 will reveal the current gimbal angles from the IMU, essentially the spacecraft's attitude in hundredths of a degree with respect to the current REFSMMAT. Noun 22 is for new angles so it seems he is to copy the current angles into a slot for new angles.
0352013|AFJ||Verb 50 Noun 18 means please perform an automanoeuvre.
0352808|AFJ||The McDonald Observatory is part of the University of Texas at Austin. It is located 260 kilometres southeast of El Paso. After Neil and Buzz place a retroreflector on the Moon, the McDonald Observatory will be used to use laser pulses to establish the Earth/Moon distance with exquisite accuracy.
0352849|AFJ||The telescope is only a one-power device whereas the sextant will magnify 28 times.
0353707|AFJ||The shaft and trunnion angles are to allow the high-power sextant to be aimed directly at the laser's source. The one-power telescope, on the other hand is really a wide-field device.
0355826|AFJ||The computer has 2Kwords of erasable memory to which Mission Control can request access.
0362700|AFJ||The PAO announcer would appear to be referring to this video clip.
0362700|AFJ||Based on image measurement and triangulation, it appears that about now, another photo of Earth is taken, AS11-36-5375.
0372100|AFJ||This concludes the second day of the flight of Apollo 11. The crew will now be out of radio contact with Mission Control for more than 11 hours.
0481948|AFJ||It is actually the spacecraft meter that is reading low, but the readings from the sensors are also radioed to Earth and can be read by Mission Control on the ground. MCC can apply a more sophisticated analysis of the telemetry from the engine to generate a more accurate reading of chamber pressure when compared to the relatively crude meter in the spacecraft.

0604546|AFJ||The crew have noticed an unexplained flashing object out of the window, which appears to be catching the sunlight as it tumbles. Neil is wondering whether it is the abandoned third stage of the Saturn launch vehicle.
0604914|AFJ||The answer from Mission Control indicates that the mystery object is highly unlikley to be the S-IVB stage, given its great distance from Apollo 11. Although the object's identity was never resolved, it is quite possible that it is one of the SLA panels which covered the Lunar Module during launch.

0691314|AFJ||GOSS is the Ground Operational Support System.
0715600|AFJ||They are currently about 19,000 km from the Moon. The Moon's diameter is 3,474 km. At their current distance, its angular diameter is about 10 degrees. In comparison, the Sun's angular diameter as seen from the Earth or Moon is about 0.5 degrees.
0715635|AFJ||McCandless may be trying to use mental arithmetic to convert two lunar diameters to its equivalent in solar diameters. The correct answer is about 40 solar diameters.
0715652|AFJ||The outer parts of the corona are known as the F-corona and represent sunlight reflected by interplanetary dust particles. In the plane of the ecliptic beyond roughly 40 solar radii, it is often called zodiacal light. At that distance, it is about 500 times fainter than the inner parts of the corona visible from the ground during a total solar eclipse. What Neil is reporting out as far as two lunar diameters (80 solar radii) may be light coming from the outer F-corona. See <a href="http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/5006_07/50060493.pdf" target="new">Brightness of the Solar F-corona (PDF)</a>

0764137|AFJ||High pressure nitrogen gas is used to actuate the valves that feed propellant to the SPS engine. During the burn, engineering data from the spacecraft was recorded on the DSE tape recorder. this data, along with crew voice recordings is played back to Earth on an auxiliary radio channel as soon as the spacecraft comes back into view.
0771251|AFJ||Aristarchus is the brightest crater on the face of the Moon.
0774334|AFJ||This appears to refer to the monocular.
0782745|AFJ||At this point in the air-ground recording, the Flight Director's microphone finds its way onto the recorded audio.
0782857|AFJ||Mike is flying the stack in 'orb-rate' so that the windows stay facing the Moon as they go around. In this mode, the angle between the spacecraft and the flight path is called 'theta' and is similar in concept to an aircraft's pitch angle. However, there is a phenomenon called gravity gradient stabilisation whereby a spacecraft with an uneven mass distribution (the CSM and LM being a pretty good example) will eventually align itself with its long axis radial to the planet it is orbiting.
0783732|AFJ||Crater KAMP is not a formal lunar feature name. Rather, it was named by Mike who planned to use it as a navigational landmark much as Jim Lovell used Mount Marilyn for a peak near the crater Secchi. KAMP honours Mike's family, being the initials of his three children and his wife: Kate, Ann, Michael and Patricia. The Foaming Sea, Mare Spumans, is on the eastern limb of the Moon as viwed from Earth.
0784412|AFJ||To flesh Neil's story out a little more, although Michiel Van Langren was one of the first telescopic mappers of the Moon, almost every name he gave to its surface features failed to stick. Much of the Moon's major nomenclature is attributed to Giovanni Riccioli and only one name has survived from Van Langren's map, the self-named major crater Langrenus.
0794828|AFJ||Phil Shaffer was Flight Dynamics Officer. He died in 2007. The eccentric orbit post-LOI-2 was done to compensate to some extent for the lunar mascons. The hope was that by making it eccentric in the first place, it will circularise itself by the time of rendezvous with Eagle's ascent stage.

0814821|AFJ||A sneeze is heard on the voice recording.
0815040|AFJ||Since Aldrin and Armstrong have spun around 180 degrees to assume the correct orientation on entering the LM, from their perspective the CM is also 'up'!
0815636|AFJ||By 'open the window', Aldrin means remove the window shade.
0823720|AFJ||A-1 probably refers to Apollo Landing Site 1, a site that had been reconnoitered by the Apollo 8 crew. By Apollo 10's launch, managers had decided to go with a site further to the east, ALS-2. It is ALS-2, or a point a few kilometres west of it, that will eventually become Tranquillity Base.
0825530|AFJ||US-1, or U.S. Highway number 1, was the informal name given to Rima Hypatia I, a rille near Moltke. The geological feature looks like a road.

0851419|AFJ||This refers to the Barbra Streisand song 'People', which has the line: 'People who need people are the luckiest people in the world'. It was written by Styne and Merrill for the Broadway musical Funny Girl in 1964. The crew are listening to a cassette recorder as they wind down for their sleep period.
0851635|AFJ||By the phrase 'present time in orbit', the PAO announcer really means the spacecraft's orbital period.
0862018|AFJ||AOS is actually 86:28:15.
0863251|AFJ||This is the end of flight day 4. Communications with Mission Control resume in seven hours, at 93:32:19.
0951728|AFJ||Chang-O is also spelled Ch'ang O and, in the more modern rendition, Chang'e. Change was subsequently adopted as the name of the Chinese unmanned lunar exploration programme, the first spacecraft of which was launched in 2007. The third in the series, Chang'e 3, was the first to land which it did autonomously on 14 December 2013 in Mare Imbrium. The rabbits name of Yutu, stated by Evans as not reported, was given as the name of the first Chinese lunar rover, delivered to the surface by Chang'e 3 and it translates to 'Jade Rabbit'.
0953027|AFJ||The crew now re-start the oboard voice recorder.
0964619|AFJ||This means on Armstrong's channel.
0981450|AFJ||The Lunar Module's four landing legs have deployed to the open position with a bang, and the talkback indicator on the instrument panel has turned grey, as confirmation.
0981526|AFJ||The PAO recording at this point does not include the air-ground signal and only has the output from the PAO announcer's microphone. This configuration is maintained until about 098:24:50.

0982634|AFJ||130 is the designation number of tracking landmark crater on the lunar surface they intend to use.

0984603|AFJ||In fact, Armstrong had reported this about 20 minutes earlier, at 98:27:46, but Mission Control did not acknowledge it.
0984738|AFJ||The LM crew are pressurising the LM RCS tanks by firing explosively actuated valves which allow helium gas into the tanks where it acts on bladders that contain the propellant.
0985545|AFJ||John Young was Command Module Pilot on Apollo 10, two months earlier, and he had tested the navigation and tracking procedures for Apollo 11.
0992916|AFJ||Apollo 11 now passes out of radio contact behind the Moon. When on the far side they will un-dock, and re-emerge as two separate spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle.
1001200|ALSJ||On Apollo 10, 11, and 12, prior to LM separation, the crews put the Command Module/Lunar Module combination into a circular orbit 60 nautical miles above the lunar surface. When the LM crews were ready for the descent, they separated from the Command Module. The accompanying 16-mm film clip shows the Apollo 11 separation as seen from the Command Module and then a full rotation around the LM thrust axis that Neil and Buzz executed so that Mike could do a visual inspection. The LM crew then performed a Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI burn) over the middle of the Farside in order to put themselves into a 60 by 9 nautical mile orbit. They would start the Powered Descent from the low point of that orbit.
1001200|ALSJ||Beginning with Apollo 14, the sequence of orbital procedures was modified so that the DOI burn was performed with the CSM Service Propulsion engine prior to LM separation. This change preserved LM fuel. Readers should note that the crews thought of the low-point in this orbit as being 50,000 feet and not 9 nautical miles.
1001200|ALSJ|CDR|There was a necessity to land heavier weights on later flights, so they did a number of things to allow a maximum landing weight.
1001200|ALSJ||Because of the DOI burn, the Apollo 11 LM, Eagle, is in an orbit with a shorter period than is the Command Module, Columbia. In detail, the LM orbit is about 4 minutes shorter and, because they have completed about a quarter of an orbit, relative to the lunar surface, the LM is about a minute ahead of the CSM. However, because the Command Module is in a higher orbit, it comes into view of Earth at an earlier stage in its orbit than does the Lunar Module. Specifically, the Command Module is visible about 6 minutes before reaching the east limb while the LM - which is currently at an altitude of about 15 miles - comes into view about 3 minutes prior to limb passage. In summary, Eagle is about a minute ahead of Columbia, but Columbia has a three minute line-of sight advantage. The net result is that, if all has gone well with the burn, Mike Collins in Columbia will regain radio contact with Earth about two minutes before LM AOS (Acquisition of Signal).
1001200|ALSJ||Charlie Duke, the CapCom for the landing, calls about 10 seconds after Houston acquires the Command Module. AOS of the Command Module carrier signal comes at 102:14:52, with voice contact coming nearly a minute later. The delay in making voice contact is due to the need to get antennas on the spacecraft properly aligned.
1002201|AFJ||Two cameraman are in the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) to film the events. Courtesy of journal contributor Stephen Slater, these clips, which were filmed mute, have been synchronised with the air/ground audio and, where appropriate, the Flight Director's loop.
1003016|AFJ||Collins means 9 minutes, 30 seconds until his engine firing which will separate the CSM from the LM.
1010309|AFJ||The error is Mission Control's, not that of Collins.
1011630|AFJ||Two cameraman are in the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) to film the events.
1013031|AFJ||While the PAO announcer has his microphone keyed, a voice in the background can be heard counting down, '3, 2, 1...'.
1014554|AFJ||He is pitching the Lunar Module forward so that the engine thrust axis is correctly aimed for PDI when they arrive at their perilune. This will be about 500 km east of the landing site.
1020551|AFJ||It is actually 27:20 to the PDI burn. This may be a mistranscription.
1021600|AFJ||Being in a higher orbit, Columbia regains contact with Mission Control first. Eagle is now flying faster in its lower descent orbit, dropping towards the surface. Although somewhat closer to Earth than Columbia, Eagle is more closely hugging the surface and remains hidden behind the Moon for almost two minutes longer.
1021600|ALSJ||Both spacecraft are equipped with high-gain antennas which must be pointed accurately at Earth to maintain top-quality communications. Because the Command Module attitude relative to Earth changes as Mike maneuvers so that he can track the LM, the antenna must be moved to maintain pointing. However, the system of gimbals used to point the antenna has physical limits and Houston is telling Mike that, at some point during the descent, one or more of those limits will be reached. In order to re-acquire the high-gain, Mike would have to change the spacecraft attitude and, because he can maintain voice communications with both Earth and Eagle on his omni-directional antennas and because Houston will be pre-occupied with the landing, no attitude adjustment will be made.
1021600|ALSJ|CDR|They are referring to the strength and clarity of the signal on a scale of five. 'Five by five' meant 'loud and clear.
1021729|AFJ||Having now re-acquired signal, first from Columbia then from Eagle, Mission Control starts to monitor closely the Eagle's continuing descent, leading up to engine re-ignition as it approaches the landing site. The flight transcript continues in the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, first chapter.
1021736|ALSJ||David Woods writes, "In this case, there has obviously been a large burn. They would like the burn to achieve a particular result in terms of velocity change (delta-v) in the three axes. In most cases. a single engine burn will fail to precisely achieve the required change of velocity - there will usually be a small under or over performance of the engine. The differences between the desired and achieved delta-v across the three axes are called the 'residuals'. For some (not all) burns, the crew are to use the RCS thrusters to bring the three residual values of delta-v to zero or null, essentially making up the deficit or cancelling the overperformance of the main engine to achieve a perfect result. This is called 'nulling the residuals'. However, it is often desirable for the engineers to know what the residuals were before they were taken out - 'before nulling'. This probably gives insight into the performance of the system."
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|If the burn had been perfect, the computer would have displayed residuals in the three body-axes of 0, 0, 0. If there was some deviation, it was displayed to a tenth of a foot (per second). Apparently, we were supposed to null X and Z (the vertical and fore/aft axes, respectively). They didn't care about Y (left to right). The way they were nulled was (by firing the RCS) with the handcontroller. Neil was looking at them, and I was looking at them and I recorded them.
1021736|ALSJ||The spacecraft's X <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a> coincides with the thrust axis, with the positive direction being up - away from the engine toward the rendezvous hatch. The Z <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a> runs fore and aft, with the positive direction being out the windows. The Y <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a> runs left to right, with the positive direction being on Aldrin's (right) side of the spacecraft. By nulling the X and Z residuals, they are trying to avoid landing long or short of the target. They are ignoring the small north/south error.
1021736|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> is the Abort Guidance System, the backup navigation system used primarily for an emergency return to orbit. The Primary Guidance and Navigation System provides more information and will be used during the landing. The two systems are cross-checked prior to descent; and close agreement between them gives confidence in both.
1021736|ALSJ||The LM computer takes actions designated as Verbs, while Nouns are data. The PGNS and AGS both integrate accelerations to estimate the spacecraft velocities. The PGNS uses data from the inertial platform and the AGS uses less accurate data from body-mounted accelerometers.
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|Somewhere, we had a state vector (three-axis position and velocity) update because of the tracking data that Houston got once we came around. But, how that happened and whether we were aware of it, I don't remember. I know that a lot of people got credit for developing the tracking filter that allowed them to do that. That neat capability contributed to the accuracy of our touchdown, even though nobody knew (exactly) where we were.
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|I was less concerned about the state vector than I was about inertial platform drift. It had been a fair amount of time since we had last aligned the platform and, in time, it was going to drift. This sun check, here, was a gross check on platform drift. During the half orbit before DOI we rotated (the LM) to make the sextant look directly at the Sun and looked to see if it was in the crosshairs. I think that, to within some predetermined limits, some fraction of a degree, it was alright. The platform was drifted slightly, I think (0.08 degrees); but not enough to worry about.
1021736|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld writes: " The predetermined limit for this gross check on platform drift was 0.25 degrees. There was quite a bit of controversy about the usefulness of this and other 'confidence builders' and they were discontinued for the later Apollos. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/BennettFV_Bio.pdf" target="alsj">Floyd Bennett</a>, of NASA's guidance section (for whom Bennett Hill at the Apollo 15 site is named), thought that, in planning the descent, they were far too pessimistic in assessing the performance of the whole guidance and navigation system. The drift check, checks of the altitude by tracking the Command Module with the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/rendradar.jpg" target="alsj">rendezvous radar</a>, etc., caused more problems, and cost more time and money than was warranted by a slight gain in confidence. Bennett's Apollo Experience Report (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-descent.html" target="alsj">NASA TN D-6846</a>) discusses they way in which the landings and ascents were planned, and is one of the best of the series."
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|We did landmark checking to check our position over the ground, and that was another check on the state vector.
1021736|ALSJ||Neil's double-paned window has <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdin.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">scribe marks</a> on both panes in the form of graduated vertical and horizontal scales, marked in degrees. During the landing, these scales will give Neil the means of locating the point on the ground where the computer thinks they are going to land. However, during this period before Powered Descent Initiation, Neil uses the scribe marks to determine how quickly objects on the surface move along the scale and, consequently, the LM's current altitude. Crudely, the LM altitude (in thousands of feet) is 360 times the radius of the Moon (in thousands of feet) divided by the LM's orbital period (in seconds) and, finally, that result divided by the tracking rate (in degrees per second). As an example, if we use a lunar radius of 5700 thousand feet and a LM period of 7200 seconds, the LM altitude (in thousands of feet) is 285 divided by the tracking rate (in degrees per second). In detail, the tracking rate as a function of position along the orbit depends not only on the spacecraft altitude but, also, on the shape of the orbit. As Buzz indicates in the next paragraph, he and Neil have a chart in the cabin on which Neil can compare tracking rates with expected values at various positions along the orbit; and differences between the observations and the expected values allow him to estimate the altitude of the low-point in his orbit - called perilune - and the time at which they will reach it. See his comment two paragraphs below.
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|We had two methods of computing altitude: one based on relative motion from the CSM and the other based on angular rate track of objects observed on the ground. We superimposed the two of them on one graph and re-arranged the graph a little bit with some rather last minute (pre-flight) data shuffling to give us something that the two of us could work on at the same time and to give indication of what the altitude and its time history appeared to be. With the communications difficulties that we were experiencing in trying to verify that we had a good lock-on (with Earth) at this point, I had the opportunity to get only about two or three range-rate marks (on the CSM). They appeared to give us a perilune altitude of very close to 50,000 feet, as far as I could interpolate them on the chart.
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|The measurements against the ground course were indicative of altitude directly above the ground. The ground measurements were very consistent. If they made a horizontal line, it would indicate that you were going to hit a particular perilune (say) 50,000 feet. They (the actual measurements) didn't say that. They were very consistent (that is, they didn't jump around), but they came down a slope, which finally said that our perilune was going to be 51,000 feet. It started out at about 54,000 feet...and our last point was 51,000 feet. This indicated that either the ground was sloping (which it wasn't)...or that the line of apsides (the line connecting the high and low points in the orbit) was shifted a little bit (from its planned position). So, actually, perilune was coming a little bit before PDI...This was all very encouraging - that we were, in fact, going to hit the guidance box (an imaginary window in the sky) so far as (perilune) altitude was concerned from both (the radar and ground tracking) measurements. But I was quite encouraged that these (ground) measurements, made with the stopwatch, were consistent (that is, followed a smooth trend), in fact.
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|When you're able to smooth the numbers and plot a reasonable number of them, your accuracy increases considerably. I think the pre-flight estimates were something on the order of a 6000-foot capability; and I think we demonstrated a much better capability than that.
1021736|ALSJ||The LM computer tracks the signal it receives via the high-gain antenna and corrects the pointing to maintain maximum signal strength. The computer program which maintains proper pointing also contains a 'map' of the LM so that it can use information about the spacecraft orientation and, thereby, avoid trying to 'see' Earth through the spacecraft. Unbeknownst to anyone at this point in the mission, the computer has an incorrect LM map.
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|I think that, later, they put in a five degree <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">yaw</a> (a rotation around the thrust <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a>) so that the high gain wasn't working so close to the spacecraft, so near its limit."
1021736|ALSJ||Houston will recommend a 10 degree right (clockwise) yaw maneuver at 102:27:22.
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|When we were looking at something on the computer, they could see it, too. So the verbal report was just added confirmation.
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|Of course, they couldn't get anything when we were out of the line-of-sight, and had to rely on our (post AOS) reports. I don't think they had any ability to store that (post-burn) information in the computer.
1021736|ALSJ||The LM computer has only a very limited memory, so data that is no longer of use is not kept.
1021736|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes, "Verb 47 is the command used to initialize the Abort Guidance System (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a>), using PGNS data".
1021736|ALSJ||The crew is in the Push-to Talk communications mode and we only hear them when they chose to broadcast to Houston.
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|There were switches on the handcontroller and on the electrical connector that went to the suit. I was using that one because I would have gotten my hand slapped if I had touched the controller.
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|It was a fairly simple procedure to send a state vector from one computer (the PGNS in this case) to the other (the AGS).
1021736|ALSJ|LMP|The AGS initialization was done by a Verb, an instruction with maybe a two- or three-digit code (Verb 47, as noted above).
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|At the time, there were inertial guidance systems in aircraft, using inertial platforms. But the computations usually had an altimeter-based smoothing input into the Earth-radius measurement so that the calculation of position was stable. The error would oscillate but wasn't like the error in three dimensions which is unstable and will continue to build. So, although aircraft had similar devices, the calculations were different. Aircraft didn't have anything like the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a>, because I don't think the accuracy would last very long."
1021736|ALSJ|CDR|The visual check was something that we devised ourselves, barnyard math of v = r w. 'r' would be your altitude (that you wanted to know), omega (w) was your angular rate that you determined by watching a point on the ground, and the velocity (v) was pretty well known. We measured omega by measuring the speed at which an object on the ground passed through a certain number of degrees on the (<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="alsj">LPD</a>) grid on the window. We just timed it on a stopwatch and had a little plot to compare it with. As the altitude decreased, we could see it was converging pretty well. It gave us an alternate check of our altitude. The importance of this is that, if we weren't in a reasonably close altitude band to our intended starting altitude, the landing guidance would not necessarily converge - the solution wouldn't converge - so it was important to us at that point that the altitude be about right when we started."
1021736|ALSJ||500 series codes were reserved for radar-related computer functions.
1022714|ALSJ|CDR|We'd have to have a half day in that simulator, again, to remember some of these things.
1022714|ALSJ|LMP|We spent a lot of time in the LM trainer - maybe 30 or 40 percent of our time - but there was a lot in the CSM (trainer) and on other things. Your sense of well-being is generated by the degree of familiarity you have with what might go wrong in a challenging way. To me, when you're doing what we were doing for the first time, there's a level of importance that's a good bit different from the second or third time, because it has been done already and because the world has seen it. When you're part of the pioneering effort, there's a focusing of an individual's concentration and level of attention that is at the exclusion of a lot of other things. It's a kind of gun-barrel vision.
1022714|ALSJ||The 15 July 1969 <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Crew Training Summary</a> indicates that out of 959 hours of training, Neil spent 285 hours - 30 percent - in the various <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">LM simulators</a>. Buzz did 1017 hours of training, of which 332 hours - 33 percent - was spent in the LM simulators. These figures do not include Neil's LLTV flights nor the 56 hours each of them spent in briefings about LM systems.
1022714|ALSJ|CDR|I would add, along that same line, that the time requirements necessitated that we accept the conclusions and recommendations of the crews that went before us. So, we did not spend an extraordinary amount of time on things that had already been done and had worked as expected. We focused a great deal of our attention on those things which had not been done before and which we would be expected to pass on to the crews behind us.
1022714|ALSJ|LMP|Whether they wanted it or not.
1022714|ALSJ||NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-35504.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-35504</a> shows Neil, Mike and Buzz debriefing the Apollo 10 crew on 3 June 1969, about a week after Tom Stafford, John Young, and Gene Cernan returned from the Moon. Clockwise from the near left, the people around the table are Collins, Aldrin, Cernan, Stafford, Armstrong, and Young.
1022714|ALSJ|CDR|We did have one program alarm...prior to ignition, that (indicated) we had the radar out of position...a 500 series alarm...which I don't have any way of accounting for. Certainly the switches were in the right positions. They hadn't been changed since pre-launch. But we did, in fact, go to the Descent position on the antenna and leave it there for a half a minute or so, and then go back to Auto and that cleared the alarm.
1022714|ALSJ||O'Brien - "The landing radar could be moved between two positions: Before pitchover, the radar was in the Descent position, and as the LM rotated to a more upright attitude during the approach phase, the radar was moved to the Hover position. These positions could be commanded manually, in addition to the Auto setting, where the radar was under the control of the guidance computer. The purpose of moving the radar was to keep the antenna pointed as directly towards the surface as possible."
1022714|ALSJ||This <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">yaw</a> maneuver is a ten degree clockwise rotation around the axis that extends out through the forward hatch <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a>. Houston is trying to put the high-gain antenna in a position where interference from the spacecraft structure will be reduced.
1022818|ALSJ||They are five minutes from the planned Powered Descent Initiation. Starting at about 102:27:50, Flight Director Gene Kranz asked members of his <a href="http://honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_11_mission/a11_White_Team.html" target="alsj">White Team of Flight Controllers</a> for a Go/No Go for Powered Descent: RETRO (Retrofire Officer, determined LM engine burn times and aborts); FIDO (Flight Dynamics Officer, planned, monitored, and adjusted the flight path as required); GUIDANCE (Guidance Officer, responsible for the on-board navigation Systems and guidance computers); CONTROL (responsible for LM control systems); TELMU (Telemetry, Electrical and EVA Mobility Officer, monitored LM electrical and environmental control systems); GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Systems Engineer, monitored all vehicle guidance, navigation, and control systems, and the RCS systems); EECOM (pronounced 'e-com', Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager); Surgeon. They all responded Go'.
1022818|ALSJ||Neil is not on voice activated comm (VOX) but, rather is in Push-to-Talk (PTT), squeezing a comm switch when he wants to be heard in Houston. Here, we hear him faintly through Buzz's comm circuit.
1022908|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Neil is supposed to change his rate-scale switch from 5 degrees per second to 25 degrees per second but, for some reason, does not make the change. This procedural error will cause problems when Neil rolls the LM into a face-up orientation at 102:36:46."
1022908|ALSJ||David Woods and Frank O'Brien (<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap15fj/12day5_landing_prep.html#1042152" target="alsj">A15FJ</a> at 104:21:52) write, "Command Override is a shorthand for 'Descent Engine Command Override', which will allow either pilot to assume control of the descent engine's thrust using the Thrust/Translational Hand Controllers, if required.&quot:
1022938|ALSJ||David Woods and Frank O'Brien (<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap15fj/12day5_landing_prep.html#1042152" target="alsj">A15FJ</a> at 104:21:52) write, "Attitude control gives control over Roll, Pitch and Yaw rotations to the computer. So when he says 'three of them', he is referring to the three switches that control this mode."
1022938|ALSJ||Danny Ross Lunsford calls our attention to the likelihood that Buzz is referring here to 'Engine Arm, Descent', which occurs at 102:32:50.
1022938|ALSJ|LMP|Standing by for engine arm descent.
1022938|ALSJ||I hear the final word as 'arming' but, given the frequency with which Buzz's transmissions are clipped, I recognize the distinct possibility of alternate transcriptions after 'Standing by for'. Indeed, the slight pause after 'for' could be a clipped syllable or word.
1023045|ALSJ||Gary Neff has produced two versions of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landmov.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 landing film</a>. The longer of two starts here and covers 15 min 59 seconds. The shorter version starts at 102:34:24.
1023045|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien pulled Buzz's transmission out the noise. "'Verb 77' may make some sense here, as it is setting attitude control modes for the Digital Autopilot."
1023104|ALSJ||This is the 16-mm movie camera mounted in Buzz's window. See Gary Neff's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.orient.html" target="alsj">discussion</a> of the Apollo 12 landing film.
1023104|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that we only had one film cartridge and that we intended to run that all we could during the descent, at as close to regular speed as we could. I don't remember what the time limitation on those cartridges were.
1023104|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that six DAC magazines were transferred to the LM prior to undocking.
1023104|ALSJ|LMP|During present Shuttle missions, when things get kind of boring for the flight controllers, they delve back into history and put up on the screen things like five minutes of Apollo 11 EVA or three and a half minutes of the powered descent. Somebody spent an awful lot of time synchronizing film from the cameras that were in the mission control room with the views out our (LM) window that the sequence camera took. It's really neat! It's listed in the Public Affairs Office's Mission Minutes.
1023104|ALSJ||Mike Caplinger, systems engineer at Malin Space Science Systems for the Mars Descent Imager onboard the Mars Polar Lander writes " The Apollo 11 Lunar Module carried a 16-millimeter Maurer Data Acquisition Camera. The camera was used to record the descent, ascent, and some surface operations."
1023104|ALSJ||Lotzmann - "The LM camera was fitted with an 10-mm wide-angle lens. The 10-mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 54.9 degrees and a vertical field of view of 41.1 degrees. The lens was manufactured by Kern in Switzerland The camera was mounted above the right-hand window, looking forward and down."
1023104|ALSJ||The Apollo 11 LM also carried a second DAC body, apparently without a lens. The spare camera body was stowed in the ancillary bag in the CDR's checklist pocket stowage container. During the post-EVA jettison operation, the spare DAC body was offloaded along with the ancillary stowage bag.
1023104|ALSJ||Caplinger - "The Maurer camera weighed 2.8 pounds with a 140-foot, thin base film magazine attached. It had frame rates of 1, 6, and 12 fps in 'automatice" mode and 24 fps in semi-automatic mode, at all lens focal lengths, and shutter speeds of 1/60, 1/125, 1/500 and 1/1000 second, again, at all lens focal lengths. At one fps, a 140-foot 16mm magazine would have a maximum run duration of about 93 minutes. During the descent of Apollo 11, the camera was activated at 102:31:04 MET and the landing occurred at 102:45:47 MET, for a total duration of 14m 43s. From page 3-68 of the Apollo 11 Flight Plan, the camera was set to 6 fps (max. run duration 16 minutes), infinity focus. So the amount of film was just barely sufficient to record the descent. I assume that the magazine was changed prior to the EVA."
1023104|ALSJ||Ulli Lotzmann writes: "In Automatic mode, the sequence (or framing) rate can be changed from 1, 6 to 12 fps without interrupting the cameras operation. In the semiautomatic mode the frame rate (24fps) cannot be changed without switching the camera off."
1023114|ALSJ||During the remainder of the Descent, only Buzz is on Vox and Neil is heard only occasionally in Houston. However, his comments to Buzz on the LM intercom were recorded onboard and that record has been used in constructing the following.
1023303|ALSJ||They are flying with engine forward and windows down. After they finish landmark tracking to confirm their trajectory during the first few minutes of the powered descent, they will yaw the spacecraft (a rotation around the thrust axis) to put themselves in a windows-up orientation. This will be done so that, as the spacecraft pitches toward an upright orientation for the landing, they will be looking out the windows at the landing site. At 102:36:11, in the onboard comm, Neil says they've passed over the crater Maskelyne W about three seconds early and, therefore, will be landing long. In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/Tindallgram_19690924.pdf" title="image" target="alsj">24 September 1969 memo</a>, Howard Tindall discussed factors which make pinpoint landings difficult. He cited "thrust from the LM water boiler" resulting in a 6,000 foot miss distance, or about 1/4 of the 4 miles by which Apollo 11 overflew its target. Readers should note that Paul Fjeld is doubtful about this conclusion. He writes: "The vent for the sublimators was angled up to a deflector which should have sprayed the gas evenly with little net thrust to the spacecraft. As far as I can find out, the design for the vent was never changed for the later, accurate LMs."
1023303|ALSJ||For Apollo 12 and the later flights, trajectory corrections will be read up to the crew during descent.
1023303|ALSJ|CDR|We measured the position of certain prominent landmarks at a couple of points prior to ignition and then after ignition. Once that was finished, we did a 180-degree yaw (to the face-up position) so that the radar could see the surface. My recollection is that the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LMRadars.html" target="alsj">landing radar</a> wasn't really reliable above something like 30,000 feet. They had tried it on Apollo 10 (at 50,000 feet) to see if they could get altitude readouts, and we did try to use it (at that altitude) to get some measurements. We wanted to do that while we were still up at a reasonable altitude to help the guidance equation converge. The timing (of the 180-degree yaw) was a balance between seeing the surface and getting the radar information in the guidance solution."
1023303|ALSJ||In his excellent book, </i>How Apollo Flew To The Moon<i>, David Woods tells us that, when Neil arms the descent engine, two indicator lights on the DSKY come on indicating that the landing radar is not providing adequate data to calculate the LM altitude and rate of descent. Later in the descent, when they get close enough to the surface that the radar is getting good data, those lights will go out.
1023303|ALSJ||Ten percent thrust means that the Descent Engine is generating ten percent of its maximum design power level of 10,500 pounds.
1023303|ALSJ|CDR|One reason for using ten percent thrust had to do with the guidance strategy. The engine would run at ten percent until the guidance perceived that you were at the proper geometric position to go to full thrust. It allowed the computer to make a distance correction. In other words, it would accelerate from ten percent to full thrust within some time window. If it did it earlier, why, of course, that would bring the target closer to you; and if it did it later...
1023303|ALSJ||Fjeld -"The LM Guidance Computer would calculate the ignition time for the correct distance, start the engine after 7 seconds of ullage and keep to ten percent thrust for exactly 26 seconds, a quantity the programmers called 'Zoomtime'. Within this period, the very slow Roll and Pitch gimbal drives would be able to trim the thrust through the center-of-mass, after which - as the programmers would say - the 'Flatout' call to 'Burnbaby' would be made. The timing of throttle-down and the following thrust and pointing commands corrected for errors in distance or position."
1023303|ALSJ|LMP|Do you recall what the thrust level was for DOI? Was it ten percent all the way?
1023303|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that it was.
1023303|ALSJ||During DOI, they ran the LM engine at 10 percent thrust for 15 seconds and then increased to 40 percent for the remaining 15 seconds.
1023303|ALSJ||That is, Houston wants Eagle to use the aft omni-directional antenna.
1023303|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Buzz's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/sband.jpg" target="alsj">S-band antenna</a> pointing switch is in manual (Slew) so he can dial in the antenna pitch and yaw angles directly. To do so, he has to turn to his right, away from the flight controls and computers, to the side panel where all the comm stuff is. The Rendezvous Radar mode dial also has a Slew setting."
1023424|ALSJ||Gary Neff has produced two high-quality versions of the Apollo 11 landing film. The shorter of the two starts here.
1023424|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Neil is referring to the Rendezvous Radar mode dial, which is in Auto Track and has been since he and Buzz did a post-DOI ranging test - another 'confidence builder'."
1023424|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Here, Neil puts the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LMRadars.html" target="alsj">Rendezvous Radar</a> mode switch in Slew - an action that leads to the Program Alarms and accompanying excitement in the landing. Because the dial is not set at LGC (computer control), once they start getting radar data, the computer will be continuously interrupted with useless (and false) 'warnings' that the radar's CSM tracking angle has changed. The computer will get overloaded five times during the descent and, later, this leads Neil to decide not use the computer for re-targeting the landing site. There was post-flight controversy about the possibility that Neil had made a mistake here, but I think the Crew Procedures Division, misunderstanding or using bad information from MIT, trained the crew that way."
1023621|ALSJ||In a post-mission analysis, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-descent.html" target="alsj">Apollo Descent and Ascent Trajectories</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/BennettFV_Bio.pdf" target="alsj">Floyd Bennett</a> notes that, at PDI, Eagle was about 3 miles farther downrange than planned, due to "small delta-V inputs to the spacecraft state in coasting flight. These inputs were from uncoupled RCS attitude maneuvers and cooling system venting not accounted for by the propagation of the predicted navigates state at PDI."
1023621|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ron Wells calls attention to discussions in Gene Kranz's </i>Failure is Not an Option<i> which attribute the positional error at PDI to residual pressure in the tunnel between the LM and CSM at undocking at 100:12:00. In a 2002 e-mail, Kranz elaborates, "Floyd's note was correct on the velocity-induced position error at the start of the descent. There were several interrelated navigation problems, i.e. known deficiencies in the R2 lunar (gravitational) potential model, down-track (along the flight path toward the landing site) and cross-track (left or right, perpendicular to the flight path) propagation errors (errors that start out small but become larger as the flight proceeds), and errors induced by maneuvering of the spacecraft. The principal error induced by maneuvering of the spacecraft was, however, the incomplete vent of the tunnel propagated over one orbit after separation. We made a change in all future missions to get a MCC go-nogo on tunnel delta P before giving the crew a Go to undock. Page 82 of the Apollo 11 post mission report says ....'because of uncoupled attitude maneuvers such as hot fire tests, undocking impulse, station keeping, sublimator operation and possible tunnel and cabin venting. The net effect of these perturbations was a sizeable down-range miss.' To my recollection, the trajectory reconstruction determined that with the exception of the tunnel venting, most of the other perturbations were essentially self canceling. Further the post mission review indicated that the delta P gauge was too gross, the markings misleading and the tunnel had to be vented earlier in the timeline and the valve left in the tunnel vent position rather than returned to off."
1023621|ALSJ||And, finally, Hamish Lindsay, author of </i>Tracking Apollo to the Moon<i> notes that imperfect knowledge of the effects of mascons (mass concentrations) may have also contributed. In 2006, Hamish consulted with Jerry Bostick, who served as Flight Dynamics Officer on Gene Kranz's White Team. Bostick tells us, "It's one of those things that is hard to definitely prove one way or the other, but my opinion is that it was a combination of the tunnel pressure and us not completely understanding - being able to accurately model - the mass concentrations."
1023621|ALSJ|CDR|We ended up three miles long.
1023621|ALSJ|LMP|I think it's pretty remarkable that, this early in the burn, we could estimate that. Good guess.
1023621|ALSJ|CDR|We picked a number of landmarks (to look at) while we were still in the face-down mode.
1023621|ALSJ|LMP|I appreciate the 'we'. But you did (the tracking), because I wasn't looking out the window. I could care less about the landmarks. If it wasn't in the AGS or the DSKY, (then Buzz didn't see it).
1023621|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> is the Abort Guidance System. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#DSKY" target="alsj">DSKY</a> is the Display and Keypad, used by the crew to communicate with the LM computer.
1023621|ALSJ|CDR|Our downrange position appeared to be good at the minus 3 and minus 1 minutes points (prior to ignition). I did not accurately catch the (time at the) ignition point because I was watching the engine performance. But it appeared to be reasonable, certainly in the right ballpark.
1023621|ALSJ||David Woods writes, "I think he was hoping to catch the exact time of ignition by taking a glance at the mission clock at the ignition point but it appears he was looking at the engine gauges so intently that he missed his opportunity."
1023621|ALSJ|CDR|Our crossrange (north/south) position was difficult to tell accurately because of the skewed yaw attitude that we were obliged to maintain for comm. However, the downrange position marks after ignition indicated that we were long. Each one that was made indicated that we were 2 or 3 seconds long in range. (That is, they were reaching landmarks 2 or 3 seconds early. One second corresponds to about a mile of miss distance.) The fact that throttle down essentially came on time, rather than being delayed, indicated that the computer was a little bit confused at what our downrange position was. Had it known where it was, it would have throttled down later (to kill a little velocity). Landmark visibility was very good. We had no difficulty determining our position throughout all the face-down phase of powered descent. Correlating with known positions, based on the Apollo 10 pictures, was very easy and very useful.
1023621|ALSJ||Neil's landmark tracking indicated that they were going to land about 3 miles (4.8 km) beyond the center of the landing ellipse. As can be seen in the flown copy of LAM-2 that Mike had in the CM, the "Last Bst Pos prior L/O/", which is very close to the actual landing site, they landed about 6.6 km (4.0 miles) long. About 0.6 km of the difference is due to the fact that Neil has to take manual control and fly beyond the boulder field surrounding West Crater. The landmark tracking method available to Neil was far from precise, so the remaining difference is not signficant.
1023621|ALSJ||The PGNS, pronounced 'pings', is the Primary Guidance and Navigation System.
1023646|ALSJ||Neil is about to yaw the vehicle to a face up, feet forward position. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Yaw</a> is a rotation around the LM thrust <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">axis</a>.
1023646|ALSJ||Kipp Teague, referring to the audio clips provided by Colin Mackellar and linked at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html" onClick="window.open('A11_landing_NC_and_FD.mp3','popup audio','height=315,width=560,left=0,top=0,screenx=0,screeny=0'); return false">102:13:55</a>: "This is a very unusual audio clip of the lunar landing featuring a thought-to-be-lost segment. It's in 'stereo' because the Flight Director loop is on the left channel and air-to-ground audio is on the right channel."
1023703|ALSJ|CDR|The yaw around (to the right) was slow. We had inadvertently left the rate (scale) switch in 5 (degrees per second) rather than 25, and I was yawing at only a couple of degrees per second as opposed to the 5 to 7 that we had planned. The computer would not hold this rate of, say, 1 to 2 deg/sec. It was jumping up to 3 degrees and back, actually changing the sign and stopping the roll (means 'yaw') rate (as can be seen in the descent-and-landing film). It was then that I clearly realized that we weren't rolling as fast as was necessary and I noted that we were on the wrong scale switch (position). So I went to 25 and put in a 5-deg/sec command and it went right around. However, this delayed it somewhat and, consequently, we were in a slightly lower altitude at the completion of the yaw around than we had expected to be, so we were probably down to about 39,000 or 40,000 feet (altitude) at the time we had radar lockup - as opposed to about 41,500 that we expected to be.
1023703|ALSJ||The landing film shows a noticeable increase in the yaw rate at about this point.
1023703|ALSJ|LMP|I can't ever recall having them exercise us in the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">simulator</a> with the uncertainty of intermittent comm. It was distracting. In simulator training, either things were working normal, or there was something going wrong. It would have a degree of polarity to it. It either was or wasn't (working). But the uncertainty, particularly in communications, that was exhibited here, was frustrating. You didn't know where you were - whether you were on your own, or whether you were still under the close supervision of ground control. And that sort of reality is rarely simulated in training. And it was a forerunner of the computer alarms which further distracted me from my task, which was one of monitoring the computers and other instruments. You need some continuity when you're doing that. The whole reason for the whole litany (of readouts) that was coming from me was so that Neil didn't have to look at all the stuff. But, when something unusual starts happening so that we both have to appraise the situation, it's diverting."
1023703|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, there was a certain amount of manual tracking being done at this time with the S-band (high-gain <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/sband.jpg" target="alsj">antenna</a>). During the initial parts of powered descent, the Auto track did not appear to maintain the highest signal strength. It dropped down to around 3.7 (versus a maximum of 5.0) and the ground wanted re-acquisition, so I tweaked it up manually. I got the impression that it was not completely impossible to conduct a manual track throughout powered descent. You'd not be able to do very much besides that. I think it would be possible to do, if you had sets of predetermined values that you could set in. We did have the S-band pitch and yaw angles immediately following the yaw maneuver...After the yaw, the S-band appeared to have a little bit better communications."
1023703|ALSJ||They have yawed around far enough that the lunar surface in no longer visible in the 16-mm film shot out Buzz's window.
1023703|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrt5-I.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Table 5-I</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566.pdf" title="pdf document" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a> gives the time of landing radar lock-on as 102:37:51. The 13-second difference between that time and the transcript time of Buzz's call indicates the size of errors that can occur in transcript times.
1023703|ALSJ||The fact that the altitude light is out means they are now getting good radar returns from the lunar surface. "Delta-H is minus 2900" means that the radar altitude is 2900 feet lower than the PGNS altitude.
1023820|ALSJ||They have yawed to the right (a clockwise rotation around the thrust axis) to the windows-up position and, evidently, Buzz has glanced up from his computer. Note that the 16-mm capture is pointing down from above Buzz's window and the Earth is not captured in the film.
1023820|ALSJ|LMP|There's no doubt, in listening to that, that that was my voice. But when I heard it, I figured that 'Well, Neil must have seen that, he was looking out the window.
1023820|ALSJ|CDR|We were still pretty level when we rolled over. Earth was twenty-three degrees west of the zenith, so we would have been looking right up at it.
1023820|ALSJ||As indicated in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-5.gif" title="image" target="alsj">Figure 5-5</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mr.html" target="alsj">Mission Report</a>, the LM pitch is about 77 degrees. A pitch of 90 degrees would have them flying with their back parallel to the lunar surface and their feet forward. Once they are down on the surface, they will be at a pitch near zero. During the next three minutes, they will slowly come more upright, reaching a pitch of about 56 degrees just prior to entering P-64.
1023820|ALSJ||Fjeld - "At the end of the yaw maneuver, you can really see in the descent film how dramatic the propellant slosh problem is becoming. As the propellant level gets to near fifty percent, there is more room for the fluid to swirl and slosh yet still enough mass for that movement to really torque the LM out of its tight deadband. This is the reason that there is much more thruster activity than Neil has been expecting. In the absence of slosh, slow gimbaling of the engine would be keeping them level. The effects of the sloshing reaches its peak right about here, with the spacecraft wiggling 2 to 3 degrees back-and-forth and side-to-side every couple of seconds. Later, more seriously, the spacecraft motions caused by slosh will render the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="alsj">LPD</a> essentially useless and then, at 102:44:45, will cause the propellant low-level sensor to latch nearly 30 seconds early."
1023820|ALSJ||They have switched to a data readout which shows Houston the difference between their altitude as determined by the radar and the inertial estimate provided by the PGNS.

1023832|ALSJ||Altitude 33,500 feet. In the 16mm film record, the lunar surface can be seen in the very bottom of Buzz's window. As indicated in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-5.gif" target="alsj">Figure 5-5</a> in the Mission Report, the LM is pitched back about 77 degrees at this time but will start coming noticeably more upright between now and P64.
1023832|ALSJ||The 1202 program alarm is being produced by data overflow in the computer. It is not an alarm that they had seen during simulations but, as Neil explained during a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PostFlightPressConf.html" target="alsj">post-flight press conference</a> "In simulations we have a large number of failures and we are usually spring-loaded to the abort position. And in this case in the real flight, we are spring-loaded to the land position."
1023832|ALSJ||David Woods has provided scans of pages <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/A15LMCueCardsp15.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">15</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/A15LMCueCardsp16.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">16</a> from the Apollo 15 Lunar Module Cue Cards, which cover various abort scenarios. On page 16, for a return to orbit using either the descent engine (lefthand column) or the ascent engine (righthand collumn), Then Neil would check the position of the Guidance Switch and then push either the Abort button or Abort Stage button, respectively.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|I clearly must have said this, and it strikes me as that it's probably right. At least, it was true for me and I think it was for Buzz. We had gone that far and we wanted to land. We didn't want to practice aborts. So I'm sure that we were focusing our attention on doing what was required in order to complete the landing.
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|In simulations, someone's training you to give a certain response. So you want to do the right thing in the simulation. When it's not a simulation, you want to do the right thing to get the mission done.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|In the simulations we challenged the procedures and exercised the procedures and put all the participants - in the control center and in the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">simulator</a> - in position of having to make fairly rapid and reasonable judgments in the situation that occurred."
1023832|ALSJ||David Wood's suggests the possibility that '330' has to do with a comparison of, say, the radar's determination of height versus the Guidance and Navigation system's estimate. It is not a typo for 'P30', which is a program for setting up a burn.
1023832|ALSJ||In Houston, Steve Bales, the control room's expert in the LM guidance systems, has determined that the landing will not be jeopardized by the overflow. The overflow consists of an unexpected flow of data concerning rendezvous radar pointing. The computer has been programmed to recognize this data as being of secondary importance and will ignore it while it does more important computations. In my first draft of this paragraph, I described Bales as "a young expert".
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|I don't doubt that Steve was a 'young expert' (he was 26), but Steve probably wasn't much different in age than most all of the other guys in the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room).
1023832|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Stephanie Hanus notes that Gene Kranz describes in his book </I>Failure is Not an Option<I> the final simulation done prior to the mission, with Dave Scott and Jim Irwin in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">LM simulator</a>. That landing simulation was aborted - unnecessarily - by Mission Control because of a 1201 program alarm.
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|There had been some training - in a sim(ulation) that Fred Haise (the Apollo 13 LMP) was part of - where some things similar to this had come up, and Kranz instructed his people to go back and look at these sort of things. But, as best I can recall, whatever the flight director people had known about this alarm potential coming up and which were Go and which were not, I was the kind of the systems guy in the LM and I was not made aware of that. And it seems as though that was a flaw in communications. I was very much in the dark when this came up.
1023832|ALSJ||The Apollo guidance software was developed at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts under the direction of Margaret Hamilton. In September 2003, NASA recognized <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Hamilton.html" target="alsj">Hamilton's contribution</a> with a NASA Exceptional Space Act Award.
1023832|ALSJ||Perspectives on the 1201/2 alarms and other guidance computer issues are provided by <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html" target="alsj">Fred Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-pa.html" target="alsj">Peter Adler</a>, and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/http://www.klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm" target="alsj">Don Eyles</a>. Eyles and Adler discuss the programming issues invovled in some detail.
1023832|ALSJ||That is, they will reduce thrust 6 minutes 25 seconds into the burn.
1023832|ALSJ||O'Brien - "The code 16/68, to which Buzz refers, is the computer display Verb 16 Noun 68. This displays the range to the landing site, the time remaining in the braking phase - essentially, the time remaining before pitchover - and the LMs velocity. This display does not place a particularly heavy load on the computer, but when added to the existing load, was sufficient to generate the 1202 alarm."
1023832|ALSJ||Altitude 21,000 feet.
1023832|ALSJ||The current <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mr5_5.gif" target="alsj">LM pitch</a> is about 59 degrees.
1023832|ALSJ||O'Brien - "The high-gain S-Band antenna could be steered two different ways: in Slew mode, the antenna could be re-positioned (slewed) manually, or in the Auto mode the computer would keep the antenna pointing towards the Earth regardless of the LM attitude. Buzz is telling Houston that since the antenna is currently being pointed manually (due to the earlier communications problems), it will not be pointing correctly after pitchover. He wants to try the Auto setting again to see if the computer can now keep the antenna pointing correctly. This works successfully."
1023832|ALSJ||The S-band antenna is shown in close-up in a LM-9 <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/sband.jpg" target="alsj">photo</a> by Randy Attwood.
1023832|ALSJ||Altitude 16,000 feet.
1023832|ALSJ||Neil probably has begun to see some of the lunar surface at the very bottom of his window.
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|We had two different fuel monitoring systems, and these guys were going to tell us which was more accurate in their judgment.
1023832|ALSJ||Altitude 13,500 feet.
1023832|ALSJ||Buzz wants to know when the computer will switch from P63 to P64. Because pitchover occurs when P64 starts, I was probably 'spring-loaded' (Neil's phrase in the commentary following <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1024544" target="alsj">102:45:44</a>) to hear 'pitchover' rather than 'switchover' when I was preparing digital versions of the Air-to-Ground transcripts prior to the mission review done with Armstrong and Aldrin in 1991. So I changed the digital transcript from 'pitchover' to 'switchover'. That mistake persisted until 2014 when David Woods was preparing material for the Apollo 11 Flight Journal and told me that he thought Buzz had said 'switchover'. I listened to the audio, sent my thanks to David by e-mail, and eliminated the error.
1023832|ALSJ||O'Brien - "At 102:39:14, Buzz determined that many of the 1202 alarms could be avoided if he did not request the computer to display the time remaining before pitchover (Noun 68), and their first view of the landing site. Rather than risk further computer problems, he is asking Houston to provide that information."
1023832|ALSJ||The computer has just initiated the Approach Phase program, P-64, and the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mr5_5.gif" target="alsj">LM pitch</a> has decreased rapidly from about 55 degrees to 45 degrees. The spacecraft will continue to rotate upright and will be at a pitch of about 20 degrees when Neil takes manual control to overfly <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-08.jpg" target="alsj">West Crater</a>.
1023832|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrt5-I.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Table 5-I</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566.pdf" title="pdf document" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a> gives P64 starting at 102:41:32. The error in the transcript time of Neil's call is small.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted a check that we were getting response from the handcontroller before we were irretrievably committed to it. I think (that), like control-stick steering, you could (intentionally) overpower the autopilot and, if you let go, it would go back (to autopilot). We're in P64 and we just probably exercised the handcontroller to check its response like control-stick steering, and then just released the handcontroller and it went back to the (computer) commanded attitude.
1023832|ALSJ||Fjeld - "The PGNS Mode-Control toggle switch has to be moved from Auto to Att Hold (Attitude Hold) for Neil to manually command attitude rates to the Digital Autopilot (DAP). He does this after the P-64 pitchover to test his controls, then pushes the toggle back up to Auto so that the DAP will follow Guidance attitude commands. I think Neil was supposed to have done this before P64 so he could use all his time evaluating the landing site and redesignating a new one if necessary. The change may have been another consequence of the computer alarms."

1023832|ALSJ||GoneToPlaid has created a ground track (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_Ground_Track_GTP.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5 Mb</a>) displayed on the LROC overlay in Google Moon. Points are labeled with time (mm:ss) before the landing and many are labeled to indicate key calls from the crew.

The error in the transcript time of Buzz's call is small.
1023832|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdin.jpg" target="alsj">window</a> in front of Neil is scribed with vertical and horizontal scales. The scales is marked in degrees. Buzz is reading a computer display which indicates where on the vertical scale Neil should look to find the place where the computer thinks the LM will land.
1023832|ALSJ||Randy Attwood has provide a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdin.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photo</a> of the LPD scale in LM-9, the H-mission-capable vehicle scheduled for Apollo 15 before that flight became a J-mission.
1023832|ALSJ||During the other Apollo landings, pitchover gave the Commanders their first looks at the landing site. Then, they could re-target the LM using the Landing Point Designator (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="alsj">LPD</a>). If they twitched the handcontroller forward, the computer would move its target downrange by a small increment and similarly to the right, left, or uprange.
1023832|ALSJ||Fjeld - "One blip of the handcontroller moved the target 1/2 degree up/downrange or 2 degrees left/right per blip. The increments were all changed to 1 degree for Apollo 15 and the later flights."
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|Normally, in this period of time - that is, from P64 onward, we'd be evaluating the landing site and checking our position and starting <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdin.jpg" target="alsj">LPD</a> activity. However, the concern here was not with the landing area we were going into but, rather, whether we could continue at all (because of the program alarms). Consequently, our attention was directed toward clearing the program alarms, keeping the machine flying, and assuring ourselves that control was adequate to continue without requiring an abort. Most of the attention was directed inside the cockpit during this time period and, in my view, this would account for our inability to study the landing site and final landing location during the final descent. It wasn't until we got below 2000 feet that we were actually able to look out and view the landing area."
1023832|ALSJ||Readers should note that only Neil is looking out the window. As mentioned previously, Buzz has his attention focused entirely on the computer. Neil's use of 'we' in this context is consistent with his general tendency to deflect attention from himself, even in situations like the Technical Debrief where the only people present were his crewmates, other astronauts, and various engineers.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|In the early phases of P64, I did find time to go out of Auto control and check the manual control in both pitch and yaw and found its response to be satisfactory. I zeroed the error needles and went back into Auto. I continued the descent in Auto...We proceeded on the flashing 64 and obtained <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="alsj">LPD</a> availability, but we did not use it because we really weren't looking outside the cockpit during this phase. As we approached the 1500-foot point, the program alarm seemed to be settling down and we committed ourselves to continue. We could see the landing area and the point at which the LPD was pointing, which was indicating we were landing just short (and slightly north) of a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-08.jpg" target="alsj">large rocky crater</a> surrounded with the large boulder field with very large rocks covering a high percentage of the surface. I initially felt that that might be a good landing area if we could stop short of that crater, because it would have more scientific value to be close to a large crater. (However), continuing to monitor the LPD, it became obvious that I could not stop short enough to find a safe landing area."
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html target="alsj">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a> - "This crater was later identified as one we had informally called West Crater during our prelaunch training."
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|Tracking information indicated that Neil had flown past the middle of the landing ellipse and was several kiometers downrange. We knew that he had flown over a blocky-rim crater, that he had seen rays of ejecta as he passed over, and that the landing pattern (ground track?) had been rather like a fish hook. There were maybe six craters which could fit his description, but once we knew he was downrange we narrowed it to two. I believe that it was (geologist) Marita West, over in Building No. 2, who first suggested that the crater Neil had described was West Crater. All of us came to the same conclusion pretty rapidly.
1023832|ALSJ||As Neil will discuss at 102:55:16, the boulder field surrounding West Crater contains rocks up to 2 to 3 meters in size, big enough to cause the LM some real problems. On a detail from a 300 dpi scan of a Xerox copy of 1:5000 LM Lunar Surface Map <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-lse248det.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LSE 2-48</a>, I have marked what is probably a boulder just east of West Crater. The grid squares on this 1:5000 map are 50 meters on a side and the north-south size of the boulder is about 1-2 meters and close to the resolution limit.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that the outer northeast slope of West Crater is where it was taking us.
1023832|ALSJ||Fjeld - "On the main, vertical index line of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdex.jpg" target="alsj">LPD</a>, hash marks are painted at 2 degrees intervals. Lesser increments have to be eyeballed. Use of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lpdex.jpg" target="alsj">LPD</a> was tough enough with even a stable platform, but the LM has been in a constant slow pitch since P64 and the LPD numbers Neil is getting from Buzz are as much as 2 seconds old. In addition, one to two degree per second motions caused by propellant sloshing is making use of the LPD, I believe, futile! Post-mission analysis showed that the actual computer target is more than 500 feet west/northwest of where Neil thinks the LM is taking him."
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|If you don't like what you see, there are maybe four classes of alternatives: left, right, down (short), or go over. And, overwhelmingly, the less traumatic one is to go over, even though there may be some question 'Well, if I go over, then I don't know where it is.' Whereas, if I land short of it, then I know where it is. I'm not on it, I'm in front of it. As I try to reconstruct it, going right is a hairy thing, going left is a hairy thing, and coming down and stopping (short)...since, to stop, really...
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|You got to go dead...You can't see very well...
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|And you might drive yourself into a...You know, it's just a bad deal.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|You might get down there and find out 'Jesus, I've got a terrible situation.'
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|Right. Right. So the easier, the much more natural (thing to do) is to easily fly over.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|Extend it.
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|Where, in retrospect, that's the one that eats up more fuel. I would suspect that Pete and the rest of the guys coming along afterwards paid a lot more attention to thoughts of fuel consumption than we did.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|Probably.
1023832|ALSJ||Post-flight analysis indicated that Neil landed with about 770 pounds of fuel remaining. Of this total, about 100 pounds would have been unusable. As indicated in an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrfp9-24.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">unnumbered figure</a> from page 9-24 in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566.pdf" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a>, the remainder would have been enough for about 45 seconds, including about 20 seconds for an abort. Naturally, Neil had no intention of aborting.
1023832|ALSJ||The mission plan had PDI at 102:35:13 and the landing at 102:47:11, for a total burn of 11 minutes 58 seconds. In reality, PDI was at 102:33:07 with the landing at 102:45:41. The burn lasted 12 minutes 34 seconds, 36 seconds longer than planned, with virtually all the difference due to Neil's decision to fly beyond the boulder field. The longer burn was equivalent to using roughly 530 pounds of fuel. Had Neil not landed long, he would have had about 1190 of usable fuel remaining. The other five Commanders all landed with roughly 1100 to 1200 pounds of usable fuel remaining.
1023832|ALSJ||O'Brien - "The large difference between the post-flight analysis and the critical, low-fuel situation that appeared to exist - but didn't - was due to fuel sloshing in the tanks. As Neil pitched the LM over to fly past the crater, the propellant-quantity measuring devices could not accurately gauge the amount left in the tanks."
1023832|ALSJ||Fjeld - "At the time of Apollo 11, each of the tanks had a small cruciform baffle near the anti-vortex can at the base, right next to the hole for the Propellant Quantity Gauge. Studies were done, early in LEM development, with a clear plastic tank half full that revealed that the slosh dynamics were not too severe and that the small vortex baffles were sufficient to keep propellant slosh at bay.
1023832|ALSJ||Well, we all know what happened on Apollo 11. Slosh uncovered the Quantity Gauge, latching the light early, losing the crew half a minute of flight time. It also made the LPD unreliable. Apollo 12 flew with the same configuration and its Quantity light came on early, exactly the same way! Worse, Pete actually used the LPD to redesignate his landing, but he maneuvered <b>away</b> from his target because the slosh was messing up his view through the grid. He popped out of P64 and tried to slam on the brakes but it was too late (Gosh! I went by it!"), so he had to make his heroic flight around the crater, scaring Al a bit. He would have been better off never using the LPD, letting the flight path settle out, switching to manual just before the crater, and landing at his 'parking lot', uprange and north of the crater!
1023832|ALSJ||Engineers rigged high-rate telemetry on the propellant quantity gauge for Aquarius to get data on the slosh dynamics; but, of course, Apollo 13 never delivered this precious data. So Grumman engineers rigged an ingenious tank test and discovered that, not only did the tanks slosh in ring mode and lateral mode, but did so in a plunger fashion as well. It was a very complex situation, but they were able to come up with a <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/AntiSloshBaffles.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">baffle design</a> that would reduce sloshing to an acceptable level. However, with a solution in hand, how were they going to put big baffles in propellant tanks that were never going to be rebuilt - because the contractor responsible had gotten out of the business by then? The answer was: Ship-in-a-Bottle style.
1023832|ALSJ||At White Sands, two Grumman techs <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/AntiSloshBaffleInstall.jpg"title="image" target="alsj">demonstrated</a> assembling and welding(!) a complex baffle system through the two inch Quantity System hole. NASA and Grumman management were seated around them for the demonstration and when the techs succeeded, they stood and cheered. So Antares had the baffles first and Ed Mitchell remarked how smooth and quiet the early part of the ride was (no RCS bangin')."
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|Did you ever train on one where if you had some rates and you wanted to get rid of 'em...I mean, you could almost, I would think, be flying down and decide that you want to go somewhere, do it manually and, instead of even trying to stop the rates yourself, just give it back and let the computer stop. Try that in training and see if it works.
1023832|ALSJ|CDR|If you'd become accustomed to that in training, you might have used that mode if it felt comfortable. It's kind of like using cruise control on a car. You know, if you're used to using cruise control on a car, you're probably going to use it a lot more than the guy who doesn't normally use it. So I think that's probably a fair observation. But since we really hadn't had practice in doing it that way, I probably didn't gravitate to it.
1023832|ALSJ|LMP|I suspect that ten (or) fifteen years from now, a bunch of guys are going to sit around and argue the same damn things over again. And they may even be doing it single stage to orbit and landing powered descents here on Earth and have a lot of these same concerns.
1023832|ALSJ||O'Brien - "It is interesting to note that switching back and forth between manual and computer control became significantly easier in later versions of the LM guidance software. In Eagle, Neil had to physically switch the guidance control out of automatic, manually adjust his trajectory, and if he wanted to - which he didn't - physically switch the computer back to automatically control of his descent. Even then, Eagle's computer was programmed only to adjust the vertical component of the descent, leaving the control of horizontal velocity to the crew. On later versions of the software (first available on Apollo 15, but see below), simple deflection of the handcontroller would allow manual control, and when the controller was released, the computer resumed control over the descent. A further enhancement was automatic control of the descent in both the vertical and horizontal planes, easing the workload on the Commander."
1023832|ALSJ||Fjeld - "After Pete Conrad's struggles during Apollo 12 to keep his horizontal rates nulled, MIT came up with an enhanced P66 which let the pilot bounce back and forth between automatic and manual horizontal nulling and between semi-automatic rate-of-descent and fully-manual throttle control. That meant that there were now four unique ways to fly the LM to touchdown. However, the result of all this great re-design work was never tried by any of the Commanders who had the capability. They all flew just like Neil, except that they learned to use the LM shadow. I think Frank O'Brien's Apollo 15 comment refers to a fabulous P66 design that Don Eyles of Draper Labs wanted to incorporate into the later landings but was never allowed to."
1023832|ALSJ||GoneToPlaid has prepared a labeled <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11landing02m43sGTP.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">comparison</a> between the view out Buzz's window captured by the DAC at about 102:42:57 (2 min 43 seconds before the landing) and a similar view made from the LROC overlay in Google Moon, using the known ground track and a detailed LM model.
1024315|ALSJ||As indicated in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrt5-I.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Table 5-I</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566.pdf" title="pdf document" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a>, at 102:43:22, Neil takes over manual control, going into P66.
1024315|ALSJ|CDR|We then went into Manual and pitched the vehicle over to approximately zero pitch (thereby slowing the descent) and continued.
1024315|ALSJ||The sudden response of LM can be seen in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-5.gif" target="alsj">Figure 5-5</a> from the Mission Report. When Neil takes manual control, he changes the vehicle pitch from about 18 degrees to about 5 degrees. Gary Neff notes that <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-6.gif" target="alsj">Figure 5-6</a>, which presents the pitch and roll information for the final phase is mis-labeled. The titles of the two charts are reversed. The top chart actually shows pitch angle and the bottom chart shows roll angle.
1024315|ALSJ||As can be seen in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-6.gif" target="alsj">Figure 5-6a (top)</a>, what Neil later described as "approximately zero pitch" is actually about 6 degrees, which he holds until about 102:43:40 when he starts increasing the pitch toward 16 degrees once he has overflown West Crater.
1024315|ALSJ||GoneToPlaid has prepared a labeled <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11landing02m18sGTP.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">comparison</a> between the view out Buzz's window captured by the DAC at about 102:43:25 (2 min 18 seconds before the landing) and a similar view made from the LROC overlay in Google Moon, using the known ground track and a detailed LM model.
1024315|ALSJ||This is Buzz's first verbal report of forward velocity. Because Neil has the LM pitched at only 6 degrees, the forward velocity is higher than would normally have occurred at this point in the descent and Buzz may simply be calling attention to the situation. Buzz cannot see West Crater and can only judge what is going on from the computer readouts and the cross-pointers.
1024342|ALSJ|CDR|I didn't (use the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="alsj">LPD</a> to) redesignate. By this time I was flying the machine manually out to the west. That's indicated when Buzz says 'We're pegged on horizontal velocity.' I had tipped it over like a helicopter and was going out to the west."
1024342|ALSJ||Neil's statement that he 'tipped it over like a helicopter' can give the impression that he tipped the LM forward, past vertical. However, both Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-5.gif" title="image" target="alsj">5-5</a> and the mis-labeled upper half of Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mrFig5-6.gif" title="image" target="alsj">5-6</a> indicate that, after reducing the LM pitch to about 5 degrees - still a backwards tilt, but just short of vertical - at 102:43:20 to slow his descent rate, he maintained that pitch until he was clear of the crater. By 102:43:40, he was getting clear and began tilting the LM back to slow his forward speed.

1024342|ALSJ|LMP|
1024342|ALSJ||O'Brien (from 2005 e-mail) - For readers not knowing the cross-pointer scale change, would be easy to assume that Neil has really cranked over the LM to zoom past West Crater. I now believe that his actions were far more gentle. Neil reduced the pitch angle to reduce the amount of horizontal braking, so the effect was that he wasn't trying to accelerate over West, he was simply not decelerating."
1024342|ALSJ||At 102:43:26, Buzz gave a computer readout of 58 fps forward velocity, which is a leisurely 64 km/hr. West Crater has a diameter of about 165 meters. Traveling that distance at 64 km/hr would have taken about 9 seconds.
1024342|ALSJ|CDR|I was in the 20- to 30-ft/sec horizontal-velocity region (actually 50 to 60 ft/sec) when crossing the top (north rim) of the crater and the boulder field. I then proceeded to look for a satisfactory landing area and the one chosen was a relatively smooth area between some sizable craters and a ray-type boulder field.
1024342|ALSJ||By 102:43:50, Neil had the LM pitched back at 16 degrees to slow his forward speed. He maintained that attitude until about 102:44:05.
1024342|ALSJ||Until August 2005, I attributed '270' to Neil. However, Danny Ross Lunsford points out that both from the voice quality and the context, it is almost certainly Buzz who said it.
1024342|ALSJ||Buzz's utterance at 102:44:00 has always sounded to me like "Take it down.", in line with his "Ease her down" at 102:43:52. However, Lunsford suggests that the actual words are "Eight percent", which makes more sense from the context. Specifically, Neil has just asked for a fuel reading and Buzz would have been ready to give him one. Indeed, it is extremely unlikely that Buzz wouldn't have done so.
1024342|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld - "Up on the CDR's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_panel01_prplnt_qty_mon.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">main panel beside the timers</a> were two small digital EL (Electro-Luminescent) displays that showed fuel and oxidizer percent remaining. The crew could monitor either set of tanks by pushing the PRPLNT QTY MON switch to DES 1 or DES 2 depending on which was more conservative (Houston would make the call). The LMP would just look over and call out the lowest number."
1024342|ALSJ||With his forward velocity now down to about 20 feet-per-second and the LM approaching a good landing area, Neil quickly reduced the LM pitch to 6 degrees and began the final descent.
1024342|ALSJ|LMP|I would estimate (from the transcript) that I called out that shadow business at around 260 feet, and it was certainly large at that point. I would have said that, at 260 feet, the shadow would have been way the hell and gone out there, but it wasn't. I could tell that we had our gear down and that we had an ascent and a descent stage. Had I looked out sooner, I'm sure I could have seen something identified as a shadow at 400 feet; maybe higher, I don't know. But anyway, at this altitude, it was usable. Since the ground is moving away (that is, there is dust blowing out from underneath the spacecraft), the shadow might be of some aid. But of course, you have to have it out your window.
1024342|ALSJ||As Neil described during the Technical Debriefing (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#yaw13" tartget="new">extract below</a>), during the final stages of the approach, Neil was flying with the LM rotated about 13 degrees to the left and, because of the spacecraft structure over the hatch, the shadow was not in his field-of-view.
1024342|ALSJ||David Woods notes that these indicator lights are immediately above the 7-4-1 key column of keys on the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/LM6-co28.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">DSKY</a>. They indicate that the computer is not getting good radar data. Paul Fjeld adds, "The radar lost track with the surface twice after Neil took over manual control: once nearly a minute into P66 for 20 seconds and then, for a few seconds, about 40 seconds before touchdown."
1024342|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrt5-I.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Table 5-I</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566.pdf" title="pdf document" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a> shows this loss of good landing radar data occuring at 102:44:11.
1024425|ALSJ||The crater Neil mentions is about <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-08.jpg" target="alsj">60 meters east of the spot where he will land</a> and is known as <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="alsj">Little West Crater</a>
1024445|ALSJ||Fjeld - "The quantity light latched at 102:44:31, and indicated that 5.6% of the original propellant load remained. This event started a 94-second countdown to a 'Bingo' fuel call which meant 'land in 20 seconds or abort.' So if the count gets down to zero, Neil will have 20 seconds to land, if he thinks he can get down in time. Otherwise, he will have to abort immediately. If you're 50 feet up at 'bingo fuel' with all of your horizontal rates nulled and are coming down to a good spot, you could certainly continue to land. With your horizontal rates nulled at 70 to 100 feet, it would be risky to land - perhaps giving you a landing at the limiting load of the landing gear. At anything over 100 feet, you'd punch the abort button, say goodbye to the moon, and stew for the rest of your life!"
1024445|ALSJ||The Descent Quantity Light - labeled DES QTY - is one of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM6_C&D_Panel1CW.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Warning lights</a> at the top of Panel 1, which is to the right of the CDR's window. These warning lights are all 'Aviation Red' in color. A group of Caution lights, all in 'Aviation Yellow', are at the top of Panel 2 to the left of the LMP's window. Dave Scott remembers, "We spent considerable time with the contractors defining the color, title, and placement of C&amp;W lights"
1024502|ALSJ||Fjeld - "This is a result of a second, brief radar dropout."
1024502|ALSJ||Neil wants to be moving forward as he lands so that he can be sure of not backing into an unnoticed or forgotten hole behind him.
1024517|ALSJ|CDR|I first noticed that we were, in fact, disturbing the dust on the surface when we were something less than 100 feet; we were beginning to get a transparent sheet of moving dust that obscured visibility a little bit. As we got lower, the visibility continued to decrease. I don't think that the (visual) altitude determination was severely hurt by this blowing dust; but the thing that was confusing to me was that it was hard to pick out what your lateral and downrange velocities were, because you were seeing a lot of moving dust that you had to look through to pick up the stationary rocks and base your translational velocity decisions on that. I found that to be quite difficult. I spent more time trying to arrest translational velocity than I thought would be necessary.
1024517|ALSJ||What Buzz says here is sometimes transcribed as "Faint shadow" but I recently listened, once again, to both the Public Affairs tape and to the onboard tape and feel uncomfortable making a decision, primarily because the transmission is distorted and partially clipped. Buzz first saw the LM shadow when he looked out at 102:44:04, a fact which adds to my discomfort with the usual transcription. In 2006 I listened to the HSK recording of the Net 1 feed from Goldstone and am still not able to make a decision.
1024517|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Perhaps Buzz did say 'Faint shadow' but was referring to the now fuzzy edge of the shadow on the streaking dust layer."
1024517|ALSJ||David Harland suggests a transcription of 'Great shadow', but I still do not believe it is possible to definitively pull this one out of the noise.
1024532|ALSJ|CDR|As we got below 30 feet or so, I had selected the final touchdown area. For some reason I'm not sure of, we started to pick up left translational velocity and a backward velocity. That's the thing I certainly didn't want to do, because you don't like to be going backwards, unable to see where you're going. So I arrested this backward rate with some possibly spasmodic control motions, but I was unable to stop the left translational rate. As we approached the ground, I still had a left translational rate which made me reluctant to shut the engine off while I still had that rate. I was also reluctant to slow down my descent rate anymore than it was, or stop (the descent), because we were close to running out of fuel. We were hitting our abort limit.
1024532|ALSJ|CDR|I guess that, at that altitude, running out of fuel wasn't a consideration. Because we would have let it just quit on us, probably, and let it fall on in.
1024532|ALSJ||Fjeld - "An engine cut-out at any height above 10 feet would have produced a touchdown harder than the landing gear was designed to withstand."
1024532|ALSJ|CDR| target=alsj">interviewed</a> at NASA Johnson by historians Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley as part of the JSC Oral History project. During that interview, Neil said, "I wanted to make it as easy for myself as I could on that first (landing)there's a lot of concern about coming close to running out of fuel, and I was very cognizant of that. But I did know that if I could have my speed stabilized and attitude stabilized, I could fall from a fairly good height, perhaps maybe forty feet or more in the low lunar gravity, (and) the gear would absorb that much fall. So I was perhaps probably less concerned about it than a lot of people watching down here on Earth. That's not to say I wasn't thinking about it, though, because I certainly was, but I thought it was important to try to get it down smoothly on the first try. We didn't know how that landing was actually going to go until that point. So I wanted to make it as gentle as I could."
1024532|ALSJ||In an e-mail response to a question from Journal Contributors Matt Gleason and Larry Jordan, Neil elaborated: "When my eyes tell me I am about 40 feet (12 meters) above the ground, the landing footpads are about 24 ft above the surface. The impact velocity under lunar gravity would be the square root of 2gh (two times the lunar gravitational acceleration {g} multiplied by the height {h}) or about 16 feet/second (5 m/sec or 17.5 km/hour). That should be acceptable. Uncertainties include the residual thrust of the descent engine as it runs out of fuel, the softness of the lunar surface, and the additional energy absorption of the landing legs and engine nozzle if the descent rate exceeds the gear design limit, and how much safety factor there is in the honeycomb crush calculation. They all should be favoring a safe impact."
1024532|ALSJ||It's only a barnyard calculation, but I probably could not judge 40-foot eye height well with all the blowing dust. But I would certainly prefer that drop to trying to go through the abort sequence at that altitude.
1024532|ALSJ||More commentary on the translational velocities follows the landing.
1024540|ALSJ||At least one of the probes hanging from three of the footpads has touched the surface. Each of them is 67 inches (1.73 meters) long. The ladder strut doesn't have a probe. Buzz made the call at 20:17:40 GMT/UTC on 20 July 1969.
1024540|ALSJ|LMP|We asked that they take it off.
1024540|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that Apollo 11 photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-32396.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-32396</a>, taken on 4 April 1969, shows Eagle with a probe attached to the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> footpad. This indicates that the probe was removed after that date. The probe attachment is highlighted in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-32396det.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a>.
1024540|ALSJ||Apollo 11 photograph AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5921HR.jpg" target="alsj">5921</a> shows the area under the Descent Stage. A gouge mark made by the probe hanging down from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> (south) footpad is directly under the engine bell, a graphic demonstration that the spacecraft was drifitng left during the final seconds.
1024540|ALSJ|CDR|We continued to touchdown with a slight left translation. I couldn't precisely determine (the moment of) touchdown. Buzz called lunar contact, but I never saw the lunar contact lights.
1024540|ALSJ|LMP|I called contact light.
1024540|ALSJ|CDR|I'm sure you did, but I didn't hear it, nor did I see it.
1024544|ALSJ||Neil had planned to shut the engine down when the contact light came on, but didn't manage to do it.
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|I heard Buzz say something about contact, and I was spring-loaded to the stop engine position, but I really don't know...whether the engine-off signal was before (footpad) contact. In any event, the engine shutdown was not very high above the surface.
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|We actually had the engine running until touchdown. Not that that was intended, necessarily. It was a very gentle touchdown. It was hard to tell when we were on.
1024544|ALSJ|LMP|You wouldn't describe it as 'rock' (as in, 'dropping like a rock'). It was a sensation of settling.
1024544|ALSJ||Some of the other crews shut down 'in the air' (meaning 'prior to touchdown') and had a noticeable bump when they hit.
1024544|ALSJ|LMP|Well, they didn't want to jump so far to the ladder.
1024544|ALSJ||Readers should note that, although the Moon has no atmosphere, many of the astronauts used expression like 'in the air' to mean 'off the ground' and, after some thought, I have decided to follow their usage.
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|The touchdown itself was relatively smooth; there was no tendency toward tipping over that I could feel. It just settled down like a helicopter on the ground, and landed.
1024544|ALSJ||On a final note about engine shutdown, Ken Glover calls attention to the following from an interview done with Neil on 19 September 2001 by historians Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley at NASA Johnson.
1024544|ALSJ||<b>Brinkley</b>: "Was there anything about your Moon walk and collecting of rocks and the like that surprised you at that time when you were on the Moon, like, 'I did not expect to encounter this,' or, 'I did not expect it to look like this'? Or included in that, the view of the rest of space from the Moon must have been quite an awesome thing to experience."
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|I was surprised by a number of things, and I'm not sure (I can) recall them all now. I was surprised by the apparent closeness of the horizon. I was surprised by the trajectory of dust that you kicked up with your boot, and I was surprised that even though logic would have told me that there shouldn't be any, there was no dust when you kicked. You never had a cloud of dust there. That's a product of having an atmosphere, and when you don't have an atmosphere, you don't have any clouds of dust.
1024544|ALSJ||To clarify Neil's observation, on Earth, small particles don't travel very far due to air drag. Collectively, the particles kicked off the surface will stir the air it travels through, forming a dust cloud. Particles in the cloud will fall only slowly, and the cloud will last long enough to move with any breeze that is present. On the airless moon, each particle follows a ballistic trajectory. They don't form a cloud but, rather a sheet of individual particle all moving outward at about the same speed.
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|I was absolutely dumbfounded when I shut the rocket engine off and the particles that were going out radially from the bottom of the engine fell all the way out over the horizon, and when I shut the engine off, they just raced out over the horizon and instantaneously disappeared, you know, just like it had been shut off for a week. That was remarkable. I'd never seen that. I'd never seen anything like that. And logic says, yes, that's the way it ought to be there, but I hadn't thought about it and I was surprised.
1024544|ALSJ|CDR|ACA
1024544|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Because the Digital Autopilot (DAP) was in Attitude Hold, it was firing the jets like mad at touchdown to maintain the pre-touchdown attitude. By joggling the ACA, a new reference attitude was sent to the DAP. Since they weren't moving anymore, the new attitude needed no jet firing to maintain. Soon after, the DAP was cycled with the P68 landing confirmation program."
1024547|ALSJ||'413' is an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> address and has been a topic of considerable interest to Journal Contributors Marv Hein and Frank O'Brien. Frank supplied the following description.
1024547|ALSJ||O'Brien - "(The AGS is) a wonderful machine. If you have done any work on a computer that just has a switch register and display (such as an IMSAI, ALTAIR or one of my favorites, the KIM-1), you'd be comfortable with the AGS."
1024547|ALSJ||The way the AGS operated is that you had only an address and data display, 0-9 keypad, a Clear button, plus +/-, Enter and Readout. That's it. The ultimate in simple interfaces! How the AGS was operated was to press Clear, then a memory address. On a 5-octal character display, you got what was stored in that location. To change it, you typed a +/-, followed by 5 characters. Pressing Enter stored the value directly into memory. What you hear is the checklist item noted as: 413+10000. The key sequence is Clear, 413, Enter, +10000, Enter.
1024547|ALSJ||Address 413 contains the variable that indicates that the LM has landed - so any abort will be from the surface - which further tells the AGS to save the attitude information from its gyros. These gyros were 'strap-down' types, which means that they had a fixed orientation with respect to the LM body. They also had a nasty habit of drifting quite a bit. So, as soon as they landed, the AGS was to 'lock in', if you will, the attitude the LM was in. If the PGNS died - and it was the PGNS that oriented and re-aligned the AGS - at least they would have some approximate attitude information to abort with.
1024547|ALSJ||It is easy to understand how Charlie got momentarily tongue-tied when Neil reported the landing. There was not only the excitement and thrill of what they had all just achieved; but, also, after the intense concentration of the last few minutes, the sudden change in call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility".
1024547|ALSJ||After listening repeatedly to the tapes, Journal Contributor Ian Graham Clapp asks if it was really Buzz, not Neil, who thanked Charlie. To me, the cadence and inflection make it sound more like Buzz. In addition, I think it would have been more characteristic of Buzz to answer that quickly. Nonetheless, short transmissions like this one are often tough calls.
1024623|ALSJ||They will now prepare for immediate lift-off, in case, as an example, they have damaged an ascent fuel tank in the landing.
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah, there are things that should happen.
1024623|ALSJ|CDR|Crisp(ly).
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah, 'Crisp' is a good word. Because there are discrete abort times that you try to adhere to if you see something leaking, something going wrong.
1024623|ALSJ|CDR|Like, perhaps, if one footpad starts to sink into the surface and you're losing stability. Or you have a propellant tank pressure problem, or something that would cause us to go quickly.
1024623|ALSJ||Following our review of the landing, I asked Neil about the value of the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle and it similar predecessor, the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. These free-flying craft (shown here with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.lltv1.jpg" target="alsj">test pilot Joe Walker at the controls</a>) were built for NASA by Bell Aerosystems, Buffalo, NY and had a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.lltv2.jpg" target="alsj">General Electric CF-700-2V jet engine</a> mounted pointing downward so that, in effect, it removed 5/6th of the vehicle weight. According to Journal Contributor Ed Hengeveld, "lift for the remaining one-sixth of the LLTV's weight was provided by two 2250 Newton hydrogen peroxide lift rockets." Like the LM engine, these <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.lltv3.jpg" target="alsj">lift engines</a> could be gimbaled. The vehicle also had sets of thrusters. A landing in the LLTV was not an exact duplicate of a LM landing on the Moon, but the two vehicles did share many performance similarities. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LLRV.html" target="alsj">Two LLRVs and three LLTVs</a> were built and three crashed during test flights and training. All of the pilots - including Neil in the first of the three accidents - ejected safely. See, also, Gene Cernan's discussion of the LLTV at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../a17/a17.postland.html#1134349" target="alsj">113:43:49</a> in the Apollo 17 Journal.
1024623|ALSJ||As of August 2004, the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html" target="alsj">surviving LLTV</a> was on display in the lobby of Building 2 at NASA Johnson. John Osborn has provided an extensive set of photos.
1024623|ALSJ|CDR|I would say that the Lunar Module flew better than the LLTV - fortunately. However, it was a reasonable simulation of the Lunar Module, and it was the best we had. The full-mission (but stationary) <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">Lunar Module simulator</a> worked very well, but the real in-flight situation provided by the LLTVs provided a reality that was hard to duplicate in a fixed-base simulator."
1024623|ALSJ||Also used in training and in the development of the landing systems was the Lunar Landing Research Facility - shown here with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.llrf1.jpg" target="alsj">Neil standing in front of the LM mock-up</a>. The facility consisted of a large, overhead gantry which allowed the cable-suspended LM mock-up to be moved forward and down - or up and back - in response to pilot input. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.llrf2.jpg" target="alsj">figure</a> consists of a set of multiple exposures showing the mock-up as it comes in for a landing. Two frames captured by Ken Glover from film of a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training exercise</a> in late June 1969 show <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-llrf-behind.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">rear</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-llrf-side.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">side</a> views of the vehicle approaching touchdown. Note that the 'craters' were painted on the flat tarmac. Buzz 'flew' the LLRF on June 27 and 28; Neil on June 30.
1024623|ALSJ||In response to a 1997 question about his experience with the LLRF, Apollo 15 Commander Dave Scott offered the following: "Ah yes, the LLRF -- what an experience! The LLRF was indeed a large Erector-Set structure at Langley (Research Center) that operated much as you indicated. It was intended to provide LLTV-type training without the risk and cost - although it must have cost a bunch! However, it was actually used very little compared to the LLTV for several reasons. I tried it several times and found it to be negative training, albeit well-intended. The major problem for me was the lag in response to control inputs. Even though they had some feed-forward loops and, at the time, some sophisticated control modes, the system could just not compensate for a vehicle swinging from a cable. Thus, the very short systems lag in a very dynamic and tight loop was just enough to confuse the human response -- which for LLTV-type flight was probably on the order of 0.2-to-0.5 seconds from input to expected output. It was an impressive-looking rig though! Should be a reasonable amout of documentation on the LLRF in the Langley files; and some of the old-timers should have some good stories. It was very important to Langley (as were a number of other Apollo-support activities, such as docking simulators), and the structure may even still be there!"
1024623|ALSJ||Neil has provided some comments on the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.llrf.html" target="alsj">LLRF</a>. See, also, his comments about the LM engines during a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../navyastros.html" target="alsj">panel discussion</a> at the 1997 Naval Aviation Symposium.
1024623|ALSJ||We now move to discussion of the indoor, stationary simulator which was used as the primary training tool by the crews.
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|The (stationary) <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">LM simulator</a> was excellent in its fidelity of reproduction. As an example, we had the actual computer codes. Obviously, it was a simulation and the data the onboard computer used had to be generated somewhere; but, instead of that being generated in the simulator, it was done outside. It was a real test of the systems. Whoever made the decisions to do that made very wise ones. They're probably doing that more and more with simulators now. The level of detail in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">LM and Command Module simulators</a> for Apollo was unquestionably a pioneering effort that contributed significantly to how effective aircraft simulators and other situational simulators were later on."
1024623|ALSJ|CDR|It was extraordinary for its time and commercial aircraft simulators have undoubtedly benefited by duplicating the best parts.
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|Certainly the visual portrayal and, of course, the instrument activation.
1024623|ALSJ|CDR|What the LLTV gave you was not so much the seat-of-the-pants dynamics as the real-world visual. (Chuckling) That and the fact that, if you make a mistake, you can't hit the reset button.
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|I think it's important to stress the evolution of capabilities to accomplish the mission. The big difference I would point to between our mission and the later ones is that they had a much easier time landing. They could let the computer do a lot of stabilizing whereas we had to do a lot of that manually. Once we took over manually at 500 feet - which we had planned to do anyway - there was no way we could give it back to the computer. Whatever we had in the way of an attitude, it would hold. If it's accumulating a drift, it will get progressively worse unless you do something against it. On later systems, they closed the loop on it so that, if you let go of the controller, the computer would null translation. That made the descent on the later missions a lot easier to do - plus the fact that they weren't doing it for the first time.
1024623|ALSJ||Fjeld - "The later crews never used this Auto mode. They all had to struggle with the controls as Neil did, except that they had his experience to draw on: they made sure they could see the shadow and that they were fat on fuel."
1024623|ALSJ|LMP|I think it's important, historically, to keep some of these differences (between missions) in mind. Sometimes, when the TV networks are doing an anniversary program, they jazz up the tension. They always take about 5 seconds off the amount of fuel you have left, and they never put it in the perspective of how much fuel the other flights had. They're not interested in that and I think that ought to be included.
1024623|ALSJ||Readers should note, however, that Neil's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566_Sec12BiomedEvaluation.pdf" target="alsj">heart rate</a> at touch down was 150 beats per minute, the highest of any of the Commanders. The need to avoid West Crater was probably a contributing factor, although the drama of the moment was undoubtedly played a role as well. See the discussion at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1032537" target="alsj">103:25:37</a>. In response to a question in 2002, Neil remembers that his resting heart rate "was usually about 60".
1024638|ALSJ|LMP|We had a little right drift and, then, I guess just before touchdown, we drifted left.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|I think I was probably over controlling a little bit in lateral. I was confused somewhat in that I couldn't really determine what my lateral velocities were due to the dust obscuration of the surface. I could see rocks and craters through this blowing dust. It was my intention to try and pick up a landing spot prior to the 100-foot mark and then pick out an area just beyond it such that I could keep my eyes on that all the way down through the descent and final touchdown. I wouldn't, in fact, be looking at the place (where) I was going to land; I would be looking at a place just (out) in front of it. That worked pretty well, but I was surprised that I had as much trouble as I did in determining translational velocities. I don't think I did a very good job of flying the vehicle smoothly in that period of time. I felt I was a little bit erratic.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|
1024638|ALSJ||Neil came down through 100 feet at about 102:44:45 and landed at about 102:45:40. According to the Mission Report Landing on the surface occurred at 102:45:39.9 with negligible forward velocity, approximately 2.1 ft/sec to the crew's left, and 1.7 ft/sec vertically. Body rate transients (motions after first footpad touchdown) occurred and indicate that the right and forward landing gear touched almost simultaneously, giving a roll-left and a pitch-up motion to the vehicle. The left-directed lateral velocity resulted in a slight yaw right transient at the point of touchdown. These touchdown conditions, obtained from attitude rates and integration of acceleration data, were verified qualitatively, by the at-rest position of the lunar surface sensing probes and by surface build up around the rims of the footpads ( as photographed by the astronauts during the EVA)."
1024638|ALSJ||The fact that the right and forward footpads hit first indicates that Neil was still trying to correct his left translation and to impart a little forward motion.
1024638|ALSJ|LMP|I was feeding data to him all the time. I don't know what he was doing with it, but that was raw computer data.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|The computer data seemed to be pretty good information, and I would say that my visual perception of both altitude and altitude rate was not as good as I thought it was going to be. In other words, I was a little more dependent on the (computer) information. I think I probably could have made a satisfactory determination of altitude and altitude rate by eye alone, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be; and I think that it's not nearly so good as it is here on Earth.
1024638|ALSJ|LMP|I got the impression by just glimpsing out that we were at the altitude of seeing the shadow. Shortly after that, the horizon tended to be obscured by a tan haze. This may have been just an impression of looking down at a 45-degree angle. The depth of the material being kicked up seemed to be fairly shallow. In other words, it was scooting along the surface but, since particles were being picked up and moved along the surface, you could see little rocks of little protuberances coming up through this, so you knew that it was solid there. It wasn't obscured to that point, but it did tend to mask out your ability to detect motion because there was so much motion of things moving out. There were these few little islands that were stationary. If you could sort that out and fix on those, then you could tend to get the impression of being stationary. But that was quite difficult to do.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|It was a little bit like landing an airplane when there's a real thin layer of ground fog, and you can see things through the fog. However, all this fog was moving at a great rate, which was a little bit confusing.
1024638|ALSJ|LMP|I would think that it would be natural - looking out the left window and seeing this (dust) moving this way (left) - that you would get the impression of moving to the right, and you counteract by going to the left, which is how we touched down.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|Since we were moving left (toward the landing spot he had picked) , we were yawed slightly to the left so that I could get a good view of where we were going. I think we were <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Axes.jpg" title="line drawing" target="alsj">yawed</a> 13 degrees left; and, consequently, the shadow was not visible to me as it was behind the panel (Neil's window only gives a view from slightly right of forward around to 90 degrees left), but Buzz could see it. Then I saw it in the final phases of descent. I saw the shadow come into view, and it was a very good silhouette of the LM at the time I saw it. It was probably a couple of hundred feet out in front of the LM on the surface. (The shadow) is clearly a useful tool, but I just didn't get to observe it very long."
1024638|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-13.jpg" title="graph" target="alsj">Figure 5-13</a> from the Apollo 11 Mission Report shows LM attitude (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the six seconds before the landing and the four seconds after. At the begining of that interval, Neil had the LM yawed left 15 degrees, which increased to 16 degree during the final two seconds before the landing, and then decreased to 13 degress as the LM settled on the surface.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|I recall that there was some concern that surfaced in the last few days before launch. A systems concern about tank overpressurization due to the environment; (that is), to heating. So there were some procedural changes that were introduced - maybe not procedural changes but procedural concerns - and it was something that we discussed in those last few days before launch.
1024638|ALSJ||The page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur01.gif" target="alsj">Sur-1</a> of the Surface Checklist contains three handwritten lines concerning the fuel and oxidizer vents.
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|My recollection was that there was a new thought with regard to the heat sources that might be affecting those propellant tanks. And it was new procedures that were talked about, but I just don't remember those details.
1024638|ALSJ||Fjeld - "Engineering wanted to have the pressure in the tanks vented so that it didn't rise and cause the tank burst disks to rupture and perhaps spill propellant on the crew during EVA. Engineering also had the crew vent the very cold Supercritical Helium tank. As it turned out, the helium vented past the heat exchanger and fuel trapped there froze and blocked fuel down the line towards the still hot engine. Pressure built up in the fuel line for nearly an hour while the ground fretted about what would happen. Eventually, something let go. After the flight, the helium vent was re-designed."
1024638|ALSJ||Houston has decided, from a quick look at LM systems, that an immediate take-off will not be necessary. For the next several minutes, the crew will continue preparations to leave, if necessary, while Houston takes a more thorough look at the spacecraft systems. Along with other activities, the crew is now depressurizing the descent stage oxidizer tank.
1024638|ALSJ|LMP|Do you think the Surface (science) guys knew what the systems guys were going to do in terms of venting?
1024638|ALSJ|CDR|There's a difference. This was a safety issue in the minds of the people who were worrying about it. And it took priority over science.
1024746|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes, "Noun 43 displays the PGNS-calculated location of the landing site - in latitude, longitude and distance from the center of the moon."
1024746|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Harland notes that Charlie had warned Mike at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1021600" target="alsj">102:16:00</a> that he might lose high-gain lock-on during the LM's powered descent.
1024746|ALSJ||Apollo Flight Journal Editor David Woods writes, "There are two switches on panel 3 of the Command Module's main display console (MDC) that come under the heading 'UP TLM' or 'Up telemetry. The leftmost of the two switches selects whether the radio channel for the data uplink (from Earth to the spacecraft) will carry data (its normal mode) or whether it will act as a backup channel for voice from Houston. The rightmost is concerned with the up-data link (UDL) equipment. It's normal (center) position sends power to the UDL equipment. The down position is 'off', so no power is sent to the UDL equipment. The up position is labelled 'CMD RESET' meaning 'Command Reset' and its stated function, according to the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aohindex.html" target="alsj">Apollo Operations Handbook</a> (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AOH_3-143.pdf" target="alsj">page 3-143</a>) is "resets all of real time command relays except bank 'A.' " The switch is spring loaded to return to the center position after being pushed up. I don't know why resetting these relays causes Columbia's high gain antenna to reacquire Earth."
1024746|ALSJ||In Charlie's transmission at 102:49:39, the figure 10254 - with the '5' emphazied, indicating that something else was loaded in its place - is a Ground Elapsed Time of 102:54.
1024746|ALSJ||During the 1969 Technical Debrief, Buzz indicated that he loaded the wrong data from the on-board, pre-printed data card.
1024746|ALSJ|LMP|On the data card, we've got the PDI Pad, which is referred to somewhat during the descent. It (the data card) has PDI aborts on it, with a No-PDI plus 12 (minutes) abort on the right side. I think that the No-PDI plus 12 abort would be better placed on the back of this altitude card because, once you ignite, you're through with that No-PDI plus 12 abort and you ought to get it out of there. In its place, I think the T-2 abort Pad should be on the data card because, when I started to load P12 with Noun 33 - the Tig for this T-2 abort, which is PDI plus 23 (minutes) - I loaded the Tig for the No-PDI plus 12 abort, and the ground caught me on it and said, 'You loaded R(egister)-2 wrong.' Now, the two are pretty close (that is, the times don't differ by much) and they both say Tig Noun 33. So, I think if we can get that one abort - No-PDI plus 12 - out of there and put the other one in its place, it'll save someone from coming up with the same sort of thing.
1024746|ALSJ||Pads - or PADs - come up frequently during the missions and the following discussion has been provided by Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien - "The Pads are officially referred to as simply 'voice updates'. The name also refers to the actual form the data was written onto. Now, here's one of the best-kept secrets of the Apollo Program: Pads were nothing more than 'cheat-sheets' the crew could use during major mission activities. In preparation for major mission activities - such as platform alignments, descent, rendezvous, etc. - much of the information that wasn't obvious to the crew nor easily calculated by the computer was relayed verbally from the ground. The crew simply copied the data down onto forms (Pads) preformatted with the computer commands needed for data entry. Pads were the ultimate in 'fill in the blanks'! When and if the crew needed the data and procedures - particularly if comm with Houston were lost - it was trivial to refer to the appropriate Pad. Pads are the essence of good human engineering!"
1024746|ALSJ|CDR|I suppose that 5515.2 is the known surface velocity of the Moon. Right?
1024746|ALSJ|LMP|In some coordinates.
1024746|ALSJ||Buzz is on checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur11.gif" target="alsj">Sur-11</a>. Journal Conributors Paul Fjeld and Harald Kuckarek point out that 5515.2 is the P-12 entry for the desired, post-liftoff, horizontal velocity at the Injection altitude of 30 nautical miles.
1024746|ALSJ|CDR|Clearly, we were trying to initialize AGS so that, if we would have to use it, we would have taken some of the drift out of it.

1025549|ALSJ||On a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-lse248det.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from a 300 dpi scan of a Xerox copy of 1:5000 LM Lunar Surface Map LSE 2-48, I have marked what is probably a boulder just east of West Crater. The grid squares on this 1:5000 map are 50 meters on a side and the north-south size of the boulder is about 1-2 meters and close to the resolution limit.
1025549|ALSJ||During training, later crews had views in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">simulator</a> windows of their specific landing site. The Landing and Ascent facility - or the L&amp;A, as it was called - consisted of a model of the landing site and a TV camera which flew to it in response to the crew's actions in the simulator. The accompanying <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/TRAIN01.JPG" target="alsj"> photo</a> was supplied by Frank O'Brien and shows the L&amp;A facility on the left and the LM Mission Simulator on the right.
1025549|ALSJ||I asked Neil and Buzz if they had an L&amp;A representation of the Tranquility site.
1025549|ALSJ|LMP|We didn't have any identified terrain. It was so nondescript.
1025549|ALSJ|CDR|We did not have a specific lunar surface model for our destination. We had the surface photographs from (Apollo) 10 that went through our entire approach and landing path, but those were taken from high altitude.
1025549|ALSJ|LMP|Wasn't the Cat's Paw about the only identifiable thing that was on the photos and, then the (landing) ellipse was relative to that? Was that off ahead of us? What I'm kind of saying is that the specific, recognizable things were kind of early in the descent, and then when we got down to like pitchover and throttle down and, you know, 5 or 6,000 feet - and from there on down there weren't any things that we were looking for other than flatness.
1025549|ALSJ||Phil Stooke of the Department of Geography, University of Western Ontario, has provided a post-flight <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/apollo11site2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">map</a> showing the landing ellipse and surrounding area with some feature names, including the Cat's Paw. Stooke says that the map is an "untitled MSC graphic, post-landing, photocopied at the LPI library in Houston. Cat's Paw was named informally before the landing; but, as luck would have it, I can't find a document to prove it as I write this!"
1025549|ALSJ|CDR|I had certain expectations - 'hopes', maybe - of seeing certain crater patterns that I could recognize with respect to what our intended landing point was. But, after the pitchover, as we were, maybe, a couple of miles further downrange than we intended to be at that point, I could not pick them out.
1025549|ALSJ||I then asked about the type of visuals they had in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">simulators</a> at the Cape and at Houston.
1025549|ALSJ|CDR|We had a generic lunar surface. A hypothetical surface.
1025549|ALSJ|LMP|General purpose. It was not specific to a...Well, it was for our mission, because the other guys didn't use it. It was an inverted thing mounted on the ceiling and the camera flew to it.
1025549|ALSJ||The point on the horizon directly opposite the Sun is called the down-Sun or zero-phase direction. It is early morning at Tranquility and the Sun is low in the eastern sky. At zero-phase there is a very strong reflection of sunlight which tends to washout the scene. The process chiefly responsible for the brightness of zero-phase is called <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/coherentbcksctr.html" target="alsj">Coherent Backscatter</a>. In addition, rocks and craters tend to hide their own shadows, thereby making detail even harder to see.
1025549|ALSJ|CDR|Whenever we had time available and didn't have to press with the checklist, why we had a natural interest to look outside and report what we saw.
1025701|ALSJ||In his extraordinary book, </i>Carrying the Fire, <i>Mike recalls that, because he was hearing Neil and Buzz on a relay from Houston, it was two and a half seconds before he heard Neil say "Well there are two of them (smiling faces) up here." Mike wrote that, as soon as he heard Neil, "I say 'And don't forget one in the Command Module'; but, in the meantime Houston has heard Neil and has answered him, 'Roger. That was a beautiful job, you guys.' I was more than a little embarrassed to hear their message coming in as I was mouthing mine. It sounded like I was asking them not to forget complimenting me for doing a beautiful job in the command module, instead of merely adding my smiling face to the list." Such are the hazards of communications with built-in time delays.
1025750|ALSJ||Because of the uneven terrain, the LM is tilted slightly backward. However, this is the smallest pitch/roll deviation of any of the landed LMs. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrtbl9-6IV.jpg" title="data table" target="alsj">Table 9.6.IV</a> in the Apollo 11 Mission Report gives the orientation of the LM on the surface as indicated by the PGNS and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a>: pitch, +4.4 degrees (tilted back); roll, +0.5 degrees (Buzz's side of the spacecraft slightly higher than Neil's; and yaw, +13.3 degrees (a counterclockwise rotation around the vertical axis, hiding the LM shadow from Neil's view).
1025750|ALSJ||Mike is in an orbit 60 nautical miles (110 km) above the surface, with a period of about 1 hour 58 minutes. In that orbit, he could maintain line-of-sight communications with the LM until he was below the Tranquility Base horizon, which would happen about 20/360ths of an orbit after passing over the landing site, or about 6.5 minutes. He passed over the landing site about about 102:41 which, because Eagle was decelerating throughout powered descent, was about five minutes before Eagle landed. He lost direct comm with the LM one or two mintues later and, thereafter, had heard no comm until Houston got the relay established. He has missed roughly eleven minutes of LM comm.
1025750|ALSJ||Mike will go behind the Moon in about a half hour and re-emerge about forty-five minutes later.
1030044|ALSJ||Copasetic is a word meaning "very satisfactory" which originate in about 1919 and was a part of popular, coffee-house culture during the early and mid-1950s when Charlie was in high school and the US Naval Academy.
1030044|ALSJ||During our 1991 mission review in Santa Fe, Buzz wanted to talk about the decision to do a simulated countdown at this point in the mission.
1030044|ALSJ|CDR|
1030044|ALSJ|CDR|Just to add a bit to that, these procedures - the pre-lift-off procedures, launch prep, you might call it - had never been done before. And, since we had this (abort opportunity) coming up one (Command Module) orbit after the landing, and (since) we were going to have to do it the next day when we actually left, Buzz suggested - and I thought it was an excellent suggestion - that we use that opportunity to go through the procedures one time in the real world to (1) be ready if we needed it and (2) practice it and find out that those procedures really worked and everything seemed to be (okay). (For the later missions) they took it for granted that the procedures worked and, apparently, didn't need to convince themselves."
1030044|ALSJ|LMP|But the reason (for doing the simulated countdown) was not, necessarily, to see whether they worked or not, but to just have the comfort of having just recently gone through the lift-off procedures. Okay, so now you set that aside and you do all your surface stuff however long you're on there, and you know in your mind that, if anything comes up, 'Oh, I've just gone through the lift-off procedure; I'm familiar with those' So, if for some reason you've got to lift-off in a hurry or something like that, you know what it is you've got to do instead of scurrying down the checklist. Anyway, I'm just observing that I felt that those were good things and they were ignored and I didn't understand why.
1030332|ALSJ||They have probably removed the waist-to-floor <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/restraints.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">tethers</a> that they wore during the landing to keep them firmly in place.
1030332|ALSJ|LMP|I can't remember hooking the tethers up before lift-off (from the Moon).
1030332|ALSJ|CDR|I remember hooking them up, but I can't recall when that was.
1030332|ALSJ||The relevant item is "Attach Restraints", which is the second line of Surface Checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur58.gif" target="alsj">Sur-58</a>.
1030332|ALSJ|LMP|You remember hooking yours up; I don't remember hooking mine up. But, I didn't notice that I was floating around when we got into orbit, either.
1030332|ALSJ||During the landing, they also wore their gloves and helmets and, at this point in the mission review, I asked if the suits had been pressurized at all during the landing. Certainly, they wouldn't have wanted enough pressure in the suits to restrict hand motions.
1030332|ALSJ|LMP|It was probably just enough to give you flow (of oxygen through the suit). It wasn't a hard suit that would have constrained your actions. If anything (a little pressure) would have been easier because it would lift the suit.
1030355|ALSJ||The 'hill' can be seen just to the left of the LM shadow in AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5451HR.jpg" target="alsj">5451</a>, which Neil took out his window prior to the EVA, and in AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5454HR.jpg" target="alsj">5454</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5455HR.jpg" target="alsj">5455</a>, which Buzz took out his window.

The hills are raised portions of the rim of a 200m crater and are about 200m from the LM.
1030355|ALSJ||With the Sun very low in the sky, even shallow, rimless craters are filled with shadow while those with rims cast long shadows on the surrounding terrain.

1030557|ALSJ||For the LM, P22 is the program which uses the rendezvous radar (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/rendradar.jpg" target="alsj">LM-9</a> photo by Randy Attwood) to track the Command Module as it passes overhead.
1030557|ALSJ|LMP|His P22 was different than our P22. What he was trying to do was look in the sextant and try to see us.
1030557|ALSJ|CDR|I assume that what they're sending him are pointing angles for the sextant. (True)
1030557|ALSJ||The statement "4 miles south" indicates that Houston thinks the landing site is four miles south of Mike's ground track. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14.jpg" target="alsj">Figure 5-14</a> in the Apollo 11 Mission Report shows the sextant targets that Mike tried on various passes over the landing site.

1030557|ALSJ||David Woods tells us that Verb 16 - monitor in decimal form - and Noun 65 - time from the computer - would give Buzz the current Ground Elapsed Time. Buzz is doing the gravity alignment P57, on checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur02.gif" target="alsj">Sur-2</a>, which includes a step (Verb) 06 (Noun) 22, which displays the gimbal angles. Evidently, Buzz wanted to ask P57 to recycle to the beginning (Verb 32) so he could get the time with 16 65, but it proceeded with 06 22.

1030908|ALSJ|CDR|We needed to establish an initial attitude for the (inertial) platform. And the technique is to use a local vertical for one axis and use gravity to do that alignment. And the second is to use a star to align the platform in yaw, essentially.
1030908|ALSJ||Jones - "In other words, what you need to know is the absolute orientation of the platform so that, when you're ready to leave, the spacecraft will know which way to go."
1030908|ALSJ|CDR|Precisely.
1031015|ALSJ|CDR|This type of alignment had never previously been done, and it was our interest, I think - since that would have to be done before launch - to get a chance to check that procedure out if we needed it for the first revolution (that is, needed to return to orbit when Mike came around again) or, if not, to have at least have gone through it before we had to do it the next day.
1031015|ALSJ|LMP|If you're going to have problems, it's best to have them happen now when you've got a lot of time.

1031015|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien writes, "Also, the reason why cycling the breaker worked was most likely because a weak solder joint expanded from the heat, opening the circuit. Pulling the breaker allowed the equiment to cool off, reseal the cracked joint and continue operation."
1031244|ALSJ||Neil's choice of inflection in this statement led me to ask if they had expected to see basalts.
1031244|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't expect any limestone.
1031244|ALSJ|LMP|Whatever I saw, I wasn't going to be too disappointed. I don't think I do now, nor do I think I did then, very much, have that much of an expectation or guess as to just what it might be. Whatever it is is okay with me.
1031244|ALSJ|CDR|I think both of us were trying to just describe what we saw whenever we had a little free time. Anything that might be helpful to the science teams on the ground. They'd been waiting a long time for this information.
1031244|ALSJ||Regretably, I didn't ask Neil what he meant by "country" basalt. Journal Contributor Larry Turoski calls attention to the following from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_rock_(geology): "<b>Country rock</b> is a geological term meaning the rock native to an area. It is similar and in many cases interchangeable with the terms basement and wall rocks. The term is used to denote the usual strata of a region in relation to the rock which is being discussed or observed." The important point is that Neil says it looks like basalt.
1031244|ALSJ||I noted that they'd had <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap-geotrips.html" target="alsj">geology field trips</a> at various times over the years and asked if that had intensified in the months leading up to Apollo 11.
1031244|ALSJ|CDR|I'm not sure that we did any after we were assigned to the flight. We may have done one; but I don't remember. I think that most of that work was done earlier when we were not tied up with flight assignments.
1031244|ALSJ||In fact, Neil and Buzz had only one field trip after being assigned to Apollo 11. That trip was a one-day exercise on February 24, 1969 to Sierra Blanca, Texas along with the backup LM crew, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise. The relative lack of geology work is unsurprising given the fact that the overwhelming focus of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a> and the mission was a safe and successful first landing.

Apollo 16 geology team leader Bill Muehlberger writes, "They went into the large arroyos to learn how to sample when a variety of rocks are spread out. I wasn't part of (the Sierra Blanca field trip), but I have heard about it from Gordon Swann, Dale Jackson, and Uel Clanton."

David Woods writes, "Noun 93 is the delta gyro angles which give the differences between the prealignment and post-alignment orientation of the platform. It is essentially a measure of how much the platform had to move to achieve proper alignment." The Greek letter delta ( &Delta; / &delta;), the ancestor of the modern Latin letter ' D / d', is often used in mathematics to indicate a difference, in this case, a difference in gyro angles.

1031526|ALSJ|LMP|You've got the previous alignment in the AGS and you've just re-aligned the PGNS and, if that (new PGNS alignment) isn't very good, you don't want to screw up the one in the AGS. If it is (good), you store it in the AGS.

1032254|ALSJ||Gene Cernan says that, while standing in the shadow of the Apollo 17 LM, he could see some stars while he was outside. I asked the 11 crew if they had made any such experiment.
1032254|ALSJ|CDR|I don't recall doing it on the surface. We tried a good bit inside.
1032254|ALSJ|LMP|I guess I wouldn't have given it any hope at all.
1032254|ALSJ|CDR|There was a thought that, if you could look through a tube, you would probably be able to see stars. I don't remember that we tried anything like that.
1032254|ALSJ|LMP|You could see them in the AOT, which was sort of like that.
1032254|ALSJ|CDR|Which was just one power (meaning a telescope with no magnification).
1032254|ALSJ||A related question is whether or not stellar images could have been captured in any of the lunar surface photography. A discussion from Sky and Telescope Editor Dennis di Ciccio is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-stars.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1032254|ALSJ|LMP|The ideal was to get a gravity direction and then to do a two-star alignment and look at the torquing angles after the two-star check which would then give an indication as to what the drift had been since the last alignment. The initial gravity alignment, combined with the two-star alignment, would produce a new location of the landing site. (See below.) Had we landed straight ahead (instead of being yawed left 13 degrees), my intent was to use Rigel in the left (rear) detent number 6 and Capella in the right (rear) <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html" target="alsj">detent</a>. The 13-degree yaw moved Capella out of the right-rear detent, but Rigel was in good shape there. That's the one I used first. I then selected Navi in number 4 detent, the right rear, and that wasn't particularly satisfactory. It was quite dim and it took a good bit longer than I had hoped to get the marks on that."
1032254|ALSJ||Contrary to Buzz's statement here, the alignment procedures gave no information about landing site location. Frank O'Brien adds, "The gravity alignment and stellar alignments performed the same function, namely, to align the IMU to a known attitude. In both cases, the attitude was determined with respect to two vectors: either two stars (a stellar alignment) or one star and the local vertical as indicated by gravity (a gravity alignment). Neither procedure was used to determine position, which was the purpose of the state vector."
1032537|ALSJ|CDR|That's not surprising.
1032537|ALSJ||Pete Conrad's heart rate was not recorded during the Apollo 12 descent. Of the remaining Commanders, John Young set the record low of 89 at the moment of Apollo 16 touchdown, while the other three were all in the mid to upper 90s.
1032537|ALSJ||T3 is the next pre-programmed launch opportunity, in this case a chance to catch Mike when he passes overhead on his second post-landing pass.
1032537|ALSJ||They have an event timer on the control panel - essentially a stopwatch - and they want to set it so that it reaches 60:00 at T3. The reason for doing this is so that, if they have lost comm with Houston and need to launch, they will know when to do so for a relatively easy rendezvous with Mike.

1033957|ALSJ||The reason for pulling the circuit breaker is to let the cracked solder joint cool down enough that it will stay closed the launch and ascent - which it does.

1033957|ALSJ||O'Brien - "A program alarm 1106 is an error during an E-memory dump."
1033957|ALSJ||That is, Ground Elapsed Time 103:53:00 since launch. He actually means 103:54.
1033957|ALSJ||Before doing the photography, they are completing the tasks on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur07.gif" target="alsj">Sur-7</a>. Specifically, they are copying down data they would need for a launch at T-3. Buzz will write the data on some pre-printed forms.
1033957|ALSJ||Next, Buzz will do a readback to be certain that he has copied the numbers correctly.
1033957|ALSJ||By putting the computer in Program 00 and Data, they will be able to accept memory updates radioed up from Houston. In moving the rendezvous radar "up to plus X", Buzz will be pointing it at the zenith.
1035947|ALSJ||I noted that Houston has just read up a long Pad of data and is now sending more data electronically and asked why.
1035947|ALSJ|LMP|We copied the data down that was useful to us in the normal sense for the activities that were going to be happening. CSI (for example), was a maneuver after we lifted off. What we copied wasn't the same data as what was going in the computer.
1035947|ALSJ|CDR|We copied maneuver data - time of ignition and things (like that) - and we always wanted to have that information current so that if we lost comm we would have a basis for knowing what we were doing and wouldn't have to rely on just the computer being absolutely right. We wanted a sense of what was supposed to be happening. The numbers (that Charlie read up) are times and what look like three axes of position and velocity.
1035947|ALSJ||I asked if they had extensive training for the contingency of a major computer loss.
1035947|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to be able to get off (the Moon) on either PGNS or <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> without comm, if we had to."
1035947|ALSJ|CMP|
1035947|ALSJ|CDR|We did have an open-loop program for going up into orbit without (either) PGNS or AGS, but we didn't have a lot of confidence in our ability to get into a safe orbit with that. There would have been no reason not to try it if that's all you had."
1035947|ALSJ||Generally, NASA's Apollo philosophy was to not try to cover double-mode failures - situations in which there have been simultaneous failures of two systems such as the loss of both computers, or the loss of comm and one or both of the computers.

From the bottom of the footpads to the top of the rendezvous radar, the LM is 7.04 meters tall and, on level ground with the solar elevation 11.37 degrees, the LM shadow would be 35 meters long.

1040226|ALSJ||During the 1969 Technical Debrief, Neil and Buzz made the following comments about the view out the window.
1040226|ALSJ|CDR|The things that seem worthy of comment here are observations from the window prior to lunar surface work. We were in a relatively smooth area covered with craters varying (in diameter) from up to perhaps 100 feet in the near vicinity down to less than a foot, with density inversely proportional to the size of the crater. The smaller they were, the more there were of them (in a given area). The ground mass was very fine silt, and there were a lot of rocks of all sizes, angularities, and types in the area. Our immediate area was relatively free of large rocks (which is why Neil landed in it). Several hundred feet to our right (north), there was a significant boulder field - an array of boulders, essentially, that had many boulders greater than 1 or 2 feet in size. We were never able to get into that area to look at those rocks in detail.
1040226|ALSJ|LMP|Distances are deceiving. When we looked at this fairly large boulder field off to the right, it didn't look very far away at all, before we went out(side). Of course, once we got out, we wandered as far out as seemed appropriate; (and), of course, we never came close to this particular field. What really impressed me was the difference in distances. After we were back in(side) again, looking out at the flag, the television, and the experiments, they looked as though they were right outside the window. In fact, on the surface, we had moved them a reasonable distance away. So I think distance judgment is not too good on first setting down. The tendency is to think that things are a good bit closer than they actually are. This says they (meaning the boulders) are probably a good bit larger than what we might have initially estimated.
1040226|ALSJ||Interested readers might want to compare AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5952HR.jpg" target="alsj">5952</a>, which shows the Lunar Ranging Retro-Reflector (LRRR or LR-cubed) from near the deployment site with the LM in the background, with AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5551HR.jpg" target="alsj">5551</a>, which is a post-EVA shot out Neil's window showing the LRRR out past the LM thrusters.
1040226|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt, the Apollo 17 LMP, seemed to have less trouble estimating distances than did the others. During our Apollo 17 mission review, he suggested that, in addition to the problem of not having familiar objects in the scene to help with distance estimates, the absolute lack of obscuration by haze is an important factor. On Earth, haze makes distant objects less distinct than nearby objects and helps us judge relative distance. On the Moon, there is no atmosphere and no haze, so everything looks distinct and close. Readers who have spent time both in dry climates - such as the mountain west of the United States - and in wet climates - such as Florida - will have experienced a similar effect. The dry air of the West is clearer and, there, distant objects look much closer than they would in the wet air of the East. During the second Apollo 17 EVA, Gene Cernan also commented that the lack of color variation along a line of sight also contributed to the difficulty of estimating distances.
1040226|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ken Glover adds: "These discussions about judging distances on the moon always remind me of a trip I took several years ago to Baffin Island, in the Arctic. We hiked up a mountain there, and our local 'guide' was showing me how to distinguish distances using colour, that is; the blues and greys (I don't now recall which was near or far) in the absence of ANY other means of judging distance. I still found it difficult to do, but I guess one would get used to it in time. It was cool."
1040226|ALSJ|CDR|Probably the most surprising thing to me, even though I guess we suspected a certain amount of this, was the light and color observations of the surface. The down-Sun area was extremely bright. It appeared to be a light tan in color, and you could see into the washout region reasonably well. Detail was obscured somewhat by the washout, but not badly. As you proceeded back toward cross-Sun, brightness diminished, and the (tan) color started to fade, and it began to be more gray. As we looked back as far as we could from the LM windows, the color of the surface was actually a darker gray. I'd say not completely without color, but most of the tan had disappeared as we got back into that area, and we were looking at relatively dark gray. In the (LM) shadow, it was very dark. We could see into the shadows, but it was difficult.
1040226|ALSJ|LMP|We could see very small gradations in color (and brightness) that were the result of very small topographical changes.
1040226|ALSJ|CDR|Of course, when we actually looked at the material, particularly the silt, up close, it did, in fact, turn out to be sort of charcoal gray or the color of a graded lead pencil. When you're actually faced with trying to interpret this kind of color and that light reflectivity, it is amazing.
1040226|ALSJ|LMP|When illuminated, it did have a gray appearance, very light gray.
1040226|ALSJ||Buzz is asking if anyone connected to the audio circuit has a microphone switched on (keyed). Normally, the CapCom is the only person who transmits to the astronauts, but there are others who have the ability to do so if appropriate. Among these are the Flight Director and, designated individuals at the three tracking stations. See, for example, John Saxon's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2wake.html#1394004" target="alsj">account</a> of his conversation with the Apollo 16 crew when a communications link between Houston and the Honeysuckle Creek receiving station went down shortly after EVA-2 wake-up. Normally, anyone with the ability to talk to the crew would 'key' that circuit before talking to them and then switch off when the exchange was finished.
1040226|ALSJ||On a historical note, beginning in the 1920s, the word 'microphone' was often shortened to 'mike'. Beginning in the 1960s, 'mic' came into fashion. Because the Apollo checklists use 'mike', the Journal uses that version.

1041513|ALSJ||O'Brien - "One of the many tasks of the Digital AutoPilot is to calculate the firing times of the RCS thrusters for a given rotational rate.

1041513|ALSJ||Neil thought that, perhaps, they used the actual longitude divided by two to get more significant digits.
1041513|ALSJ|CDR|But why? I don't know.
1041513|ALSJ||O'Brien - "The choice of 'longitude-over-two' was a way to realize three decimal digits of precision. As the computer display was limited to only five digits, it could not display the full range of longitude (plus or minus 180 degrees) plus the necessary three decimal digits. By dividing the longitude by two, a precision of +/- 0.002 degrees could be obtained." Because the full range of latitude is only plus or minus 90 degrees, it was not necessary to use the artifice of 'latitude-over-two'.
1041513|ALSJ||The latitude and longitude of the landing site given in the Mission Report are 0.688 degrees north and 23.433 degrees east, respectively. A discussion of landing site coordinates is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsjcoords.html" target="alsj">here</a>.

Continuing through the checklist, looking at switch settings and circuit breaker cards, we found ourselves with 10 minutes to do and essentially up (that is, at the right place) on the checklist. At that point, we had to start pressurizing the APS (Ascent Propulsion System) if we were going to launch, so we read through the remainder of the simulated countdown and decided that there wasn't any point in sticking with that timeline any further. So we terminated the simulated countdown and went to the initial powerdown sequence.

1043948|ALSJ|LMP|We had discussed, among ourselves, the possibility of evaluating, during this first 2 hours, whether we wanted to go on with the rest period (scheduled to begin at 104:50) or to proceed with the EVA preparation. I think we had concluded before the end of the simulated countdown that we would like to go ahead with the EVA and it was sometime in here that Neil called to ground and let them know that.
1043948|ALSJ|CDR|There were two factors that we thought might influence that decision. One was the spacecraft systems and any abnormalities that we might have that we'd want to work on; and the second was our adaptation to one-sixth g and whether we thought more time in one-sixth g before starting the EVA would be advantageous or disadvantageous at that point. Basically, my personal feeling was that the adaptation to one-sixth g was very rapid and was very pleasant, easy to work in, and I thought at the time that we were ready to go right ahead into the surface work and recommended that.
1043948|ALSJ||I asked about the reason for flying the B&amp;W TV camera versus the color camera that was flown on 10 and later on 12 and 14.
1043948|ALSJ|CDR|It was a much smaller camera.
1043948|ALSJ|LMP|They had much more flexibility to put that on 10 without disturbing things.
1043948|ALSJ|CDR|We had a color camera, too, in the Command Module. I don't know the answer to the question specifically, but this image orthicon (camera) was the one we had trained with and used in many of our ground simulations. We were concerned because we'd never seen a good picture on the ground. But the technicians assured us that, in the actual flight situation, we'd get a picture. And that accounts for my little question there, where I say, 'But, we'll see.'
1043948|ALSJ|LMP|Now, we estimated EVA at 8 o'clock. I think that was a little optimistic. The ground recognized that, because they said, 'Do you mean beginning of Prep or beginning of hatch opening?'
1043948|ALSJ||EVA preps nominally take about 2 hours. In reality, it will be an hour and a half until they get started and then another three hours until they get the hatch open. Because the EVA will be a short one and there is plenty of padding built into the timeline, the delay will only be important to the global audience waiting for the historic moment.
1043948|ALSJ|CDR|It was always our plan (to prepare for the EVA at this point in the mission), unless circumstances prevented it. However, it wasn't published.
1043948|ALSJ|LMP|We wanted any change to be a positive change. So we sort of set the sequence up on the surface to allow for an orbit or two delay here or an orbit or two delay there and our being tired on the surface - which we didn't expect to be at all! So, if it was that way, we'd advance it. But, if we were pushed, then nobody would know. We'd just stay on the flight plan.
1043948|ALSJ|CDR|Just protecting against illogical criticism by the press if you delay anything. We didn't want it to appear as a failure of our planning.

1044248|ALSJ||At <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1042042" target="alsj">104:20:42</a>, Charlie gave Mike estimated latitude and longitude for the LM corresponding to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/LAM2_CMP-flown.jpg" target="alsj">map</a> coordinates M.5/8.0. Near that location, Mike drew a small circle in pencil with an arrow pointing to it. There is a very small crater at the center of the circle and this may be the 'tiny crater' Mike refers to here. Alternatively, the circle may be associated with the first and last of three sextant locations Mike seems to have tried during the pass over the landing site at approximately 108:35: M.8/8.2, P.2/6.3, and M.7/8.0. As indicated in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14.jpg" target="alsj">Figure 5-14</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mr.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a>, the sextant field-of view corresponds to a circle on the ground 3.2 km in diameter, so the differences between M.5/8.0, M.8/8.2, and M.7/8.0 are inconsequential. I am inclined to think that Mike circled the 'tiny crater' during the pass just completed.
1044248|ALSJ|LMP|All during this time, we could tell that Mike was kept busy each pass, doing P22s trying to find where we were.
1050030|ALSJ|CDR|This is Mike at his best. We had a four-gimbal platform on <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html" target="alsj">Gemini</a>."
1050030|ALSJ|CDR|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_imu.gif target="alsj">three gimbals</a>. The outer gimbal (OG) is mounted on an axis attached to the spacecraft and the assembly is free to rotate around the outer-gimbal axis (OGA). The middle gimbal (MG) is attached to the inside of the outer gimbal at points 90-degrees from the OGA. Similarly, the inner gimbal carries the platform and is fixed at points perpendicular to the middle gimbal axis (MGA).
1050030|ALSJ||As the spacecraft maneuvers, the gimbals swing in such a way as to keep the platform in the same absolute orientation. For the purposes of this discussion, let us assume that the platform and gimbal system always start in the configuration shown in the diagram. Now, let us imagine that the spacecraft does a rotation around the OGA. Clearly, the gimbal system will have no trouble keeping the platform properly aligned and, indeed, the three axes will remain mutually perpendicular no matter how large or small a rotation is done.
1050030|ALSJ||Next, let us go back to the original configuration and consider what happens if the pilot rotates the spacecraft around the IGA. Again, for any arbitrary rotation, the three axes remain mutually perpendicular, with the platform in its original orientation.
1050030|ALSJ||Finally, let us return to the original configuration and consider what would happen if the pilot did a rotation around the middle gimbal axis (MGA) in such a way that the upper part of OGA goes back away from us and the lower part comes up towards us. Here, the three axes do not remain mutually perpendicular and, if our pilot were to stop the rotation after 90 degrees, we would find ourselves with a gimbal lock, with the IGA and OGA aligned. In essence, we now have a two-axis system instead of a three axis system; and if, from this configuration, our pilot were to do rotation around an imaginary axis perpendicular to the horizontal plane that contains all three gimbal axes, then the platform orientation would change and indeed, would rotate in lockstep with the spacecraft. Hence the term, "gimbal lock".
1050030|ALSJ||David Woods adds: "It is important to realise that the Apollo spacecraft (both CM and LM) could go into gimbal lock at any time during a mission. Therefore, during mission planning, it was necessary to understand what attitudes needed to be adopted by the spacecraft at every stage of the flight. Then they could ensure that the alignment of the guidance platform with respect to the stars would always be set so that gimbal lock would not be entered. The numbers that defined the alignment of the platform were referred to as a REFSMMAT - basically a set of angles with respect to the stars. Apollo 8 used three different REFSMMATs and the later J-missions used upwards of eight REFSMMATs. It was to accommodate all the various attitudes that a mission would require to achieve its goal."

1050030|ALSJ||The Environmental Control System (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a>) contains two lithium hydroxide canisters to remove carbon dioxide from the cabin air.

The secondary canister, identical to the canisters used in the PLSSs, has a capacity of about 18 person hours. The flight plan calls for replacement of the primary canister after the post-landing rest period at about 109:30 or about 20 person-hours of use. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM11-co3lbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">replacement canister</a> - stowed behind the ascent engine cover since before launch from Earth - would then be used until rendezvous and docking at about 128 hours. Subtracting off about six person hours for the EVA, the replacement canister was planned for about 31 person hours of use. Clearly, there is plenty of margin in both canisters and, in addition, they have a backup capacity of about 20 person hours from the secondary canister.

1052608|ALSJ|LMP|A critical item of avoidance was one of adverse publicity from people like Madalyn Murray O'Hair (a militant atheist of the time who was then involved in a legal battle with NASA over the reading from Genesis by the Apollo 8 crew). But I think enough time has passed. I think it projects a positive image, (even though) it might not be my choice, now, of something to do during that time period.
1052608|ALSJ||Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Mrs. O'Hair's Apollo 8 lawsuit.
1052608|ALSJ||The following pair of lines are produced by an unintentional keying of the microphones. The crew is in the "Push to Talk" communications mode. Each is wearing a "Snoopy" helmet and a mike but, in order to talk, must push a button on the cable linking them to the comm panel or must squeeze a trigger on the handcontroller. The cable button is velcroed on their thigh and, if they bend forward, it's possible to press it accidentally.
1052608|ALSJ|CDR|I think we were grabbing a bite to eat, right here. Clearly, we were talking between ourselves about matters of the moment. But I don't know, specifically, what this was. It doesn't compute.
1052608|ALSJ|LMP|You kind of requested Charlie (Duke to be CapCom during the landing). Why was that? I guess we were sitting in the MOCR during (Apollo 10)...
1052608|ALSJ|CDR|I can't remember. It seems highly likely that we would have wanted to use someone who had participated in a full-mission simulation during the same sequence of practice events.
1052608|ALSJ|LMP|10 flew in May and, until after they flew, we didn't really get into our sims hot and heavy. So we didn't need to have a CapCom assigned for us, really, until after that. As I recall we didn't have any particular reason for any preference except that we agreed that Charlie had appeared to have done such a good job. 'Cause we were watching him handle the conversations with Apollo 10.
1052608|ALSJ||I then asked what constituted a "full sim".
1052608|ALSJ|CDR|It could just be LM descent, but as many people who would actually be involved in the real circumstance would be participating in their normal position. Everybody in Mission Control, the people in the backrooms, CapComs. And the crew would be in the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">simulators</a>, sometimes with both the Command Module and the Lunar Module simulators manned simultaneously."
1052608|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Mike Dinn, who was Deputy Director at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station (HSK) during Apollo writes, "In retrospect I'm amazed at the confidence we (the whole Apollo project) had, but everything possible had been done to prepare, including contingency planning."
1052608|ALSJ||Our HSK in-house sim capability came about as a result of a visit I had to Houston, when I sat in on several MOCR simulations with 'Network'. I realised that we at the Station didn't have the same depth of contingency capability as the Flight Control team. So when I got back to HSK, and with (HSK Director) Tom Reid's support, we decided to build an <a href=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/station/simulation_system.html" target="alsj">in-house capability</a> based around some excess consoles from the tracking ship <a href="../apollo.glossary.html#CSQ" target="alsj">CSQ</a> - which I selected at <a href="../apollo.glossary.html#Fremantle" target="alsj">Fremantle</a> - and various other pieces of equipment to assemble the many Apollo (radio frequency) spectrums. I even approached Howard Kyle at Houston at one point to see if we could lay our hands on an excess/spare/prototype PSP (pre-signal processor) which mixed the various signals in the CSM - but with no success. The only thing we couldn't simulate was American accents for astronaut and CAPCOM voice, so we had a number of laconic Australian voices pretending to land and step on the lunar surface. Messed it up a bit."
1052608|ALSJ||The simulations were great for building confidence. I used to say that the Apollo project used only about 5 percent of support capability for a nominal mission, but we got to 95 per cent on 13. It was THE mission when the receiver operators earned their money - sorting out the LM signal from the S-IVB on the same frequency. We had four receivers at HSK, four at Tidbinbilla and two at Parkes all trying.&quot:

1061149|ALSJ|CDR|There were a couple of reasons for trying to find the LM on the surface. I would say, first, they wanted to find out if they could see it from the Command Module. Second, they wanted to try to help in establishing its position. A lot of people were interested in where we landed, particularly those people who were involved in the descent guidance trajectory controls. After all, in later flights, we were going to try to go to specific spots on the surface and we needed to get all the information we could regarding methods that might help precision. However, in this transcript one doesn't get a feeling of concern. Certainly, it didn't affect what we did very much. Nor did people on the ground think that this was a disastrous occurrence. But, the fact was, they didn't know exactly where we were and they did want to know if they could.
1061149|ALSJ|LMP|Well, I guess it's conceivable that it could affect the ability to rendezvous. But, you know that, once you get lifted off, you're going to approach the general vicinity (of the CSM). And, as soon as you start getting (rendezvous radar) data, then that narrows down. Unless you're so far off that you never acquire him.
1061149|ALSJ|CDR|It's probably worth mentioning that the perturbations by the mascons was still of concern. They were trying to reduce the error from these uncertainties to the point that we could have increasing confidence about going to a particular point on the surface.
1061149|ALSJ||Mascons, or "mass concentrations" are local variations in the lunar crustal density which produces irregularities in the lunar gravitational field which, in turn, perturb spacecraft orbits. Mascons are generally associated with the mare and were discovered when it was noticed that the orbits of the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft varied in what were, at first, unpredictable ways. By the time of Apollo 11, experts were beginning to get a handle on orbital perturbations in the equatorial belt. However, outside that belt, there was too little data to build accurate models and, when it came time to fly Apollos 15 and 17, the two missions that would land well away from the equator, perturbation of the orbits of those two Command Modules could not be predicted with any confidence.

It was an area where we wanted to feel very confident about having done the proper procedures. Of course, we didn't develop these procedures by ourselves. It was done by an entire group. But we used them in all our ground simulations and accepted them as being reasonable.

This conversation indicates that Mike is applying the name to the collection of craters in a square bounded by the M, R, 6, and 10 lines, as I have indicated on the LAM-2G <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11P02-63.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a>.
1070531|ALSJ||Mike may have mentioned the "middle finger" to ensure he and Bruce were reading the map the same way. Evidently, he's a bit amused that they are trying to pinpoint a location based on a pattern that only faintly resembles a cat's paw print.
1070531|ALSJ||Phil Stooke notes that, in an untitled, post-flight, Manned Spacecraft Center <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/apollo11site2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">graphic</a> he found in the library at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, the larger craters in the area Mike and Bruce have been discussing, especially the largest one that is shaped like a half-moon, are part of a pattern labeled 'The Z'.
1070531|ALSJ|CDR|I think <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/coas.htm" target="alsj">COAS</a> means 'optical alignment sight' or something like that. (To Buzz) Do you remember?"
1070531|ALSJ|LMP|I didn't have one. (General laughter)

1071015|ALSJ||Long Comm Break
1071015|ALSJ||David Woods tells us that the unit known as two-forty ( or 2.40 ) is a glycol evaporator control, which is to the left of center and slightly down in the large diagram on page 2.7-25 (PDF page 25) in the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aoh/aoh-v1-2-07-ecs.pdf" target="alsj">Block II Apollo Operations Handbook</a>. David writes, "I suspect the function of this controller is to adjust the valve that controls the steam pressure in the steam vent of the evaporator. This steam pressure affects how much heat is lost through evaporation. If the evaporators are needed, the system will know this because the outlet temperature will rise. The steam vent valve will open, allow more evaporation and the coolant (glycol) outlet temperature will fall."
1071015|ALSJ||Long Comm Break
1073041|ALSJ||They are getting Buzz into his PLSS. NASA Public Affairs informs the press that the crew is running about 30 minutes behind schedule.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|Now, a preliminary comment (on the EVA Preps) has to do with the longer time that it took than during our simulations. It is attributable to the fact that, when you do simulations of EVA Prep, you have a clean cockpit and you have all the things that you're going to use there in the cockpit and nothing else. In reality, you have a lot of checklists, data, food packages, stowage places filled with odds and ends, binoculars, stop watches, and assorted things, each of which you feel obliged to evaluate as to whether its stowage position is satisfactory for EVA, and whether you might want to change anything from the pre-flight plans. For example, our mission timer was out, and we decided we had better leave one wristwatch inside in case it (the one taken outside) got damaged. We would have at least one working watch to back up the mission timer or to use in place of the mission timer, in case we could not get it going again.
1073041|ALSJ||The astronauts each had an Omega <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/omega.html" target="alsj">Speedmaster Professional</a>. Neil's can be seen on his right forearm in training photo <a href="ap11-S69-32234HR.jpg" target="alsj">S69-32234</a>.
1073041|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that, contrary to Neil's statement above, "there were no binoculars onboard. They had a 10x40 monocular manufactured by Leitz, Germany, and modified by NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) Houston. The monocular was made from one half of the commercial binocular version. Contrary to the stowage list the monocular was transferred from the CM to the LM prior to undocking and was used on the moon both before and after the EVA. Later missions had a monocular stowed in the LM. Thus the Leitz-monocular used on the Apollo 11 mission was the first telescopic viewing device used on another celestial body. It is interesting to note that, unlike Omega and Hasselblad, the Leitz Company never really used their Apollo role in their advertising."
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|All these items took a little bit of time, a little bit of discussion - which never showed up in any of our EVA Preps on the ground - really accounted for the better part of an hour of additional time. Our view of EVA Prep was that we were not trying to meet a time schedule. We were just trying to do each item and do it right sequentially and not worry about the time. Well, the result was, a lot of additional time was used there. I don't think that's wrong. I just think in future planning, you are probably better off adding time for these kinds of things.
1073041|ALSJ|LMP|No matter how many times you run through an EVA Prep, to the best of the instructor's ability to put things in a logical sequence, when you're faced with doing these things, there is a natural tendency to deviate somewhat from the printed sequence that you have. It's a rather complex operation. Nobody writes a checklist to tell you in the morning when you get up all the sequences you go through to put your clothes on, brush your teeth, shave, and all that. If you had one (that is, a morning checklist) setting there, you wouldn't follow it the same every day. You would make small deviations just based on what seems appropriate at that time. It is a very difficult thing to build a checklist for.
1073041|ALSJ||The EVA checklists for later missions were much less detailed, partly because crews had more time in training to become familiar with the necessary procedures, and partly to allow for a certain amount of flexibility. Certainly, the critical steps were always included but, otherwise, trivial steps like "Turn right and back into PLSS" (see page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur28.gif" target="alsj">Sur-28</a>, near the middle) were eliminated.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|We shouldn't imply that the EVA preparation checklist wasn't good and adequate. We did, in fact, follow it pretty much to the letter, just the way we had done during <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training exercises</a>. That is, the hook ups, and where we put the equipment, and the checks were done precisely as per our checklist. And it was very good. I don't have any complaints about that at all. It's these other little things that you don't think about and didn't consider that took more time than we thought."
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|There was one control on the PLSS that surprised us. I don't know if it was different from the trainers or the flight PLSSs at the time we were looking at them or not, but there was a press-to-test knob of some sort that neither of us could correctly identify as to function. At this time, we aren't really quite sure what it does.
1073041|ALSJ|LMP|It was a thumb depress button that seemed to go in somewhere as if it was relieving some pressure from something. I can't remember ever having seen that before. It protruded out toward your back and looked as if it might come fairly close to riding on the back of the suit.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|We both thought we knew the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit, consisting of the suit, the backpack, the Oxygen Purge System, etc.) very well and knew every function and how it operated. But it turned out we were wrong. It was something that we hadn't learned there, and if it had been there before, somehow it escaped us. It took a little time to discuss that, and we proceeded.
1073041|ALSJ|LMP|We had problems with this one particular electrical connector, the one that joins the RCU to the PLSS, ever since the first time we'd ever seen it.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|It's about a 50-pin Bendix connector.
1073041|ALSJ|LMP|It's just very difficult to get the thing positioned properly so that the three pins on the outside, the three little protuberances, will engage in the ramp so that, when you then twist, it'll cinch in. That must have taken at least 10 minutes. The problem was not with mine, but in hooking up Neil's. I can't say that there was much difference in the many times I tried it unsuccessfully and the one time it did go in correctly. It appeared to be squared away each time.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|This is not because we didn't understand the problem. We had had trouble with that connector for 2 years or more. We'd always complained about it. It had never been re-designed, and it was usually ascribed to that fact that all the training models were old and gouged, and so on. But when we looked at the flight units during CCFF (Crew Compartment Fit and Function) on the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit, the suit, backpack, etc.), it turned out they were still difficult. We accepted the fact that, by being very careful with that connector, we could, in fact, connect and disconnect it satisfactorily. We did that in the lab at the Cape. We had a little bit of difficulty with it there.
1073041|ALSJ||The EMU CCFF was done in a large room at the Cape on 25 June 1969 ( <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTrainingSummaries.pdf" target="alsj">3 Mb PDF</a> ). No one is wearing hair coverings or gloves, but the room is clean, as can be seen in NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38488.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-38488</a>. Photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38497HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-38497</a> shows Neil being fitted with a strap-on thigh pocket. He is wearing the flight units of the suit and PLSS. A counter-weighted suspension device is bearing the weight of the PLSS although, evidently, a cable has come off its pulley. A training version of the electrical connector is seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../uliracu02HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">side view</a> and a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../uliracu03HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">front view</a> photographed by Ulli Lotzmann at the Smithsonian Institution's Garber facility in 2005.
1073041|ALSJ|CDR|When we got to the lunar surface, it was the same problem. It took us at least 10 minutes each to mate those connectors. It's the big electrical cable from the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> to the PLSS. It attaches at the PLSS end. It's our recommendation that it's a sufficiently serious problem that we can't afford to jeopardize the success of an EVA on that connector. And that's, right now (on the day of the briefing), what we're betting. It began to look like we never would get those connectors mated on the surface. We just have to improve that."
1073041|ALSJ||As a result of the Apollo 11 experience, the connector was successfully re-designed. The following is taken from the Apollo 11 Mission Report. "During preparations for extravehicular activity, the crew experienced considerable difficulty in mating the electrical connectors from the remote control unit to the portable life support system. For rotational polarization alignment, it was necessary to grasp the cable insulation because the coupling lock ring was free for unlimited rotation on the connector shell (see figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf16-22.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">16-22</a>). For future missions, the male half of the connector has been replaced with one which has a coupling ring with a positive rotation position with the connector shell and can be grasped for firm alignment of the two halves. The ring is then rotated 90 degrees to capture and lock. In addition, easier insertion has been attained with conical tipped contact pins in place of hemispherical tipped pins."
1080053|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Phil Karn writes, "The normal S-band mode, PM (phase modulation), carried voice, telemetry and ranging but could not support TV. Switching to FM (frequency modulation) enabled television. It also disabled ranging but this was not needed on the lunar surface. Switching to FM also meant that the large 210-foot dishes at Goldstone and Parkes were now necessary even to receive voice from Eagle; in the PM mode the smaller 85-foot antennas sufficed for voice. Needless to say, the Apollo 11 mission had unquestioned priority for all ground station resources."
1080053|ALSJ|CDR|Someone asked me if I had left my wristwatch in the Lunar Module during the EVA as a backup to the mission timer; and I couldn't remember. But that seemed like a logical suggestion.
1080053|ALSJ|LMP|That jibes with what I remember: your electing not to take it out on the surface was because of (the mission timer).
1080053|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that, according to an Omega brochure, Neil mentioned leaving his watch in the LM to NASA Historian Alan A. Nelson.
1080053|ALSJ||They are at the top of checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur30.gif" target="alsj">Sur-30</a>, both having gotten their PLSSs and RCUs on. Next, they will make sure that they have good comm from both PLSSs and will check to make sure that various sensors and warning flags and tones are operational.
1080053|ALSJ||The VOX is the voice-activated comm system. They seem to have been checking it and finally have it working. Neil is making a joking reference to gunfighters in the American Old West, possibly referring to his own slow response to Buzz.
1080053|ALSJ||They are in the middle of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur31.gif" target="alsj">Sur-31</a>. Each of them has a foot-long flat-wire antenna on the top of the backpack. When not in use, it is held down by a loop of fabric velcroed to the top surface of the OPS. Nominally, in the interest of not breaking it off as they move around inside the LM and crawl through the hatch, they would leave the antenna lying flat until they were outside; but, as here, if comm is poor, the checklist suggests raising the antenna.
1080053|ALSJ||Houston has re-acquired Columbia as it came into view around the eastern limb of the Moon.
1080053|ALSJ||These <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/rcu_top.jpeg" title="image" target="alsj">warning flags</a> are on the top of the Remote Control Unit (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a>) and indicate that there is no oxygen flow and that the suit isn't pressurized. At this point in the EVA preps, Neil and Buzz are merely checking to see that the warning system is working properly.
1080053|ALSJ||They have just finished <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur31.gif" target="alsj">Sur-31</a>.
1080053|ALSJ||Now that they are on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/PLSSComm.pdf" target="alsj">PLSS comm</a>, the path is from Houston through the LM to the PLSS antennas, then back through the LM <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_eva_antenna_en.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">EVA antenna</a> (which they raised earlier) and on to Houston.
1080053|ALSJ||At the top of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur30.gif" target="alsj">Sur-30</a>, they closed the TV circuit breaker so that Houston could make sure that they were getting a good signal. The TV is inside the MESA (Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly) which is folded up against the side of the LM just to the north of the ladder. In addition to the TV, the MESA contains the rock boxes and various tools. Once he crawls backwards out of the hatch, Neil will reach to his left and, by pulling on a lanyard, will release a latch at the top of the MESA, letting it swing down into position and, in the process, point the TV at the bottom of the ladder.
1080053|ALSJ||Comm Break
1080053|ALSJ||Comm Break
1080053|ALSJ||Now that Houston is getting a good signal from the TV, they want to turn it off so that it doesn't overheat in the well-insulated confines of the MESA. They will turn it on again when Neil is ready to go out. Evidently, Neil and Buzz overlooked that step on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur32.gif" target="alsj">Sur-32</a> and Bruce is reminding them, without calling attention to the mistake.
1080053|ALSJ|LMP|The initial comm checkout on the audio panel and the various communications checks that we made in the FM mode all seemed to go quite well, until we started switching the PLSS modes. For a while, we ascribed some of the difficulty perhaps to the antenna being stowed. So we unstowed Neil's, and that didn't help immediately. A little later, it seemed to help out, but then we got back into about the same problem, so I stowed his antenna. There didn't seem to be any particular rhyme or reason to when we did appear to have good comm and when we didn't.
1080053|ALSJ|CDR|It suffices to say that we never did understand what was required to enable good comm while we were inside the cockpit, relaying through the PLSSs. We had it part of the time, and we didn't part of the time. We tried a lot of various options, and they just weren't universally successful. But we were able to have adequate comm to enable us to continue. I think, once outside, we really didn't have any appreciable comm problems at all. It seemed to work quite well.
1080053|ALSJ||On the later missions, the quality of PLSS-relayed comm from the cabin was also erratic. Generally, raising the antennas in the cabin didn't help much. With regard to comm during the EVA, Neil's was excellent but Buzz's tended to be broken, most likely because the sensitivity of the VOX circuitry was not set to its maximum value. The control was not set properly prior to the EVA; and, although it might have been brushed by one of the PLSSs, Ken Glover notes that, at 108:08:30, Buzz appears to have reduced the volume setting. None of the later crews experienced a similar problem.
1080053|ALSJ||In the interest of caution, the Flight Director is making a final check of all systems before giving the Go. Neil and Buzz are starting the paragraph "Final Systems Prep for Egress" on page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur32.gif" target="alsj">Sur-32</a>. They have attached their OPS oxygen hoses to the PLSSs and the OPS actuator cables to the RCUs. Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-32234HR.jpg" target="alsj">S69-32234</a> shows Buzz's OPS actuator on the left side of his RCU mockup.
1080053|ALSJ||I, for one, remember getting excited at this point in the proceedings, thinking that they were close to opening the hatch. In reality, they still have to configure the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">LM ECS</a> (Environmental Control System) for the depress, get their helmets on, get themselves off of LM oxygen, cooling water, and comm, hook themselves up to the PLSSs, and get their gloves on. It will be another half hour before they start the depress.
1080053|ALSJ||Neil is turning off the fan which circulates oxygen through the ECS. He and Buzz will be able to hear the fan stop running but soon will also note two caution lights, again as a test of the caution-and-warning system.
1080053|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">LM ECS</a> is controlled with a combination of circuit breakers located on the panel at Buzz's right shoulder and by various valves located on the ECS cabinet located behind Buzz's station. Some of the valves are located on the forward surface and some on the inboard surface. With both of them wearing PLSSs and their freedom of motion restricted, it is Neil who operates most of the ECS valves, reaching across with his right hand.
1080053|ALSJ|CDR|It was easier for me to see the controls and to reach them.
1080053|ALSJ||With the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter Valve</a> in Egress, they are cutting off the flow of oxygen from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> to the cabin. The Diverter Valve has a push/pull control.
1080053|ALSJ||They are waiting for the caution-and-warning system to sense that the ECS fan and the airflow-driven water separator have stopped operating. This typically takes 4 minutes.
1080053|ALSJ||Houston is reminding Buzz to turn off a sensor which detects a pressure difference across the fan, another indication of whether or not the fan is running. They had skipped over that step.
1080053|ALSJ||They are verifying that there can be no flow from the cabin into the ECS.
1082505|ALSJ||With flow in the ECS turned off, the centrifugal water separator also stopped working and they are now seeing a caution light indicating that the separator has spun down. They will now start the tasks on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur33.gif" target="alsj">Sur-33</a>.
1082505|ALSJ||They are shutting off the flow of oxygen from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> into the suits. The valves are behind Buzz but fairly low and it is easiest for Neil to reach across with his right hand.
1082505|ALSJ||Each of the hose connectors has a ring lock and then, built into the ring, a "lock-lock" which prevents the ring from accidentally rotating open.
1082505|ALSJ||Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38499HR.jpg" target="alsj">S69-38499</a> shows Neil working on Buzz's connections during training.
1082505|ALSJ||Next, Buzz connects Neil's OPS hose.
1082606|ALSJ||The purge valve is mounted on the right side of the chest and can be opened in the case that the PLSS fails and the astronaut has to use the emergency oxygen supply stored in the OPS. In the event of a PLSS failure, the astronaut would open the purge valve by pulling the so-called <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5903_oxygen_purge_valve_en.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Red Apple</a>, which pulled a lock pin out of the purge valve, and then use the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../rcudiag1b.jpg" title="drawing" target="alsj">OPS actuator</a> mounted on the side of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> which would let oxygen flow out of the OPS, through a regulator, into the suit, and then out through the purge valve. The valve has two flow settings: a low flow rate of 4 pounds per hour and a high flow of 8 pounds per hour, the choice depending on the availability of cooling. The OPS contains roughly four pounds of oxygen, giving either a one-hour or thirty-minute supply.
1082606|ALSJ||During the trip out from Earth, the purge valves were stowed in the lunar overshoes (aka Moon Boots). As indicated on LM Lunar Surface checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur27.gif" target="alsj">Sur-27</a>, after removing the boots from their stowage locations, the purge valves were retrieved and stowed in the middle pocket of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11FlownISA.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Interim Stowage Assembly (ISA)</a>.

1082716|ALSJ||Neil may be changing the purge valve orientation so that the Red Apple - which Buzz would grab and pull to open his purge valve - is in easy reach. In EVA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a115903Red_Apple.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS11-40-5903</a> Buzz's Red Apple is at the center of his suit at about navel height.
1082716|ALSJ||As shown in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg" target="alsj">Figure I-23</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/A14EMU-v1.pdf" target="alsj">EMU Handbook</a>, the diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector. The valve has two positions. In the Open (horizontal) position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso. In the Closed (vertical) position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/A14EMUv1fI-10.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.
1082835|ALSJ|LMP| title=image" target="alsj">Snoopy cap</a>" or, more formally, the "Communications Carrier". "Snoopy" is Charlie Brown's beagle in the comic strip "Peanuts" drawn by Charles Schulz. Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann had discussions with Ernie Reyes in mid-2000 about Snoopy's association with Apollo. Reyes was Chief of the Pre-Flight Operations Branch at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston during Apollo; and Lotzmann reports that Reyes, Wayne Stallard and others drew little cartoons on the daily schedules to make them more interesting.

Because the cartoons were never intended for commercial publication, Reyes never asked Schultz for permission to use the character. After the Apollo 1 fire, Snoopy became the symbol of the revitalized NASA safety program.

1082835|ALSJ||Note that, in the following, they get Buzz into his helmet first, as per checklist.
1082835|ALSJ||They have turned on Buzz's PLSS fan to start the flow of oxygen through the suit. A clear vent window indicates that the flow is adequate. In the event of inadequate flow, a "P" would appear in the window, indicating that Buzz should activate his OPS and open his Purge Valve.

1082835|ALSJ||Neil is checking to see that the back flap on Buzz's LEVA is properly covering his neck ring.
1082835|ALSJ|LMP|I think we should have brought the boots back and not the LEVAs. It was a last minute decision and they're not as publicly appreciated as the boots are.
1082835|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that Neil and Buzz brought their EVA gloves back to Earth.
1082835|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that page 183 of the Apollo 11 Press Kit contains the following statement under the heading Contamination Control. "The equipment shown in table I as jettisoned equipment will be assembled and bagged to be subsequently left on the lunar surface. The lunar boots, likely the most contaminated items, will be placed in a bag as early as possible (after the EVA) to minimize the spread of lunar particles (in the cabin)."
1083346|ALSJ||During the 1991 mission review, we turned to a discussion of the EVA checklists that they had out on the surface.
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|When we were out on the surface, the only thing we had was whatever you (Neil) had on your wrist. We didn't have stuff for outside the cabin. We didn't take the checklist and we didn't have a lot of extensive things at all for the outside.
1083346|ALSJ|CDR|I had a very abbreviated checklist of all the major items that we were going to do, in the order that we had planned to do them. Setting up the various experiments and getting the samples...
1083346|ALSJ||Jones - "A single page?"
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|I think, in retrospect, we could have done better in the outside the cabin prompting system.
1083346|ALSJ||Jones - "On the later missions, they had what was, essentially, a little <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/ap13-KSC-70PC-18.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">spiral notebook</a> bent slightly over the wrist so that the pages would stay open. Yours was more primitive than that?"
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|Oh, much more.
1083346|ALSJ|CDR|No pages.
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|It may have even been sewn on, or something. I don't know that I had any thing like that. Although I should have. I think we both should have had a set of outside cues.
1083346|ALSJ||In reality, they each had a checklist page sewn to the gauntlet of the left glove. Neil's cuff checklist can be seen in NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38889.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-38889</a> and in a detail from <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.s69_38898det.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-38898</a>. Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann calls attention to the fact that, during training, Neil and Buzz used strap-on checklist cards, as can be seen in NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-69-H-666.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">69-H-666</a>.
1083346|ALSJ||The RCU is the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/rcu_top.jpeg" title="image" target="alsj">Remote Control Unit</a>, a small box worn on the chest which has PLSS and Comm controls, the oxygen gauge and assorted warning flags.
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|With all this comm problem, and that being so essential, (it is unfortunate) we (had) overlooked dress rehearsals that included that sort of stuff.
1083346|ALSJ|CDR|You might ask Gene (Cernan) if he remembers doing any of that (suited comm checks during Apollo 10). My guess is that they focused on the things they had to do...
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean that they had to do a depressurization when the LM was separated from the CSM. They could have done that in a safer condition but with the same equipment after they joined back up again.
1083346|ALSJ||Jones - "Didn't Rusty don the backpack on 9?"
1083346|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah, he did. But I don't think he went through a lot of this VOX communication period.
1083346|ALSJ||Jones - "He probably stayed hooked up to the LM, but I can check that."
1083346|ALSJ||In the raw, Apollo 9 Technical Air-to-Ground transcript, at 71:56, Schweikart prepares to unplug his LM comm cable and to connect his PLSS comm unbilical so he can do a comm check with McDivitt, who is with him in the LM and with Dave Scott in the CM. VOX is mentioned.

1083346|ALSJ||The light in question may be one or both of the two utility lamps which had long, gold-colored cords and could hung at various places around the cabin when needed. At the top of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur26.gif" target="alsj">Sur-26</a>, they secured the utility lights to the guard cage surrounding the Alignment Optical Telescope (AOT); but they may have moved one or both since then.

One of the lamps is over Neil's head, hanging from the yellow bar (aka PLSS Upper Mounting Station Pin) used as a pulley mount when operating the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-lec.html" target="alsj">LEC</a>). The other lamp is somwhere on Buzz's side of the spacecraft, below his window.
1083648|ALSJ||Houston gets a modest amount of telemetry from the PLSS, including electrocardiogram readouts, suit pressure, carbon dioxide partial pressure, battery voltage and current, oxygen bottle pressure, temperatures at the inlet to the Liquid Cooled Garment (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lcg-tubes.jpg" target="alsj">LCG</a>) and the outlet to the PLSS sublimator, and a temperature difference between the LCG inlet and outlet. Houston does not have a direct indication of the status of the vent window - which shows a "P" warning when the oxygen flow is below about 5 cubic feet per minute - and had to remind Neil to give them a report. As per checklist (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur33.gif" target="alsj">Sur-33</a>), at 108:30:53 Buzz reported that his vent window had cleared. See the commentary following 108:45:51 for a further discussion of the LCG and the PLSS sublimator.
1083648|ALSJ||Having stowed the Lunar Surface Checklist, they will now go through the procedures on EVA Card No. 1.
1083836|ALSJ|LMP|The hoses both came from the same place (behind Buzz), and yours were longer and went across and mine sort of came around to the right.
1083836|ALSJ|CDR|(To stow the hoses out of the way), I would guess (we put them somewhere) in the ECS area.
1083836|ALSJ||Bruce is asking if Mike saw the LM.
1084210|ALSJ||Several of the crews noted radio interference during Command Module passes over their landing sites. Because of the small radius of the Moon and the low orbit of the Command Module, the CSM is above the local horizon for only about 12 minutes out of each two hour orbit.
1084210|ALSJ||During this pass over the landing site, Mike tried the three locations passed up to him at the indicated times: M.8/8.2 ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1064417" target="alsj">106:44:17</a> ), P.2/6.3 ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1070531" target="alsj">107:05:31</a> ), and M.7/8.0 ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1071015" target="alsj">107:10:15</a> ). The first and last of these are virtually identical to the estimated latitude and longitude for the LM that Charlie gave to Mike at about <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1042042" target="alsj">104:20:42</a>. That lat/long corresponds to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#flownLAM2" target="alsj">map</a> coordinates M.5/8.0 and, because the sextant field-of view corresponds to a circle on the ground 3.2 km in diameter, the differences between M.5/8.0, M.8/8.2, and M.7/8.0 are inconsequential. Near these locations, Mike drew a small circle in pencil with an arrow pointing to it. There is a very small crater at the center of the circle and this may be the 'tiny crater' Mike described at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1044248" target="alsj">104:42:48</a>.
1084551|ALSJ||This is a pump which circulates water through a network of thin tubes woven into the Liquid Cooled Garment or <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lcg-tubes.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LCG</a>. This is a closed-loop water supply which carries excess body heat to the sublimator where the heat is transferred to a supply of feedwater which is subsequently evaporated to provide overall cooling. They won't turn on the sublimator feedwater supply until after the hatch is open because the sublimator needs to be in a vacuum for proper operation. On Apollo 12, after the crew had the hatch open and Pete Conrad was down on the surface, Al Bean accidentally knocked the hatch closed and the very small cabin pressure created by the operation of the sublimator was enough to trigger a warning flag.
1084551|ALSJ|CDR|The sublimator was not working but the water temperature was cooler than our skin temperature so, as soon as we had water circulating at its normal temperature we felt the result of it.
1084551|ALSJ||See the discussion at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1084210" target="alsj">108:42:10</a>. 'Both locations' probably refers to (1) the location P.2/6.3 suggested to him at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1070531" target="alsj">107:05:31</a> and (2) the vicinity of nearly coincident points M.8/8.2 and M.7/8.0 suggested at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1064417" target="alsj">106:44:17</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html#1071015" target="alsj">107:10:15</a>
1084551|ALSJ||The actual landing site is about Juliett 0.65/ 7.52. Each of the grid squares is a kilometer on a side and Echo 0.3/4.8 is, therefore, about 4.4 kilometers south and 2.6 kilometers west of the actual spot. As can be seen in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#a11mrf514" target="alsj">Figure 5-14</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mr.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Mission Report</a>, this is Houston's worst estimate. Bruce will give Mike the Auto Optics settings at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mobility.html#1101839" target="alsj">110:18:39</a>, and he will examine the location during the pass over the landing site at 110:33:40 and reports the negative result at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mobility.html#1103506" target="alsj">110:36:58</a>.
1084551|ALSJ|CDR|That was quite a distance away from the point they had been looking. Previously, they had been looking up in the Mike area, which is a substantial distance away.
1084551|ALSJ|LMP|When he read it back that way, he was sort of hinting, 'Hey, dummy, you're not supposed to read it up that way'.
1084551|ALSJ||Comm Break
1084551|ALSJ||During the 1991 mission review, I put the following question to Neil and Buzz and was so fascinated by Buzz's lengthy answer that I have included the entire exchange here. My question was "On the way home from dinner last night, my wife and I were talking a little bit about a difference in perception: namely that, from the public's point of view, the stuff that's about to happen, the two of you going outside on the surface, the first footprints, and so on is the exciting stuff; whereas, from the program point of view, the goal of the mission is the landing and return, demonstrating the capabilities of the spacecraft. Do you have any comments about that?"
1084551|ALSJ|CDR|As I've always said, the highlight for me, personally, was the final descent and landing. That was, after all, our major objective and it was a very difficult and risky, complex part of the flight. And I, personally, not being a geologist and so on, saw no special challenge in the surface work, which was something appropriate to do but, in my mind, never had the importance of the landing itself. (Chuckling) From a pilot's perspective.
1084551|ALSJ|LMP|I'm a transportation person, primarily. An operator of vehicles who found myself thrust into the situation of suited spacewalks - or EVAs - on Gemini 12 and Apollo 11. And I found that my preparation was most adequate for that. There's no doubt that the single most significant achievement on our flight was our descent to a foreign surface and the ascent to orbit to complete a rendezvous, join up, and come back.
1084551|ALSJ||Outside-the-spacecraft activities (EVAs), in my estimation, are easier in a gravitational field than they are in free flight conditions with people floating around. And I think our evidence of (the need for) energy management in the learning process for EVAs (during <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html" target="alsj">Gemini</a> and into Apollo) speaks to that."
1084551|ALSJ||My concern about how the public is influenced by the media has, of course, been growing. One doesn't necessarily agree with where that leads us, but you have to learn to live with it. My mis-guess about Apollo (EVAs) was confirmed by another guy who walked on the Moon (an unnamed astronaut but not, obviously, Alan Shepard) and that is that we felt that hitting a golf ball on the Moon was a waste of taxpayers' money and that that was not an appropriate thing to be done on a manned mission. But we have both agreed that we were wrong. That's what the public wants to see. They want people (that is, astronauts) to do those kinds of activities and that promotes a positive support system for the things that we were trying to do. So, obviously, we have to change our thinking about that and get behind that.
1084551|ALSJ||Clearly the public was interested and fascinated by the moment of putting a foot on another planet, whether (or not) you've been there for hours, working over kind of boring procedures, getting ready to go outside. That doesn't seem to have anything to do with it. Rather facetiously, I've constructed a lunar lander for the future that has two exits and two ladders so that both people can come down at precisely the same time. Now, there are some good reasons why you might want two airlocks on a vehicle; but if, in front of engineers, I start suggesting a lunar landing craft with two ladders so that the two guys go down together, it's liable to be looked at in a facetious way and the sound engineering will be set aside because of the facetious nature with which someone might interpret what I'm trying to say.
1084551|ALSJ||I think that the invasion of the press and the media into the innards of what we're trying to do in exploration is good, but it also has to be dealt with appropriately. And, on that particular subject: if I had had the role of being the first person to make an utterance, I'm sure that what I would have done, in retrospect, would have been to consult the most competent advisors - on my time - absorbed their advice and have come up with whatever I wanted to do and say, based on that. And that's what Presidents do when they give a State of the Union, and that's what anyone else does. And, yet, somehow, that doesn't appear to be available to us to do, without it being judged as interference from the outside. Okay? And I think that's a sorry situation. Of course, I've given that subject a lot of thought. I think that, for people to press Neil about where and how he came up with a very clever (statement for the occasion)....is no business of theirs. But it indicates a need to have a line drawn somewhere.
1084551|ALSJ||Again, facetiously, about the order in which people get out, I guess it was confirmed...or, a selection was fairly strongly confirmed...by looking at the emergency positions as being based on where the hinge was on the hatch. Well, in the future, things of this nature are going to be anticipated, I'm sure; and we get a little smarter. But, then there'll be something else that will crop up to trouble us.
1084551|ALSJ||But, I think, the public perception is where our support's going to come from; and, harnessing that, and maintaining that at its proper edge and inspiring people to new careers and not having them come into a career field and dedicate themselves to an experiment and then have that experiment postponed and postponed and postponed and then it never flies. And the person feels like he's really been let down in life by the system. And that can be very damaging, and I think that's happened in many cases. That there's an over-anticipation. We keep crying that we need more and more engineers and, when people do studies, that doesn't necessarily seem to be the case. If we needed a whole lot more engineers, we'd be paying them a lot more money to get good engineers, it would seem to me. (Chuckling) While I'm on the subject, I'll take a moment or two more and talk about the term NASA scientist". The public perceives the word 'NASA scientist' as being the guy who builds rockets. Well, these are engineers; they're not scientists. And, because of that perception, we now have a space station that's being dedicated to science and it is really an engineering necessity. And it is not being judged by the Academy of Engineering as to its adequacy and its ability to fulfill what's needed. It's, again, being judged by the Academy of Sciences for its scientific content which really means 'Does it do the kind of experiments that these people want to see happen regardless of whether it fulfills the role of engineering long-term soundness'. Now, all of these things, I think, have to do with public perception and that, I think, is what your question was."
1084551|ALSJ||Readers interested in the question of how the decision was made as to who went out first should consult Andy Chaikin's excellent book "A Man on the Moon", together with Buzz's "Return to Earth". In the simplest terms, the decision hinged (if my readers will pardon the pun) on the design of the hatch, which swung into the cabin to the right, blocking Buzz's access to the exit until after Neil was out. Despite this engineering reality, Buzz expended some effort prior to the flight in trying to convince Deke Slayton, the former Mercury astronaut who was Director of Flight Crew Operations, and others that he, rather than Neil, be the one to go out first. His efforts were in vain.
1084551|ALSJ||It has been about five minutes since the last comm from the LM. At that time, Neil and Buzz had turned on their PLSS water pumps. On later missions, after setting the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_press_reg_a_b.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">A & B Pressure Regulators</a> to Egress and verifying the CB panel configurations, the crews pressurized the suits and performed a pressure integrity check. In the following dialog, it seems likely that Neil and Buzz have been experiencing some comm problems. However, by 108:53:00, they are ready to close the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_repress_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">cabin repress valve</a> and to open the forward dump valve. Clearly, they have pressurized their suits. The Final EVA Configuration Cards will tell us if they planned to do a pressure integrity check
1085300|ALSJ||By closing this valve and opening a corresponding circuit breaker, they are keeping the ECS from repressurizing the cabin after they open the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="alsj">forward hatch</a>.
1085327|ALSJ||With two people in suits and backpacks, it wasn't going to be easy to lean down far enough to reach the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/forward_dump_valve.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="alsj">dump valve</a> built into the forward hatch. The photo shows the dump valve on LTA-1, displayed at the Cradle of Aviation Museum without a bacterial filter.
1085327|ALSJ|LMP|That's probably why Neil said what he did, and maybe I was too optimistic.
1085327|ALSJ||On some flights, the Commander opened the valve and on some flights it was the LMP. On Apollos 16 and 17, Duke and Cernan, respectively, reached up and back to open the overhead <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a>. We talked a little about the difficulty Gene described in getting into position to work the overhead valve, and Neil said "I believe that. And my guess is that's probably true both pressurized and unpressurized. But pressurized would probably be worse." Buzz added, "It'd be barely possible." In order to open the dump valve in the hatch, one or the other of them will have to bend either his knees or his waist and get low enough to reach the valve. After some puzzlement over the dialog, we concluded that it was Buzz who opened the valve. Part of the problem was that the start of the next line of dialog was originally transcribed as "Okay, I want to go to Dump..." whereas I now believe that "Okay, we want..." is correct.
1085327|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ken Glover notes that, at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1141028" target="alsj">114:10:28</a> during the depressurization prior to the equipment jettison, Neil reported that they used the forward <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> down to 2 psi (pounds per square inch) and then opened the overhead valve as well, undoubtedly to speed things along. Because both Neil and Buzz are right-handed, it was probably Neil, standing on the left side of the cabin, who opened the overhead valve. See, also, the discussion after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1134623" target="alsj">113:46:23</a>.
1085327|ALSJ||Once Buzz has the valve open, he will leave it open until the cabin pressure has dropped to 3.5 psi. At that point, Buzz will close the valve again so that he and Neil can watch their suits respond. The drop in cabin pressure increases the relative suit pressure to above 4.5 psi.
1085327|ALSJ||In listening to this line, all three of us concluded that it was Buzz who opened the valve.
1085327|ALSJ|CDR|I think so.
1085327|ALSJ|LMP|How could I have read the numbers, then? Come back up, again, and read them.
1085327|ALSJ|CDR|I guess you must have.
1085327|ALSJ||The latter is the pressure in the ECS which, for now, is isolated from both the cabin and the suits.
1085540|ALSJ||Buzz is wearing his watch on his suit sleeve and, apparently, starts his stopwatch function at 56 minutes after the hour, corresponding to the upcoming Ground Elapsed Time of 108:56.
1085540|ALSJ|LMP|I'm sure that Neil didn't wear his watch out on the surface. I'm sure he put it with the Velcro strap up in the AOT.
1085540|ALSJ|CDR|Someone, perhaps in correspondence, asked me about that. And I could not remember, although it seems quite logical, given the mission timer situation, that we would have left one watch inside.
1085540|ALSJ|LMP|I wasn't sure what the reason was, but I thought it was okay. It was your watch, if you wanted to leave it inside. I remember that specifically at that time, because I reflected back on it a little later when I shipped my watch to the Smithsonian and it turned up missing. That's when it refreshed in my mind, years ago, that you had left yours inside and mine was the only one out on the surface. It was one of those things...I had a watch on but I don't think I looked at it. Which would probably say that I should have had it set at something so that it was just not a normal time going around, but going from some specific...It was a lousy watch to have on the surface. It just didn't give good numbers as far as a stopwatch type thing. To have gone to all that expense and then to have crews out on the surface with just an ordinary watch, in retrospect, is a mistaken priority somewhere.
1085540|ALSJ||Jones - "The later crews had cuff checklists set up with timing relative to depressurization. They would start the stop-watch function at depress."
1085540|ALSJ|CDR|Seems logical.
1085540|ALSJ|LMP|Well, since we didn't have a checklist that was set up on (elapsed EVA) time, why we didn't get to cement in that kind of a procedure. But that's a very good one.
1085622|ALSJ||Sensors in the PLSSs have noted that, although the cabin pressure is low, the sublimators are not yet working. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/plss/plss04.jpg" target="alsj">sublimator</a> consists of a sandwich of honeycomb plates on which, when exposed to vacuum, the feedwater turns to ice and it is the sublimation of the ice layer that provides cooling. The astronauts will not start the flow of feedwater until they get the hatch open and, by noting the warnings, they are making sure that the sensors are working.
1085622|ALSJ||Comm Break
1085622|ALSJ||For Apollo 11, the forward <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> is equipped with a bacterial filter which is having a considerable effect on the speed of decompression. The filters will not be flown on subsequent missions. With the filter in place, cabin pressure drops from 5.0 pounds per square inch, absolute (psia) to 0.08 psia in 310 seconds versus 180 seconds without the filter. Use of both the forward and overhead valves without filters would bring the time down to 90 seconds. For most of the Apollo EVAs, one or the other of the valves was used; although, for the equipment jettison they will do after the EVA, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1141028" target="alsj">114:10:28</a> Neil and Buzz will use both valves. Because of the relatively large surface area of the hatch, it cannot be opened at cabin pressures much above 0.1 psia.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|We didn't really want to go and open the overhead hatch (means the overhead dump valve). We like to open only one of them, and leave the other one the way it's been.
1085622|ALSJ||Comm Break
1085622|ALSJ||Buzz is on the right side of the cabin, leaning down to open the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="alsj">hatch</a> which is hinged below his position. As it opens, it will swing inward and toward him, blocking off his position at about knee height. They have so little room that Buzz's helmet is scraping against Neil's chest-mounted Remote Control Unit.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|He's wondering if I need some light, and I'm saying I was sure it was unlocked. It just wasn't coming open.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|I recall that we thought we could pull it open against a little bit of pressure. And it turned out it took very little pressure to hold that thing closed to where we couldn't unseat it.
1085622|ALSJ||The lock lever is a very simple mechanism, with a short latching end and a longer handle pointed toward Buzz's side of the spacecraft. Thomas Schwagmeier has provided a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/hatch_handle.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled photo detail</a>. The latching decal reads, Latch Operation: 1.Insert handle in end of shaft; 2. To lock - push on handle and rotate CW (clockwise) to stop; 3. To unlock - push on handle and rotate CCW (counter clockwise) to stop. In emergency - if latch is jammed in locked position - To open hatch pull lanyard to remove lock pin, rotate cam plate out of way of latch and open hatch.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|I think it went all the way through and there was a lever on the outside, too.
1085622|ALSJ||On Apollo 12, Al Bean grabbed one of the corners of the hatch and peeled it back enough to let some oxygen out.
1085622|ALSJ||They could open the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> in the overhead rendezvous hatch to speed depressurization. Neil and Buzz will use the overhead valve when they do the equipment jettison at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1141028" target="alsj">114:10:28</a>. Otherwise, the only other time it was used was on Apollos 16 and 17. Because of his height, Cernan found it easier to reach up for the overhead valve than to reach down for the forward valve.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|My recollection is - and it may be imperfect - that there was a filter just on the one valve (meaning the dump valve on the forward hatch). (True)
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think you'd want to put a filter on the top one, 'cause that's liable to come loose and get in the way with the docking and all that stuff.
1085622|ALSJ||As for Buzz's concern about tugging on the handle, pre-flight tests had indicated that the handle would break before the hatch would deform - at 180 pounds of force versus 240 pounds. At 0.25 psi of cabin pressure, opening the hatch took 78 pounds of force versus 118 pounds at 0.35 psi. Pre-flight tests indicated that it was all but impossible to exert more than about 100 pounds when opening the hatch in an inflated suit.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|When the hatch was finally opened, it took an initial tug on it, and it appeared to bend. The whole hatch, as it opened on the far side, came toward me. As soon as it broke the seal, it appeared as though I could see some small particles rushing out.
1085622|ALSJ||Several of the crews noticed that ice crystals formed as the moist cabin air rushed out into the lunar vacuum. On one of the Apollo 17 hatch openings, the outflow even carried out a lost piece of bread.
1085622|ALSJ||With the valve in the Auto position, it can be opened from the outside in the event that the hatch closes and there is a pressure build up.
1085622|ALSJ||That is, the PLSS water flag. Evidently, they have turned on their PLSS feedwater diverter valves and, shortly, will begin to get cooling via the sublimator.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|Once the water window did clear, it seemed that the cooling was noticeable almost immediately.
1085622|ALSJ||Mike is going to turn on a fan inside one of the CSM's tanks of liquid hydrogen in order to stir the contents and prevent radial stratification due to heat loss from the wall. It was a short circuit in a similar fan in one of the oxygen tanks that caused the Apollo 13 accident.
1085622|ALSJ||Evidently, Neil's feedwater flag has not yet cleared. On all of the missions it took several minutes for the sublimators to start working.
1085622|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien tells us that the ECS caution light comes on in any of four circumstances: (1) a glycol pump failure; (2) CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure greater than 7.6 mm of mercury; (3) water separator failure; or (4) suit fan #1 failure. When the cabin is depressurized, the water separators shutdown, which is why the ECS caution light has illuminated.
1085622|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien writes "The Caution-and-Warning System could be very touchy. Since unintended alarms were known to occur, it was often easier to simply document circumstances when they occurred, rather than take the time and money to find engineering solutions. The ASC PRESS would normally come on if the pressure in the Ascent Helium tanks or in the propellant lines were below certain thresholds. Likewise, the PREAMP light would go on if the power supply for the RCS was out of tolerance. Clearly, illumination of these two lights were unintended in the context of EVA preparations but were unintended consequences of the Caution-and-Warning System design" During Apollo, NASA developed what is called Sneak Circuit Analysis ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/SneakCircuitAnalysisHandbook.pdf" target="alsj">4 Mb PDF</a> ) to deal with such situations.
1085622|ALSJ||I asked about the problem of moving around in the cabin with both of them wearing pressurized suits. The accompanying <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LMSimulator.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photo</a> by Stacey O'Brien shows her husband, Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien, standing next to a LM simulator on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|My impression was that it was pretty tight. I think that, in our training inside both the LMS ( <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7112Simulators.html" target="alsj">Lunar Module Simulator</a>) and also that other trainer we had (which Buzz called 'the EVA trainer'), we were usually dressed in street clothes and we had lots of room. And when we first did simulations with suits in there, we found out that the suits took up an awful lot of the space and things were much more cumbersome. It was much more difficult to operate in suits than we had come to expect in shirtsleeves. And, of course, when the suit is pressurized, it's that much worse. Suits filled up a lot of that LM cabin volume."
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|We put the anti-fog (wipe) on (the inside of the clear bubble helmet) as soon as we got the kit out, instead of waiting until a little bit later. I think that maybe there were two things that brought that about. One was that we weren't really sure it was going to appear later in the checklist, and we wanted to make sure we did that. The other was, in training, we wanted to avoid as many activities as we could with the PLSS on our back, because it was very uncomfortable doing any additional exercise in one g. We did find, however, that it was quite comfortable, even without the shoulder pads, to have the PLSS mounted on your back. The mass of it was not objectionable. It did require moving around methodically and very slowly to avoid banging into things - no getting around it. You just couldn't always tell what the back of the PLSS or the OPS might be in contact with at any particular time.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|As was reported, we broke one circuit breaker with the PLSS and we depressed two others, one on each side, sometime during the operation with the PLSS on the back. So that's an area that we still need to improve on to be able to have confidence that the integrity of the LM itself won't be jeopardized by the operation with the PLSS on the back.
1085622|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that Buzz brought the broken circuit breaker back to Earth.
1085622|ALSJ||I asked if they did any <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a> for the egress with pressurized suits.
1085622|ALSJ|LMP|I think that, eventually, we did; but not very much.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|This is one area of flight preparation that was never completely performed on the ground. In the (vacuum test) chamber, the PLSSs were left on the engine cover and we never put them on our backs because of their weight, and the possibility of jeopardizing the integrity of the LM. So the comm was operated, and the (hose) connections were made, but the depressurization sequence with the PLSSs on our backs was never completed. The times when we actually operated the PLSS was done always in the chamber and never done with the LM systems operable.
1085622|ALSJ||So two things were new to us. One was that it took a very long time to depressurize the LM through the bacteria filter with the PLSS adding gases to the cockpit environment and the water boiler (the sublimator) operation or something adding some cabin pressure. The second was that we weren't familiar with how long it would take to start a sublimator in this condition. It seemed to take a very long time to get through this sequence of getting the cabin pressure down to the point where we could open the hatch, getting the water turned on in the PLSS, getting the ice cake to form in the sublimator, and getting the water alarm flag to clear so that we could continue. It seemed like it took us about a half hour to get through this depressurization sequence.
1085622|ALSJ||If, as can be inferred from the air-to-ground, Neil and Buzz did wait until the hatch was open before they turned the feedwater diverter valve, then the only gases the PLSSs were adding to the cabin came from slight leakage of oxygen from the suits, which was expected. If so, Neil's speculation that the "water boiler" slowed depressurization is incorrect.
1085622|ALSJ||It has been almost 20 minutes since Buzz opened the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> for the final depressurization. For the first Apollo 12 EVA, the same sequence of events took only 8 minutes, primarily because Pete and Al went after the hatch as soon as the cabin pressure was under 0.2 psi. In detail, Pete and Al had the hatch open 3 minutes after starting the final depressurization, where as Neil and Buzz took roughly 11 minutes.
1085622|ALSJ|CDR|(The Depressurization sequence) was one that we had never duplicated on the ground. Well, in retrospect, it all seemed to work okay, it was just that we weren't used to spending all that time standing around waiting.
1091555|ALSJ||During a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PostFlightPressConf.html" target="alsj">post-mission press conference</a>, Neil referred to the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC) as a "Brooklyn clothesline". In a 2004 e-mail, he referred to it as the "Irish Washerwoman" and wrote, "The LEC idea came from the clotheslines on pulleys outside the windows of New York apartments." The LEC is a long nylon strap with a hook at each end so that it could be formed into a continuous loop. The strap ran around a pulley attached to a fitting in the cabin ceiling and out through the hatch to the Commander on the surface. Equipment could be attached to the hooks for transport between the cabin and the surface.
1091555|ALSJ||A 1939 <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11clothesline.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photograph</a> by Sid Grossman - from the collection of the Museum of the City of New York - shows clotheslines in Harlem, NYC. Although such clotheslines were not unique to Brooklyn nor to New York, they were usually associated with poorer, immigrant neighborhoods and, because New York had a large immigrant population from the start of the great Irish migration of the 1840s onward, clotheslines strung between buildings was often thought of as a characteristic of the city.
1091555|ALSJ||A detailed discussion of the LEC with photographs is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-lec.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1091555|ALSJ||Here, they are attaching the snap hook on Neil's neckring tiedown strap to the LEC. A complete discussion is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11tether.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1091612|ALSJ||According to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11lsp40.jpg" title="document page" target="alsj">page 40</a> in the Final Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, Neil will "Move through hatch (with LEC tethered)" while Buzz will "Play out LEC and use as safety tether". Later (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11lsp41.jpg" title="document page" target="alsj">page 41</a>), when Neil starts his period of Environmental Familiarization, he will "Detach and temporarily stow LEC on gear strut or ladder".
1091612|ALSJ||This may be a further LEC reference.
1091634|ALSJ||Neil is about to start the intricate process of getting down on his knees, with his back to Buzz, and then maneuver his feet toward the hatch and get himself in position to get out through the hatch.
1091634|ALSJ||The small area available to the crew at the front of the cabin is best illustrated by images taken during final Apollo 16 (LM 11, Orion) and Apollo 17 (LM 12, Challenger) LM close-out on the pad at the Cape prior to launch.
1091634|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM11-co42.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">view from above</a> shows the LMP's PLSS (without the OPS) and two helmet bags (containing the LEVAs) filling the space. As detailed on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM04_Lunar_Module_ppLV1-17.pdf" target="alsj">pages LV-4 and 5</a> in the Lunar Module News Reference, the useable floor area measures about 55 inches (140 cm) from side to side and about 36 inches (91 cm) from the hatch to the base of the 18-inch (46 cm) 'midstep' behind the crew stations. Note that the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/Apollo_PLSS_Dimensions.jpg" target="alsj">PLSS dimensions</a> are about 26 inches (66 cm) long, 19 inches (48 cm) wide, 9.5 (24 cm) inches thick at the base, and 8.75 (22 cm) inches thick at the top. The photographer was standing on the midstep, with its edge near the bottom of the frame.
1091634|ALSJ||An <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM11-co43.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Apollo 16 frame</a> taken through the open hatch shows a member of the close-out team standing on tiptoes on the midstep, with the ECS on his right and stowed items behind the Commander's station on his left. A similar <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/LM12-co29.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Apollo 17 frame</a> shows a member of the close-out team sitting on the Ascent Engine cover. Finally, an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM11-co3.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Apollo 16 frame</a> shows the top of the engine cover with Velcro strips and cloth straps where the LM crew secured the helmet bags after re-installing the drogue and probe in preparation for undocking from the CSM.
1091649|ALSJ|CMP|Eagle. The Flight Director during the EVA was Clifford E. Charlesworth.
1091649|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="alsj">purse</a> is a temporary stowage bag hanging at the front of the cabin below Panel 5 to the left of the hatch. In order to get out, Neil has turned to face the left rear of the cabin and, primarily with his hands, has lowered himself as he got his feet out through the hatch far enough that he could kneel on the cabin floor. After getting to his knees and getting centered in the hatch, he inches himself backwards, using Buzz's guidance to get his backpack under the DSKY (Display and Keyboard) panel over the hatch. He has to be careful to avoid bumping his head on the midstep and scratching his visor.
1091729|ALSJ|CDR|I guess the most important thing here with respect to the egress through the hatch and the work on the ladder and the platform (porch) is that our simulation work in both the tank and in the (one-sixth-g) airplane was a reasonably accurate simulation. They were adequate to learn to do the job and we didn't have any big surprises in that area. The things that we'd learned about body positioning, arching the back, clearances required, and one person helping another and so on worked just like the real case. There weren't any difficulties in movement through the hatch or with stability on the porch.

1091729|ALSJ||For details of what is being discussed here, see discussions at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.evaprep.html#1083648" target="alsj">108:36:48</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.evaprep.html#1084551" target="alsj">108:45:51</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.evaprep.html#1085622" target="alsj">108:56:22</a>.<br> In Summary: Houston gets a modest amount of telemetry from the PLSS, including electrocardiogram readouts, suit pressure, carbon dioxide partial pressure, battery voltage and current, oxygen bottle pressure, temperatures at the inlet to the Liquid Cooled Garment (LCG) and the outlet to the PLSS sublimator, and a temperature difference between the LCG inlet and outlet. Houston does not have a direct indication of the status of the vent window - which shows a "P" warning when the oxygen flow is below about 5 cubic feet per minute.The PLSS pump circulates water through a network of thin tubes woven into the Liquid Cooled Garment or LCG. This is a closed-loop water supply which carries excess body heat to the sublimator where the heat is transferred to a supply of feedwater which is subsequently evaporated to provide overall cooling.The sublimator consists of a sandwich of honeycomb plates on which, when exposed to vacuum, the feedwater turns to ice and it is the sublimation of the ice layer that provides cooling.
1091729|ALSJ|CDR|I'm right in position (on the porch) and now I'm going to have to go back, in a check, maybe, of just clearance going through the hatch. That's what I think it is.
1091729|ALSJ|CDR|After getting onto the porch, I came back into the LM and went up around the Z-27 corner, made sure that was as expected, and it was.
1091729|ALSJ||Neil statement that he 'went up around the Z-27 corner' is probably a reference his head high enough to clear the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LMRHSCutAway.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus Z-27 bulkhead</a> that separates the front the cabin from the back, just in front of the ascent engine cover. Once he does that, he can get to his knees and stand. The plus Z-27 bulkhead is also the front face of what is called the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">Midstep</a>.
1091729|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Riley suggests that Buzz's third sentence is "It's a little close on the one side."
1091729|ALSJ||Neil is taking a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> which contains empty food bags and other things they no longer need and don't want to have to use fuel to take back to orbit. After getting the jettison bag from Buzz, he drops it to the surface and later, will push it under the descent stage to get it out of the way.
1091729|ALSJ||Flight is reminding the Capcom, Bruce McCandless, to call the LOS (loss-of-signal) of the CSM "Columbia". This is to alert the other controllers. McCandless makes the call at 109:21:07.
1091729|ALSJ||To prepare for his own exit, Buzz has probably closed the hatch partially so that he can move over to the other side of the spacecraft and then open the hatch fully to get it out of the way. At 109:19:48 Neil is probably asking Buzz if he is being hindered by the LEC.
1092055|ALSJ||Neil is pulling the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mesa-deploy.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">D-ring</a> which releases the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11quads.jpg" title="mage" target="alsj">MESA</a>, attached to the side of the LM under Buzz's station, and lets it swing down into an accessible position. Once down on the surface, he can adjust the MESA height if necessary. Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-31080.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-31080</a> (scan by Paolo Dangelo) shows Neil working at the MESA. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">drawing of the MESA</a> shows the location of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> which will show Neil's climb down the ladder.
1092055|ALSJ||The CSM "Columbia" has slipped behind the Moon and out of radio contact.
1092055|ALSJ||The circuit breakers are push-pull buttons. To activate the TV, Buzz will push the TV circuit breaker 'in'. This is also called putting the circuit breaker in the "closed' position, as opposed to pulling it out to the 'open' position.
1092055|ALSJ||There are numerous examples of Bruce beginning his transmissions with "This is Houston." He has to 'key' his microphone to transmit and, in this case, may not have gotten it turned on until after he had said "This is".
1092055|ALSJ||Flight wants to be sure the TV camera is ready so they can monitor Neil's climb down the LM ladder. At 109:21:22, McCandless told Buzz they were "standing by for your TV," but didn't specifically mention the circuit breaker, probably hoping that Buzz would take the hint.
1092206|ALSJ||Mark Gray, Spacecraft Films, uploaded the restored video to YouTube in four part in April 2013. Part 1 starts here and is shown alongside the synched 16-mm film
1092209|ALSJ||As discussed below, only the feed from <a href="http://honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/goldstone/index.html" target="alsj">Goldstone</a>, which is what was being viewed in Houston and by television viewers outside Australia, is "upside down" during this first segment. The Goddard recording of the HSK feed linked above is properly oriented.
1092209|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to make sure the picture was adequate so that we didn't have to take the time to unpack that (S-band) antenna and unfold it. It was pretty good size. I'd say it's maybe eight feet across.
1092209|ALSJ|CDR|
1092209|ALSJ||Bill Wood calls attention to the following material from <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch13-4.html" target="alsj">Chariots for Apollo</a> by Courtney G Brooks, James M. Grimwood, Lloyd S. Swenson: "One item of worldwide public impact - television - raised no issues whatsoever on this flight. Slayton even urged the need for some kind of erectable antenna. The crewmen could not, after all, be expected to wait patiently in the lander until the earth moved Goldstone, California, and its 64-meter radar dish into line with the spacecraft - before they climbed out onto the surface. There was also some question whether the Goldstone facility would be available, since it was needed for a Mariner flyby of Mars in July. At a management council meeting in March, the prospect of doing without the big California dish, as well as a similar one at Parkes, Australia, forced agreement on a contingency plan for a portable antenna. Eventually, both Goldstone and Parkes were free to cover Apollo 11, but proper alignment with Goldstone was still a problem. Low decided to delay the lunar module's descent by one revolution to make sure 'that we will have Goldstone coverage.' If the launch was delayed and if Parkes was better situated to pick up the signals, the relay would travel from the lunar module to Parkes, to Sydney by microwave, across the Pacific Ocean via synchronous satellite Intelsat III, to the control center in Houston, to the television networks, and thence to television sets throughout most of the world. Goldstone would shorten that route."
1092209|ALSJ||Some Apollo managers were worrying about the quality of the pictures they could expect. Looking at a photograph of a simulation, Phillips observed to Low that the first step onto the lunar surface might be in the shadows. And the light might be too bright in the stowage area, as the astronauts unloaded the experiments package. Phillips asked Low to see about this, since 'sharing with the world our historical first steps onto the moon warrants our efforts to maximize this return.' Low did not believe the results would be as bad as Phillips feared, but Houston set up scale models under various lighting conditions to make sure of good coverage of the crewman as he descended to the lunar surface. Before he left Houston, <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/PaulHaney.html" target="alsj">Paul Haney</a> had suggested that the surface camera be set up to photograph the liftoff from the moon. The idea was exciting, but it was too late to arrange it for Apollo 11. It would have to wait for a future mission."
1092209|ALSJ||Returning to the 1991 mission review, I then asked Neil about the relative priority of the TV.
1092209|ALSJ|CDR|I was fully prepared to deploy the antenna, and I practiced with it a bunch of times so I wouldn't call it low priority. But we were glad that we didn't have to take the time to do that.
1092209|ALSJ||The reason that the picture is upside down is that the camera was mounted upside down on the MESA (as can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVCameraMESA.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">training image</a>). Each of the tracking stations had the capability of inverting the image so it would look normal. This was done by throwing a switch from the 'normal' position - used when the camera was on its tripod away from the LM and was, therefore, rightside up - to the 'inverted' position - used when the camera was upside down on the MESA. As John Sarkissian relates below, the Goldstone switch hadn't been set to 'inverted'. The HSK feed linked above is correctly oriented because the HSK switch was in the proper position.
1092209|ALSJ||Flight expects an answer to come from FAO. McCandless passes the answer to Buzz at 109:23:25
1092234|ALSJ||The story of the Apollo 11 TV signal is well told in Hamish Lindsay's excellent book, </i>Tracking Apollo to the Moon<i>. See, also, accounts of the contributions made by NASA's <a href="http://www.honeysucklecreek.net" target="alsj">Honeysuckle Creek</a> receiving station and by the <a href="http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/apollo11/" target="alsj">Parkes</a> Radio Observatory, Australia, compiled by Colin Mackellar and John Sarkissian, respectively.
1092234|ALSJ||Briefly, when Buzz closed the TV circuit breaker at 109:22 (02:54 GMT), the Moon was at an azimuth/elevation of 76/28 at Honeysuckle and 226/36 at Goldstone, so good signals were being received at both stations. As planned, the Goldstone signal was used initially. However, because the signal quality at Honeysuckle proved to be superior, a switch was made and the Honeysuckle signal was used until the moon rose high enough at Parkes that its big dish (64 meter diameter versus only 26 meters at Honeysuckle) could get a good signal. The Goldstone audio signal was used throughout the EVA.
1092234|ALSJ||The times when switching from one signal source to another can be determined by the presence of various, steady white spots present in the TV images. See the accompanying <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11WhiteSpots.html" target="alsj">discussion</a>. Note that a spot that is an unwitting part of the Goldstone signal does not appear in the restored video, not having survived the restoration process.
1092234|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVcomparisons.pdf" target="alsj">comparison of photographs</a> of the Apollo 11 Lunar Television as seen at Goldstone, Honeysuckle Creek, and Houston has been provided by Colin Mackellar.
1092234|ALSJ||Immediately after McCandless responded to Buzz at 109:22:34, the TV image switches to the proper orientation, with the Goldstone spot now above center in the pre-restoration clip.
1092234|ALSJ||John Sarkissian writes in 2003: "The toggle switch on the Honeysuckle and Goldstone scan-converters was initially set to the 'normal' position. The Parkes scan-converter - which was being operated by Dick Holl, a Bendix Field Engineering Corp. engineer who helped design the scan-converters - had his toggle switch correctly set to the 'inverted' position as the broadcast began. A few seconds after the broadcast began, Ed von Renouard at HSK (Honeysuckle Creek) realised that the picture at HSK was upside-down and quickly threw the switch on the HSK scan-converter into the correct, 'inverted' position to put the picture the right way up. Goldstone, presumably because their picture was going out live, didn't correct their switch setting until instructed to do so by Houston TV."
1092234|ALSJ||Ed von Renouard was the Honeysuckle Creek Video Technician who operated the HSK scan-converter. Both he and the HSK scan-converter were located in a room deep within the HSK complex. Dick Holl and the Parkes scan-converter were at the OTC (Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission) Paddington terminal located on Oxford Street, Paddington (Sydney).
1092234|ALSJ||Those listening to the audio track may have noticed a high-pitched beep at the start and end of each of Bruce's transmissions. Markus Mehring and Bill Wood have provided a discussion of these <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/quindar.html" target="alsj">Quindar Tones</a>.
1092310|ALSJ||Neil jumps down to the footpad again, keeping a two-handed grip on the ladder as he does so. There is no motion of the 16-mm camera evident when he lands on the footpad.
1092310|ALSJ||The interior of each of the primary struts contains a piston and a compressible honeycomb structure, as shown in the accompanying <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11lm5strut.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">diagram</a>. As indicated in the diagram and drawing of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11landinggear.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">landing gear</a>, full compression of the honeycomb structure in a hard landing would have shortened the primary strut by 32 inches ( 81 cm). Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that, as can be seen on pages 81, 119, and others in Scott Sullivan's </i>Virtual LM<i>, the bottom of the ladder was attached to the primary strut just above the point where the lower part of the strut could slide into the upper part. Consequently, full compression of the primary strut would have left the bottom rung of the ladder just above the footpad. However, there was never any significant compression ( "stroking" ) of any of the struts in any of the landings, so the astronauts had to contend with a jump of slightly more than 32 inches. Fortunately, one-sixth gravity made it relatively easy. All you needed to do was give a little push with the legs and, with your hands on the outside rail, guide yourself up.
1092310|ALSJ|CDR|The work and effort required to go up and down the ladder and in through the hatch are not objectionable enough that they need to be worried about. Going up the ladder and going through the hatch are not high-workload items. They are items that require some caution and practice...there weren't any temperature effects noted in the egress or ladder. Nothing felt hot or cold or had any temperature effects at all that I was aware of.
1092325|ALSJ||The ladder is mounted on the west strut and is, therefore, in the LM's shadow. The recorded image is fairly dark. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes that, as a result of the information from Bruce, Buzz changes settings on the DAC and the recorded scene brightens, "just in time to catch Neil and his historic step off the footpad."
1092325|ALSJ||At the time we hear Neil say 'only depressed' in the following, NASA switches to the Honeysuckle Creek TV signal. The Goldstone spot disappears in the pre-restoration video.
1092338|ALSJ||Just before Neil's next transmission, as a result of Buzz's changes to the 16-mm camera settings and Neil's position on the footpad, the film record shows the LEC attached to the front of Neil's suit. We can see reflections in the LMP's window of what appear to be parts of Buzz's suit as he changes the camera settings and monitors Neil's activities. Ken Glover has grabbed a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11neiltether01.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film.
1092414|ALSJ||Neil has his right hand on the ladder and will step down with his left foot, leaving his right foot on the footpad. As he reaches down with his foot, the 16-mm film indicates that there isn't much slack in the LEC. (See a full discussion linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11tether.html" target="alsj">here</a>. ) In the TV record, the LEC is just barely visible against the black sky.
1092414|ALSJ||The audio clip provided by John Stoll for the preceeding section regretably ends with "for (a) man" and the next clip begins with "one giant leap". Ken Glover has merged the two clips. Listeners will hear a slight change in the audio across this artificial gap. There are many other audio recordings of this historic moment that are continuous during this segment, including the audio on the video clip.
1092418|ALSJ||At the time of the mission, the world heard Neil say "That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind". As Andrew Chaikin details in </i>A Man on the Moon<i>, after the mission, Neil said that he had intended to say 'one small step for a man' and believed that he had done so. However, he also agreed that the 'a' didn't seem to be audible in the recordings. The important point is that the world had no problem understanding his meaning. However, over the decades, people interested in details of the mission - including your editor - have listened repeatedly to the recordings, without hearing any convincing evidence of the 'a'. In 2006, with a great deal of attendant media attention, journalist/ entrepreneur Peter Shann Ford claimed to have located the 'a' in the waveform of Neil's transmission. Subsequently, more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and, most importantly, audio spectrograms. None of these analyses support Ford's conclusion. The transcription used above honors Neil's intent.
1092418|ALSJ||The raw NASA transcript give the start of this transmission as 109:24:48, which is clearly inconsistent with what has gone before. The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives "initial contact" as 109:24:15 or 02:56:15 GMT/UTC on 21 July 1969. Later in the mission, NASA tells the press that the first step came at 109:24:20. An examination of the restored video indicates that, to the extent that the audio and video tracks are properly synched, Neil puts his left foot firmly on the surface five seconds after the start of his transmission "I'm going to step off the LM now." and six seconds before he starts to say "That's one small step." In June 2011, Journal Contributor Heiko K&uuml;ffen used the audio track that accompanies the restored video to revise times between 109:20:56 and 109:27:29. Except for the time of "That's one small step" and the transmission that follows - "Yes, the surface is fine and powdery" - there are no differences greater than 2 seconds between Heiko's analysis and the times then given in the ALSJ. I have repeated Heiko's analysis and confirm his results to within 2 seconds. In particular, Heiko gets 109:24:14 for "I'm going to step off the LM now." and I get 109:24:12. The difference is unimportant when compared with other uncertainties. My analysis is based on the time of hatch opening (given as 109:07:33 in the Mission report), which seems to be relatively certain.
1092418|ALSJ||Based on the times of transmissions prior to 109:24:12, Neil started to say "I'm going to step" at 109:24:12, stepped firmly on the surface at 109:24:17, and started "That's one small step" at 109:24:23. Readers interested in the exact timing of events in these transcripts should note that there are notable inconsistencies in the times given in the original NASA transcripts. Clearly, over longer intervals, times in the original transcripts are only suggestive. Discontinuous jumps in the original transcripts occur at notable mission events and elsewhere, probably at the end of tapes or tape segments used by individual transcribers. Over intervals of several minutes, the best audio clips can be used to get relative accuracies of 2-3 seconds.
1092418|ALSJ||After examining the soil disturbance around his left boot, Neil moves his right hand lower on the ladder and steps down with his right foot.
1092508|ALSJ||In discussions about this paragraph, Andrew Chaikin suggested the transcription above for the first sentence. This replaced my original transcription, which was "(Garbled) the surface is fine and powdery."
1092508|ALSJ||At the end of this transmission, Neil lets go of the ladder for the first time.
1092508|ALSJ||Neil turns to his right and faces the spacecraft, we get a reasonable view of the LEC against the bright lunar surface in the background, as shown in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11NeiltetherTV.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">TV frames</a> captured by Andrew Chaikin.
1092508|ALSJ||Neil gets both hands on parts of the spacecraft and appears to do some slight knee bends. Next, he lets go of the LM and backs away; but stays close.
1092545|ALSJ||During this brief pause, Neil appears to take the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-lec.html" target="alsj">LEC</a> off the snap hook.
1092616|ALSJ||In 1968, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/SurveyorResultsP151-64.pdf" target="alsj">soil mechanics data</a> from the five successful Surveyor missions was used to model cratering that might be expected from the descent engine exhaust plume. As mentioned on page 125 in the <a href="AP11_LSOPsPlan.pdf" target="alsj">Final Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Operations Plan</a>, the modeling indicated that "anticipated lunar soil erosion resulting from LM DPS (exhaust) impingement on the lunar surface will not begin until the LM is about 10 feet above the lunar surface and that it will not be extensive." Page 44 in the Ops Plan indicates that, while Neil waited for Buzz to join him on the surface, he would look for DPS effects on the surface: (1) Crater and (2) Radial Erosion.
1092616|ALSJ||John Saxon, Operations Manager at Honeysuckle Creek (HSK) during Apollo, has provided an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11HSK1092635.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">image</a> taken off the monitor at Honeysuckle Creek at about 109:26:35. Saxon writes in May 2003, "I've scanned the attached at 300 dpi, resized/resampled to slightly smaller and saved jpg at min (100 percent quality) compression - other than that I have not attempted to clean up or sharpen, etc."
1092616|ALSJ||Saxon and Journal Contributor Colin Mackellar have provided a collection of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11HSKMonitorStills.html" target="alsj">17 images taken off the HSK monitor</a>. The images are of much higher quality than what was seen by the global television audience.
1092616|ALSJ||Just before Neil's next transmission, NASA switches to the Goldstone signal. The image is negative in the original recordings. In the prerestoration clip, the Goldstone spot is rather faint, at about the same distance below the top of the frame as the second ladder rung from the top.
1092654|ALSJ||The camera is in the ETB which, in turn, is hooked to the LEC. Both Neil and Buzz have a checklist sewn to the upper part of the left glove that covered the wrist area. Neil's is shown in NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38898HR.jpg" target="alsj">S69-38898</a> and Buzz's in shown in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38937HR.jpg" target="alsj">S69-38937</a>. The camera transfer is the first item on Neil's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj"> checklist</a>.
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|I remember that we devised, during the training program, the LEC and the camera mount. There may have been others, but those are the two that I recall. The camera mount was something I suggested. I recall that. It was a bracket that went on the front of the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> to hold the Hasselblads. It had always been intended that we just, you know, carry a camera like you normally carry a camera, maybe with a strap."
1092654|ALSJ|LMP|With the bracket, one could conceivably take the camera down that way, rather than in the transfer bag.
1092654|ALSJ||I noted that it probably would have been impossible to get through the hatch wearing a camera. All of the crews chose to send their cameras out in the Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB).
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|That would have been tight. I don't know.
1092654|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes that the hatch is 32 inches square. Excluding the OPS, the PLSS is about 26 inches tall and 9.5 inches deep at its base. Neil's photo of Buzz saluting the flag, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5874HR.jpg" target="alsj">5874</a>, allows us to estimate that the distance from the back of the PLSS to the front of the RCU is about 26 inches. When mounted on the RCU bracket, the camera adds another 8 inches, giving a total of 34 inches, 2 inches more than the size of the hatch opening.
1092654|ALSJ||Returning to the missions review, I then asked Neil and Buzz about the pre-flight decision to take only one <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html" target="alsj">Hasselblad</a> camera out on the EVA.
1092654|ALSJ|LMP|Pretty cheap tourists.
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|We had two (in the cabin), but we just used one (outside).
1092654|ALSJ|LMP|We left one on the surface, because I remember the gnashing of teeth about leaving a valuable Hasselblad on the surface. And that was to save weight.
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|My recollection is that we had something - and I was thinking it was a camera, but maybe it was just a film pack - that we could go back up to get if we needed. We didn't plan to, but if we had an emergency, we could go back up the ladder and retrieve this other.
1092654|ALSJ||See the discussion following <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1093943" target="alsj">109:39:43</a>.
1092654|ALSJ||Because the IVA camera was heat-sensitive, it could only be used in shadow. If the astronaut carrying it wanted to use it outside the LM shadow, he would have to be sure to keep his own shadow on the camera - an awkward situation - and could not have taken either up-Sun or cross-Sun photos. The fact that the IVA camera had no <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-reseau.html" target="alsj">reseau plate</a> would have meant that photogrammetry would not have been possible at all and that there would have been no means of checking the negatives for physical distortion during processing or storage."
1092654|ALSJ||The Apollo Hasselblads were very durable - as a result of the flight-rating process - but I don't think that the black exterior of the IVA camera would have withstood prolonged, direct exposure to sunlight in a vacuum. The IVA camera would have been of only marginal use as an EVA back-up. Considering this, I think it was an extremely risky decision to fly just one EVA Hasselblad. We know that one of the Apollo 12 EVA cameras became unusable during the second EVA and, to a lesser extent, camera problems were also experienced on Apollos 15 and 17. Therefore, hindsight suggests that the decision to fly only one EVA camera meant that there was actually a non-negligible chance of having only partial documentation of the first lunar EVA.
1092654|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html" target="alsj">lunar surface Hasselblad</a> was equipped with a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../Biogon5.6_60mm_ZEISS.pdf" target="alsj">60-mm Zeiss Biogon lens</a> while the IVA Hasselblad had an 80-mm Zeiss Planar lens.
1092654|ALSJ||Mehring - "If you have a look at the photographs that Neil and Buzz took out the LM windows during the mission and, also, the pictures they took inside the LM (such as AS11-37- <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5528HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5528</a>), you'll notice that quite a number of them do not have reseau crosses in them. These were taken with the black, IVA camera. Only the cameras designed for EVAs - the silver ones - had a reseau plate, simply because the need to make photogrammetric measurements only existed for surface photographs. You can use this as an ID helper for 70mm photographs throughout the rest of the missions: if a picture has reseau crosses, it's from a silver EVA-Hasselblad; if it hasn't, it's from a black IVA-cam. Note that this is not related to magazines, since the magazines fit on either body, A particular magazine could contain both photos with and photos without reseau crosses if the magazine was used on two cameras."
1092654|ALSJ||Finally, on a cultural note, the black color of the Hasselblads made for NASA was the primary reason why 'black' suddenly became a favored 'professional look', hence almost every commercially available camera was released in black during the subsequent decades. Only recently have the companies begun to be a more creative, producing cameras with metal exteriors of different kinds, and colorful plastics. This is probably one of the lesser known results of the early manned US-spaceflight program!
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|It is very easy to see in the shadows after you adapt for a little while. When you first come down the ladder, you're in the shadow. You can see everything perfectly; the LM and things on the ground. When you walk out into the sunlight and then back into the shadow, it takes a while to adapt."
1092654|ALSJ|LMP|In the first part of the shadow, when you first move from the sunlight into the shadow, when the Sun is still shining on the helmet as you traverse cross-Sun, you've got this reflection in your face. At this point, it's just about impossible to see anything in the shadow. As soon as you get your helmet into the shadow, you can begin to perceive things and to go through a dark-adaptation process. Continually moving back and forth from sunlight into shadow should be avoided, because it's going to cost you some time in perception ability.
1092654|ALSJ||At about 109:27:45, NASA switches to the Honeysuckle signal. The Goldstone spot disappears in the pre-restoration video.
1092654|ALSJ||The flight plan and checklists indicate that Neil would collect the contingency sample before getting the Hasselblad camera down from the LM. Instead, he appears to be bringing the camera down first. Neil should have collected a sample of lunar soil, shortly after stepping onto the lunar surface, and placed it in his leg pocket in case there was an emergency departure. In this way, geologists would be guaranteed at least a small sample of lunar soil. The controllers are debating whether to wait for Neil to finish his current task or to remind him immediately of the contingency sample. Since everything is going well, they wait.
1092654|ALSJ|LMP|The initial LEC operation of lowering the camera seemed to work fairly well. It appeared as though you might have been pulling on the wrong strap at first; however, we rectified that without any particular trouble.
1092654|ALSJ|CDR|Initially, I had a bit of difficulty. I was not trying to get the camera up or down at that point; I was trying to pull the slack out of the line and make both straps taut. For some reason or other, it was hung up, and I had some difficulty getting the slack out of the lines. Once having done that, it came down fairly nicely.
1092654|ALSJ||Neil brings the camera down holding the LEC loosely in his left hand and pulling the strap with his right hand in the appropriate direction to bring the camera out.
1092654|ALSJ||The 16mm film ends at about the mid-point of Neil's next transmission. Just before Buzz switches the 16mm camera off to change magazines and film speed, in the 16mm record we can see the orange decals on the top of the body and film magazine of Neil's Hasselblad
1092654|ALSJ||That is, there is enough sunlight reflecting off the lunar surface onto the LM that Neil can see the shadowed LM surfaces. They will be a bit harder to see clearly once he steps out into the direct sun. These are the "lighting" comments called out on Neil's cuff <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38898.jpg" target="alsj">checklist</a>.
1092654|ALSJ||About six minutes into the 'Apollo 11 Moonwalk Part 1 of 4' clip, we start to see that there are two items coming down to Neil on the LEC. Paul Fjeld suggests that the first is the inner bag the LEC was stowed in. The second is the Hasselblad.
1092654|ALSJ||Just before Buzz's next transmission, NASA switches back to the Goldstone TV signal. The Goldstone spot reappears in the pre-restoration video.
1092654|ALSJ||Comm Break
1092654|ALSJ||Flight is concerned that Neil has still not collected the contingency sample. Neil starts working on the contingency sample at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1093330" target="alsj">109:33:30</a>.
1092654|ALSJ||Flight is polling the controllers, checking that all is OK.
1092654|ALSJ||NASA switches to the superior Parkes TV signal. John Sarkissian has examined the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_on_eagles_wings.pdf" target="alsj">available recordings</a> and has determined that, after using the Parkes signal for about 5 seconds, NASA switched back to the Goldstone signal for a 2-second confirmation of the relative quality and then used the Parkes signal, together with audio via Goldstone, for the rest of the EVA. In the restored video, a white spot unwittingly introduced into the signal at Parkes can be seen in the horizontal LM strut on the left. The pre-restoration clip was made from a cropped version of the original video and the Parkes spot is outside the retained area.
1092654|ALSJ||McCandless has seen Neil move and thinks he is about to start the contingency sample.
1093053|ALSJ||Flight insists that Capcom remind Neil about the contingency sample.
1093053|ALSJ||Note that the contingency sample is not indicated on the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38898.jpg" target="alsj">checklist</a>. This may be part of the reason for Flight's insistence.
1093053|ALSJ||Comm Break
1093053|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/tools09.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">contingency sampler</a> has a collapsible handle and, at the end, a removable bag which, after he has collected a sample of soil, Neil will put into the strap-on pocket on his leg. This sample will provide the geologists back home with at least a little of the Moon should Neil and Buzz have to suddenly terminate the EVA. The reminder from Houston, to be followed momentarily by another, is an indication that the contingency sample is a very high priority item.
1093115|ALSJ||Flight knows that Parkes is a radio telescope and therefore, no transmitter.
1093226|ALSJ|CDR|Here, we changed the flight plan somewhat and got the camera down before doing the contingency sample. I wanted to get that camera down and hooked up (on the RCU) while I was over there in the (LM) shadow, because to do the contingency sample, I was going to have to stow the LEC and go over into the area out of the shadow. Since I wanted to do it on the right side (that is, Buzz's side of the spacecraft) where the (16mm) camera was mounted (in Buzz's window), I was going to have to make a trip of about 10 or 15 feet before I started the contingency sample. That's the reason we changed the order.
1093226|ALSJ||This statement is representative of the caution and conservatism that was the hallmark of the Apollo 11 EVA. Other crews could be less conservative, building on the experiences of others. However, Neil has been outside for all of eight minutes at this point and is not ready to consider 10 or 15 feet a trivial distance.
1093226|ALSJ||Note that, when Neil said during the Tech Debrief that he "wanted to do it on the right side", he was using "right" and "left" in the sense that those words were used in the cabin, with the crew facing forward.
1093226|ALSJ||On his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38898.jpg" target="alsj">cuff checklist</a>, Neil's "first pictures" are: 'Photo 3 Gear' and 'Terrain'. As <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11flsp_p44_Photo3Gear.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detailed on page 44</a> in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11flsp.pdf" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Final Lunar Surface Procedures</a>, 'Photo 3 Gear' means getting photos of the +y (north), -y (south), and +z landing gear. Although there is no explicit mention of Neil taking a panorama at this point, he has evidently decided that a pan will take care of most of 'Terrain' objectives. Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-32240.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-32240</a> seems to show Neil practicing this part of the EVA.
1093226|ALSJ||Neil begins by adjusting the f-stop and/or focus on the Hasselblad, then takes up-Sun photo AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5850HR.jpg" target="alsj">5850</a>. He makes his first turn to his right 49 seconds after the start of the clip and then, five seconds later, sidesteps a little farther from the MESA-mounted TV camera. Neil's subsequent turns are at 1:08, 1:22, 1:32, 1:36, 1:50, 1:55, 1:59. Because this is Neil's first lunar panorama, he may be taking his time while he taking the first few frames. The interval between the first turn/step and the next turn is 14 seconds.The next two intervals are 14 and 10 seconds. With one exception, subsequent intervals between turns are 4-5 seconds, perhaps indicating that Neil has gained confidence that he can turn between frames without trouble. The exception is the 14-second interval during which Neil took 5855. As indicated on a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11MagS-2.jpg" target="alsj">decal</a> on the top of flown Magazine S, Neil planned to change the f-stop setting from 5.6 to 8 or 11 when taking down-Sun photos. In the video, it appears that, in preparation for taking 5855,&nbsp; he increases the setting at about 1:39, takes 5855 at about 1:44, and then goes back to 5.6 after 5855 at 1:45.&nbsp; Unprocessed scans are available on the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/catalog/70mm/magazine/?40" target="alsj">LPI website.</a>
1093226|ALSJ||After Neil finishes his panorama, in the TV we see him using his left hand to open the top of the pocket on his left thigh. As he does so, he moves off camera to our right and we don't see him actually remove the contingency sampler. For a view of the pocket, see training image <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-KSC-69PC-324.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">KSC-69PC-324</a>.
1093226|ALSJ||At some point after going off-camera to the right, Neil turns and takes three pictures toward the south: AS11-40-5859-61. These show the +Z (west landing gear and the terrain beyond. More detail can be found in the Image Library <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#a11pan5859-61" target="alsj">entry</a> for what amounts to a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan5859-61emj.jpg" target="alsj">mini-pan</a>.
1093325|ALSJ||Buzz has installed a new film magazine on the 16mm camera and restarts it. When the film restarts at about 109:33:32, Neil is getting the sampler configured. As can be seen in the 16-mm film, Neil is wearing a strap-on pocket on his left thigh, as is also indicated in a pre-flight <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-38889HR.jpg" target="alsj">photo</a> of his suit in its lunar-surface configuration. As he went down the ladder, Neil carried the contingency sampler in that pocket.
1093330|ALSJ||Neil and Buzz both have side-visors built into the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LEVA.html" target="alsj">LEVAs</a> and Andy Chaikin notes that, during the contingency sample collection, Neil can be seen in the 16mm coverage with his left side visor partially extended.
1093330|ALSJ||Because the Moon has no atmosphere, the surface is continually bombarded by large and small meteorites - mostly small. Each impact digs a crater and sprays ejecta around the immediate area. The net effect is that the very top layer of the soil is very soft. However, each of the impacts shakes the subsurface layers in the area around the crater, and that shaking tends to settle the subsurface layer and make it denser. Indeed, as Buzz will discover when he tries to drive a couple of core tubes into the surface at the end of the EVA, below about 4 inches, the soil is very densely packed, rather like beach sand becomes after a wave has withdrawn.
1093330|ALSJ||Neil collected a total contingency sample of 1015.29 grams, including four rocks, each weighing more than 50 grams (terrestrial). The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11ContingencySample.html" target="alsj">contingency sample</a> is discussed on a separate page.
1093456|ALSJ||In response to a question from Mick Winfield in the UK, Journal Contributor Larry Turoski writes, "Living on the west edge of the Mojave Desert, I'll bet he's referring to the area within, say 50 miles or so of Edwards AFB, where he spent a lot of time. The ground elevation around there is about 2500 feet (750 m), give or take. It you go farther north along the eastern Sierra you'll get to elevations of about 4000 feet (1200 m), then with a mighty jump, about 6000 feet (1800 m). Northeast of Edwards, you encounter Death Valley National Park, with elevations ranging from 11,049 feet (3368m) above sea level to 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. South and east of Edwards you get into the "low desert," near and below sea level in some places. The terrain over which he flew the X-15 (a line running northeast/southwest from southern Utah to Edwards( comprises portions of what we call the Basin-and-Range (geologic) province, and the southern portion of the Utah Desert, which is very high and most beautifully weathered canyons in sandstone terrain. The Basin-and-Range contains numerous alternating north-south mountain ridges and north-south valleys, one after the other along an east-west line like teeth on a saw blade. I can say that the desert near Edwards is very Tranquility Base-like, so that was probably what he meant. Take a look at the website <a href="http://www.caldrive.com" target="alsj">CalDrive</a>. This site is about driving in California and was written especially for visitors from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The author concentrates mostly on the desert and provides numerous photographs of terrain. I recommend it highly. For other pictures of the various desert features to be found in California, including Edwards AFB, I recommend you take a look at <a href="http://www.mojaveroads.com" target="alsj">Mojave Roads</a>, done by none other than yours truly. And yes, a great deal of the 'high desert' is easily accessible by ordinary car."
1093456|ALSJ||A series of Apollo 15 training photos, starting with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/images15.html#S7123771" target="alsj">S71-23771</a>, document a field trip done at the rim of the Rio Grande Gorge (elevation 2100 m where US Highway 64 crosses the river) near Taos, New Mexico. The country around Shiprock, New Mexico (elevation 1500 m on the Navajo reservation), and around Cameron, Arizona (elevation 1250 m on the eastern approaches to the Grand Canyon) are also easily accessible.
1093456|ALSJ||Kipp Teague has provided a hi-resolution <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f.1093530.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">scan</a> from the 16-mm film showing Neil approaching the LM as he removes the handle from the sampler. Note that he has his visor up. Photo AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5869HR.jpg" target="alsj">5869</a>, an image in a series Neil takes of Buzz coming down the ladder, shows the handle on the left, at about the same level as Buzz's boots. See a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5869ContingencyHandle.jpg" target="alsj">labeled detail</a>.
1093456|ALSJ||Vesicles are spherical imprints of gas bubbles that formed inside the lava as it cools and hardens. Phenocrysts are embedded crystals. In his excellent book about the Apollo missions, <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/" target="alsj">To a Rocky Moon</a>, Don Wilhelms puts both Neil and Buzz in small group of astronauts whom he remembers as having been "either especially interested in geology or competent in science in general" and who, therefore, received special attention from the geology instructors. Certainly, the ease with which Neil used the terms "vesicle" and "phenocryst" was not the norm. Later in the EVA, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html#1110001" target="alsj">111:00:01</a>, he will change his mind about the vesicles and will decide, correctly, that what he is seeing are small craters made in the rocks by small impacts. Still later, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html#1112234" target="alsj">111:22:34</a>, he will recognize and collect some genuinely vesicular basalt.
1093556|ALSJ||Neil is conducting a little soil mechanics experiment by pushing the sampler handle into the surface. The third hi-resolution <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f.1093607.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows the sampler handle sticking up out of the surface next to Neil's right leg. The alternating dark and light sections along its length appear to be related to the sections separated by the white rings visible in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../tools/judy05.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S68-54937</a>.
1093607|ALSJ||Neil has just discarded the ring from the contingency sample collection bag. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy05.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Figure 5</a> from Judy Allton's Tool Book shows Neil using the sampler during training. Figures <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy06.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">6a</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy07.gif" title="image" target="alsj">6b</a>, and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy07.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">7</a> show additional detail. After collecting the sample, Neil presses the release on the handle just above the ring, extracts the ring, detaches the bag from the ring, discards the ring, and closes the bag.
1093607|ALSJ||Immediately after Neil said "It's hard for me to bend down further than that", we see him raise his right arm, with the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11CSSring1.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">ring clearly in his hand</a>. He appears to examine the ring - probably having held it aloft to get it into sunlight - and turning it so that it happens to end up edge-on to the camera.
1093607|ALSJ||In June 2002, Andy Chaikin noted that, two or three frames later, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11CSSring2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">a single frame shows something behind Neil</a> that could be either the ring in flight or a piece of lint or something similar on the film. Although the center of the object is open, it is not regular in shape and seems more likely to be lint. In addition, after we see the ring in Neil's hand, his hand motions don't seem to be consistent with a toss back over his shoulder.
1093607|ALSJ||In 2007, Jim Scotti noted that, after Neil lowers his arm and gets his right hand in front of him at about waist height, we see him tossing the ring toward the spacecraft. Ulli Lotzmann and Ken Glover have created an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/samplerring.gif" title="four-frame animation" target="alsj">animated gif</a> showing Neil flick off the ring toward the spacecraft and capturing it in motion. The motion is consistent with a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5864CntSmplrRing.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5864" target="alsj">5864</a> showing what is almost certainly the ring lying under the descent stage.
1093607|ALSJ||Two explanations come to mind about Neil's and Buzz's amusement over "throwing things so far". Later crews had a great deal of fun throwing things in the weak lunar gravity field. It is possible that Neil and Buzz are amused that their first throw is a short toss under the spacecraft. Alternatively, things do fall much more slowly on the Moon than they do on Earth and even a casual toss like this one will send the object much farther than would have been the case on Earth. Although Neil and Buzz may well have had some experience in the cabin tossing things to each other - say a checklist - as short as this first toss was, outside the confines of the cabin the result could have been impressive. Either interpretation - or both - seem possible.
1093607|ALSJ||In 2012, Journal Contributor AwE130 located the ring in AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5505" target="alsj">5505</a>, which is a post-EVA photo Neil took out his window. AwE130 also noted that, whereas Neil was on the north side of the spacecraft then he tossed the ring, it ended up on the south side. Knowing the final position of the ring, we can estimate how far Neil threw it As shown in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11CSC_Ring_InFlight_Virtual_LM022.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">comparison</a> between 5505, the 16-mm frame that immediately follows Neil toss, and a top view of the LM from Scott Sullivan's superb book <i>Virtual LM</i>, we see from the shadows that Neil's hand as about the same distance from the E-W centerline of the LM as the inner ends of the secondary struts. Similarly, the ring ended up a bit closer to the centerline than the ends of the secondary struts. Knowing that the outer edges of opposite footpads are 9.45 meters (31 feet) apart, we can estimate that the inner ends of the secondary struts on opposite sides of the spacecraft are 5.52 meters apart and that the ring flew roughly 5.5 meters or, perhaps, a bit less.
1093607|ALSJ||In a gravity field and in the absence of significant atmospheric drag, an object dropped from a height, h, will hit the ground after a time t = sqrt(2xh/g), where g is gravitational acceleration. On Earth, g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>; and, on the Moon, g = 1.63 m/s<sup>2</sup>. In the 16-mm film, it appears that Neil releases the ring from about waist height or h = 1.2. If he had simply dropped the ring, it would have hit the ground after 0.5 seconds. Or, if he had tossed so that it's initial velocity, v, was purely horizontal, it still would have hit the ground after 0.5 seconds, but would have travelled out a distance d = v x t.
1093607|ALSJ||To get an estimate of the initial horizontal velocity, I performed a simple experiment, tossing an object of similar size to the CSC ring (a shoe polish can) from a height of 1.2 m, using only wrist action and doing my best to get the initial motion purely horizontal. The can hit the floor d = 2 m out from the point directly below where I released it. The initial velocity was, then, v = d / t = 2 m / 0.5 s = 4 m/s.
1093607|ALSJ||On the Moon, an object dropped or tossed horizontally from a height of 1.2 m would hit the ground after t = sqrt(2xh/g) = sqrt(2x1.2/1.63) = 1.2 seconds. If tossed with an initial horizontal velocity of 4 m/s, it would have landed at a distance d = vxt = 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 m. Given the necessary uncertainties in the actual distance the ring flew, the height at which Neil released the ring, and its initial velocity, 4.8 meters is acceptably close to the estimated distance of 5.5 meters.
1093633|ALSJ||Neil is trying to open his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pckt388809.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">pocket</a> - and get the loop of Velcro pile on the outside of the top flap to mate with a corresponding strip of Velcro hooks attached to the front of the suit at about hip height, without being able to see either because his RCU and camera are blocking his view. He then puts the sample in the pocket, again by feel.
1093633|ALSJ|CDR|It was a special pocket. It was on the right (means 'left') thigh.
1093633|ALSJ||Many members of the later crews wore and used one or two strap-on pockets on either the thigh or, in the case of Apollo 16 and 17, to the shin. Neil's strap-on pocket can be seen on his left thigh in the 16 mm film shot out Buzz's window.
1093647|ALSJ||EMU probably wanted a suit status report from Neil, which he gave immediately after EMU's call to Flight.
1093740|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1093827.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm camera shows Neil looking toward the ladder. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1093827HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">high-resolution version</a> is also available. The next <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1093828.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> shows Neil with his left hand raised. Because he doesn't lower any of his visors, he may be shielding his eyes from the Sun as he looks up toward the porch. Scans by Kipp Teague.
1093911|ALSJ||This is Neil's heart rate. See <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11MIssionReport_1971015566_Sec12BiomedEvaluation.pdf" target="alsj">figure 12-3</a> from the Mission Report. The graph seems to represent Neil's heart rate averaged over intervals of roughly 30 seconds. The Flight Surgeon may be reporting a maximum rate over some longer interval. Neil's rate reached 125 at about 109:34, and about 130 shortly before 109:20.
1093911|ALSJ||Two means of training for operations in one-sixth g is (1) to work in a water tank with extra weights worn to give you an effective weight of one-sixth g; or (2) to fly in a KC135 aircraft (the transport version of the Boeing 707) as it flies successive parabolas. On each parabola, you can get about a half minute of one-sixth g. I asked if they'd had much egress training in either a water tank or in the 135.
1093911|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think so. The procedure for getting out of the hatch takes longer than the (aircraft) parabola.
1093911|ALSJ|LMP|We probably had some kind of a backpack, pressurized. You did it in crude training gear, not flight gear, and in one g and concluded that it probably wouldn't be difficult.
1093911|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't do much aircraft <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a>. A lot less than we did in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-GeminiSumConf.html" target="alsj">Gemini</a>. I did a lot in Gemini and I suppose you did too."
1093911|ALSJ|LMP|I had a few records with successive parabolas. I think we did some for Apollo 11. I think maybe that was the time we... Yeah, we'd had a little bit of space sickness in some of the flights, like (Frank) Borman (on Apollo 8) and Rusty (Schweickart on Apollo 9, both of whom suffered from zero-g induced disorientation and nausea), and I don't know whether we had much of a concern or indication from the 10 crew but it was beginning to be a growing concern as to what the room in the Command Module might do.
1093911|ALSJ||None of the Mercury or Gemini flights produced any reports of discomfort or nausea in zero-g, but some of the astronauts on the early Apollo flights suffered dramatically. One theory was that, in the earlier spacecraft, the astronauts sat in tight quarters for the whole mission and, among other things, had no chance to move their heads very much. In the Apollo Command Module, you could move about freely and, so, disturb the inner ear.
1093911|ALSJ|LMP|And I felt that shaking the head around during zero-g with a suit over me would test my system to see whether I had any concern. It probably wasn't very good. As I mentioned the other night, I don't think moving your head has that much to do with it at all. Anyway, I rode that trainer more for SAS (Space Adaptation Syndrome). And I don't remember that we did contingency sampling or anything like that (on the airplane flights).
1093911|ALSJ||Current thinking is that, rather than being motion related, Space Adaptation Syndrome occurs in some people because they have trouble coordinating the information coming from their inner ears and from their eyes. After a day or so, almost all people adapt and the queasiness goes away.
1093911|ALSJ|CDR|We did some one-sixth g, but not much. But we did a little of it, I think, more to test walking and things like that. I don't remember that we ever did it in suits.
1093911|ALSJ||They also had a training device called the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#POGO" target="alsj">POGO</a>, which was a contraption build of cables and booms to give a walking astronaut a sensation of one-sixth g. I asked if they had done any training with it.
1093911|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah. But we weren't great believers in that.
1093911|ALSJ|CDR|There was one (POGO) that partially lifted your weight with cables from above, and then there were others where you were suspended at an angle so that you had one-sixth of your weight against a board. It wasn't very good.
1093911|ALSJ||In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-InclinedPlane5903.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">schematic drawing</a>, we see Buzz walking toward us along a board inclined 9.6 degrees to the wall of the simulator facility. One-sixth of his weight is pressing on the board, with the remainder being carried to suspension cables hooked to a carriage mounted on an overhead rail.
1093911|ALSJ||I remarked that they seemed to have no trouble adapting to one-sixth g.
1093911|ALSJ|LMP|I think our comments after the flight were that you didn't need to do one-sixth simulations very much for mobility purposes. I would think even less for Mars.
1093943|ALSJ||This is the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html" target="alsj">backup Hasselblad</a> with a color magazine, as per surface checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur26.gif" title="image" target="alsj">Sur-26</a>.
1093943|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that it would be on the floor of the LM on the Commander's side - the left side - so that we could just reach in the door and get it if we needed it.
1093943|ALSJ||Neil is correct. See the discussion following <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html#1112726" target="alsj">111:27:26</a>.
1093943|ALSJ||This still begs the question of why they didn't plan to fly and use two EVA cameras, as did the later crews.
1093943|ALSJ||As per his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>, Neil is standing southwest of the ladder, taking pictures as Buzz gets out of the spacecraft.

1094050|ALSJ||The SRC is the Sample Return Container, the vacuum-sealed rock box. Two SRCs are <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">stowed in the MESA</a> and will be lifted up to the cabin with the LEC at the end of the EVA.
1094128|ALSJ||The hatch can be opened from the outside, if necessary. The reason for almost closing the hatch is, I believe, to prevent radiative cooling of the cabin. Neither Neil or Buzz remembered any specific reason.
1094128|ALSJ|CDR|To avoid having somebody say 'Were you born in a barn?'
1094128|ALSJ|LMP|Now that you bring it up, what would have happened if the valve had gotten screwed up or something and it started re-pressurizing?
1094128|ALSJ|CDR|You'd never get back in.
1094128|ALSJ|LMP|Did we really ever investigate that problem? (Chuckling) It probably would have been a good idea to use a brick or a camera to keep it from closing. Somebody must have thought about that.
1094128|ALSJ||I recalled that the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/DumpValve.html" target="alsj">dump valve</a> could be opened from the outside.
1094128|ALSJ|LMP|We had a handle (on the outside) to unlatch it. But, considering the difficulty we had, if you had a couple of psi (in the cabin), you'd never get it open. (Half seriously) Well, you'd get it open, but you'd never get the bent hatch closed again.
1094128|ALSJ||Actually, the handle is the weak point.
1094128|ALSJ|LMP|Once I had my feet and posterior out the hatch, Neil was in good position to help me move out, by just observing the profile of the PLSS and it matched with the hatch opening.
1094128|ALSJ|CDR|The two-man operation is good, because all the help that each man can give the other is money in the bank.
1094128|ALSJ|LMP|I think the first man moving out (that is, Neil) has a little bit more difficulty because the second man has to be back behind the hatch and has to try to move it out of the way. So you have the tendency to be more over to your (Neil's) side away from the hatch and anything you are contacting was usually on your side - your edge of the lower part of the DSKY table.
1094128|ALSJ||Other crews pointed out that the LMP also had an easier time because his suit pressure was lower. During cabin depress, the relative suit pressures increase and it takes a while for breath-down - oxygen conversion to carbon dioxide which is scrubbed out by the lithium hydroxide canisters in the PLSSs - to bring the suit pressures down to the operating level of 3.7 to 3.8 psi. Consequently, the Commanders usually had harder, less flexible suits when they were going out than did the later-emerging LMPs.
1094156|ALSJ|LMP|The platform, itself, afforded a more-than-adequate position to transition from going out the hatch to getting on the ladder. The initial step is a little bit difficult to see. When I got to the first one, I was glad to have you tell me about where my feet were relative to that first step so that I didn't have to make a conscious effort to look around to the side or underneath. What I am getting at is that the operations on the platform can be carried out without concern about losing your balance and falling off. There is plenty of area up there to stand on the step and do any manipulating that might be required.
1094242|ALSJ||Neil's photo AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5868HR.jpg" target="alsj">5868</a> shows Buzz with one foot on the bottom rung and, as he says, his hands at the fourth rung.
1094242|ALSJ||Buzz jumps down to the footpad.
1094253|ALSJ||Buzz tries to jump up to the bottom rung and doesn't quite make it on the first try.
1094253|ALSJ||Buzz jumps up to the bottom rung.
1094306|ALSJ||Buzz jumps back down to the footpad.
1094306|ALSJ||Use rates of oxygen, cooling water, and electric power are as expected.
1094306|ALSJ||Still holding on to the ladder with both hands, Buzz hops backwards onto the surface. After a brief moment, he turns to his left toward the MESA.
1094306|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek calls attention to a comment on page 241 in Buzz's book </i>Men from Earth<i>: "We were both in the sun again, our helmets close together. Neil leaned toward me and clapped his gloved hand on my shoulder. 'Isn't it fun?' he said." Although the audio is certainly open to interpretation, the context seems to favor "Isn't it fine?". It doesn't appear from the TV that either Neil or Buzz is sunlit at this point.
1094423|ALSJ||Buzz moves back from the ladder and tries a few short jumps up. In the background, Neil does three fairly high jumps. During the last of these, he is off the ground for approximately 1.6 seconds which, in lunar gravity, means that he launched himself with an upward speed of about 1.3 m/s and got up about 0.5 meters. This is similar to a pair of much-better-documented, jumping salutes John Young did during Apollo 16 at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.alsepoff.html#1202542" target="alsj">120:25:42</a>.
1094423|ALSJ|CDR|I would say that balance (while walking) was not difficult; however, I did some fairly high jumps and found that there was a tendency to tip over backwards on a high jump. One time I came close to falling and decided that was enough of that.
1094455|ALSJ||Buzz held onto the ladder with his right hand and reached down with his left. Later pictures of Buzz - AS11-40- <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5873HR.jpg" target="alsj">5873</a>, for example - show some dust on his knees, possibly picked up at this point.
1094455|ALSJ|LMP|I was probably flexing my knees, but not a whole lot.
1094455|ALSJ|CDR|The operation of the suit, in general, was very pleasant. There was very little hindrance to mobility, with the exception of going down to the surface to pick things up with your hands, which was a very difficult thing to do. As far as walking around and getting from one place to another, the suit offered very little impediment to that kind of progress. It was, in general, a pleasant operation.
1094455|ALSJ||As per his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>. Buzz will now spend a few minutes getting familiar with the lunar environment ("Envir Fam"). While Buzz is doing that, Neil will <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">change lenses</a> on the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> and then deploy it out away from the LM so that Houston can watch the EVA from a better viewpoint.
1094455|ALSJ||Buzz lets go of the ladder and begins twist his torso to his left and then right; hops a time or two, and shifts his weight from foot to foot.
1094455|ALSJ||EVA thinks this is a good idea, both for safety purposes and to let Neil see what Buzz's movements look like. Buzz had the advantage of watching Neil out the LM window prior to his own egress.
1094625|ALSJ||At some point - probably before 109:49:06 when Neil takes the blankets off the MESA in preparation for moving the TV - he takes AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5870HR.jpg" target="alsj">5870</a> of the north footpad and probe and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5871HR.jpg" target="alsj">5871</a> of the area behind the ladder strut. As Neil started to say at 109:46:25, in 5870 we see that the farthest extent of the hole the north probe made is well separated from the tip of the probe, indicating that the spacecraft drifted to the south between contact and touchdown.
1094740|ALSJ||Buzz has set the voice-actuated keying control for the LM downlink at 8 rather than the maximum setting of 9. This represents a loss of about 7 dB in sensitivity. During most of the EVA, Buzz's transmissions are near the threshold and garbled sequences are frequent. For some reason, losses from Neil's transmissions are much less frequent.
1094740|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know what I could have really been referring to. It was probably that you might think that you're secure but you might slide down. I think it was probably a stability comment rather than a geological comment.
1094740|ALSJ|CDR|It might be that the surface is a little bit like powered charcoal and those little particles might act as a lubricant.
1094740|ALSJ|LMP|I think I was trying to convey that, rather than (implying that there was) any fluid. One might slide. If you were on something. That's the best interpretation I can put on that.
1094752|ALSJ||Buzz may be saying that dust kicked onto a rock surface fills up any small holes and make the surface slippery.
1094752|ALSJ||Neil goes to the MESA where he will remove the thermal blankets covering the MESA, preparing to change the lens and move the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> out away from the LM.
1094752|ALSJ||<b>More FD Loop to be added.
1094825|ALSJ||This is probably a reference to astronaut Jack Schmitt who, later, will fly as the Apollo 17 LMP.
1094825|ALSJ|LMP|If you're pretty light weight and get some action going (moving your arms down sharply), maybe you'd lift up a little. If you were really light weight. That must be what I'm trying to say.
1094825|ALSJ|CDR|One of Buzz's particular responsibilities was to evaluate mobility and stability, moving around on the surface and those kinds of things. And I'm sure he was commenting on those kinds of things whenever he had the opportunity.
1094940|ALSJ||During the Apollo 17 review, Jack Schmitt recalled that some geologists had been critical of Buzz's use of the term "biotite" which, formally, is a black to dark green form of mica. What Buzz was looking at was not biotite; however, as Schmitt points out, the description gave an excellent first impression of the appearance of the minerals Buzz could see in the rocks. Schmitt believes that the criticism was entirely unwarranted and, more than twenty years after the fact, still gets angry when he thinks about it.
1094940|ALSJ|LMP|It didn't bother me too much.
1094940|ALSJ|CDR|(Chuckling) All the geologists have vested interests; they make statements (that) they work hard to defend.
1094940|ALSJ|LMP|The statement about 'purple' rocks was really a stretch of being kind of facetious (that is, he was joking). But it didn't come off. Since it didn't come off well, I let it go at that. What I was kind of thinking of was 'what's the most absurd color you could think of for a rock?' 'Purple.' But it just didn't come out right.
1095059|ALSJ|CDR|I had to physically remove the lens from the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> and put a different one on. I think it was stored with the camera on the MESA. My recollection is that all the TV pictures after the initial ones were taken from a distance away. But the first one, since the MESA was very close to the ladder, needed a wide angle. We never used that (lens) again."
1095059|ALSJ||As indicated in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">MESA diagram</a>, the wide-angle lens is stowed at the right side near the bottom.
1095059|ALSJ||Neil will move the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> to a point about 20 meters northwest of the LM, the length of the cable connecting it to the spacecraft. For coverage of the first footstep, the camera was equipped with a short focal length lens.
1095224|ALSJ||Mauro Freschi has provided a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1095224_bw.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">B&amp;W TV frame</a> originally published by Dick Lattimer and a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1095224_clr.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">colorized version</a>.
1095227|ALSJ|LMP|I (just now) asked Neil whether the plaque was on the checklist, because I doubt that it was. 'Cause I didn't have one.
1095227|ALSJ||I learned long after the mission review that Buzz is incorrect in remembering that only Neil had a checklist. They each had a checklist sewn on the left-glove wrist cover. Buzz's checklist is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38937.jpg" target="alsj">here</a> and Neil's is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38898.jpg" target="alsj">here</a>. As can be seen in transcriptions of the checklists; there is no mention of the plaque in either <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">Neil's </a> or <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">Buzz's</a>.
1095227|ALSJ|LMP|And it (meaning the plaque) was a fairly late in the training activity. So was the flag. I don't recall that I knew how to open the door on the plaque or where the flag really was.
1095227|ALSJ||The 'door' that Buzz mentions is a curved, hinged metal cover. Pre-flight photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-39193.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-39193</a> shows a technician holding the cover open prior to installation. Scan by Kipp Teague / Frederic Artner.

Scan by Paul Fjeld.
1095227|ALSJ|LMP|So, if it was a one-man EVA and I was out, I don't know that I would have known how to do that. The point I may be making is that, when someone says 'How was your training?' Well, there were a few things that we didn't quite get to in all that training. But we kept damn busy in all the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a> we were doing, but we didn't always cover everything 'cause some things were coming in kind of late in the game."
1095227|ALSJ||According to a 1993 NASA Contractor Report '<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-usflag.html" target="alsj">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>' by Anne M. Platoff, the final decision to deploy the plaque and flag was not made until shortly before launch. However, design of the flag assembly started about three months before launch and training versions were delivered to the Cape on 25 June 1969, late enough that there would have been very few opportunities to practice the deployment in a schedule otherwise dominated by preparations for flight operations.
1095227|ALSJ|CDR|There were changes. It was evolutionary.
1095227|ALSJ||I asked if the PLSSs were identical.
1095227|ALSJ|CDR|I think they were identical. The question arises whether our names - our spelled out names - were on the back of the PLSSs. I didn't think they were. Some guy said he thought they were.
1095227|ALSJ|LMP| can be clearly read in good prints of AS11-40-<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5942HR.jpg" target="alsj">5942</a>. An excellent reproduction can be found in Michael Light's superb book </i>Full Moon<i>. Thomas Schwagmeier has provided an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5942_buzz_name.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">enhanced detail</a> from the more recent high-resolution scans of the original film. Burton notes that Neil's name tag can be seen, but not read, in AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5886HR.jpg" target="alsj">5886</a>.
1095227|ALSJ||Not counting this cosmetic difference, the only functional difference between the PLSSs was in the comm system. Prior to 1967, NASA had planned to have only one of the LM crewmen go outside on an EVA. When that decision was changed, it was discovered that it would not be possible to easily re-design the communications system so that both astronauts could transmit simultaneously to the LM. It was decided, however, that one of the PLSSs could serve as a relay station, picking up voice and data from the non-relay astronaut and then sending the combined voice and data from both astronauts to the LM. The Commander's PLSS was modified to serve this function. See <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LMcomm.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Figure 2</a> in "Apollo Experience Report: Lunar Module Communications System", NASA document MSC-04031 by R.H. Dietz, D.E. Rhoades, and L.J. Davidson, 1972.
1095240|ALSJ||Syd Buxton has provided a cleaned-up version of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">a B&amp;W reproduction of the plaque</a> he found on the MSFC website.
1095340|ALSJ||They move to face the MESA.
1095345|ALSJ||For a long time I thought I heard the last phrase as "but dirty looking", rather than the original NASA transcription of "but very pretty looking". In 2012, Journal Contributor Brian Riley convinced me that "but really pretty looking" is correct.
1095345|ALSJ||The TV cable is also <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">stowed</a> on the righthand side of the MESA. Even in the restored video, Neil starts moving the TV before we get clear look at Buzz pulling cable out.
1095445|ALSJ||Neil starts taking the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> off the MESA. Sometime between 109:55:19 and 109:55:25, the inverter switch at Parkes is changed in anticipation of Neil setting the camera upright on the surface. When the switch position is changed, the Parkes spot moves from below center near the left edge to above center near the right edge.
1095445|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> has a patch - called a tempa-label - with a series of spots on it which change color from white to black at successively higher temperatures. A detail from Apollo 13 training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../tempa-label.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">70-H-103</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a fuel-transfer tool. At the moment, all of the patches are showing their "cold" color, an indication that the interior of the MESA was not hot.
1095532|ALSJ|CDR|You probably went from Max back to Intermediate.
1095532|ALSJ||As shown in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5963.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5963" target="alsj">5963</a>, there is a control lever on the lower right, front corner of Buzz's PLSS that allows him to select the rate at which heat is transferred between the closed-loop <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../apollo.glossary.html#LCG" target="alsj">LCG</a> water supply and the sublimator feedwater. There are three detents which allow him to select Minimum cooling, Intermediate, or Maximum, although settings between the detents would also work.
1095532|ALSJ|CDR|Thermal loads in the suit were not bad at all; I ran on minimum flow almost the entire time. Buzz found a higher flow to be desirable. This was consistent with our individual pre-flight experience. I didn't notice any temperature thermal differences in and out of the (LM) shadow. There were slight light differences and visibility changes, but no thermal differences. The only temperature problem I had - and Buzz didn't have this problem - was with the gloves. I did not wear inner gloves. I chose to go without the inner liners in the gloves (which would have provided some relief from abrasion, at a cost of reduced dexterity), and my hands were a little warm and very wet all the time. They got very damp and clammy inside the gloves. I found that this problem degraded my ability to handle objects and to get firm grips on things.
1095532|ALSJ||Dampness in the gloves, together with abrasion from the inner surface of the glove and from the wrist ring, was a recurring problem for the Apollo crews. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#LCG" target="alsj">LCG</a> did not extend past the wrists and, so, provided no cooling to the hands. In addition, the necessarily tight fit of the gloves prevented any airflow onto the hands and, therefore, meant that there was no way to keep them dry.
1095532|ALSJ|LMP|I had cooler levels set on the (feedwater) diverter valve, because it just seemed to be comfortably pleasant that way. In retrospect, it appears that this leads toward a higher consumption of water. I wasn't fully aware that, when you are on a higher flow, you are going to be pumping more water overboard. It was not clear to me pre-flight that it did have that effect on your water consumption. I certainly could have operated at lower levels much sooner without overheating.
1095532|ALSJ||NASA planners had expected Neil to use 5.4 pounds of cooling water during the EVA and Buzz 5.1 pounds. In reality, Neil used a mere 2.9 pounds, while Buzz used 4.4. That is, while both of them used significantly less water than had been expected, Buzz's preference for Intermediate cooling showed an even more noticeable effect.
1095532|ALSJ|LMP|In confirmation of Neil's findings, I didn't experience any hot or even warm spots in the suit. I didn't wear any inner glove, either, in my desire to get a better feel through the gloves. During the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="alsj">donning</a>, I did not have the wristlets on. (The wristlets were designed to provide protection against abrasion by the wrist rings that connect the gloves to the suit.) I thought that the LCG extending down far enough into the wrist would be adequate. If I had to repeat this effort, I would put the wristlets on, because once I was in the gloves and I started moving them around, I did find that it was rubbing a small amount on the wrist. I thought that it might get to be more annoying than it actually turned out to be; but, looking back, I would have preferred having those wristlets on."
1095532|ALSJ||One of the LM landing struts comes into view in the TV picture. The 16-mm film suggests that this is the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> (north) strut.
1095550|ALSJ|CDR|It seems to me that I'm starting the process of moving the television camera. Buzz is standing there to help the cable come out and so on; and, while he's doing that, he's probably just noting other observations in the immediate LM area.
1095635|ALSJ||As can be seen in the 16-mm film clip, Neil stops and examines a small, fresh crater. It probably has glass in the bottom, an indication of a relatively-recent, high-velocity impact. Craters dug by objects coming in at high velocity from space are called primary craters. Impacts by ejecta from craters dug elsewhere on the moon necessarily occur at velocities less than the lunar escape speed of 2.4 km/s and do not have enough energy to melt the target soil.
1095635|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1095659.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows Neil just as he starts to move beyond the small crater. Scan by Kipp Teague.
1095753|ALSJ||That is, Neil wants to avoid pointing the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a> at the Sun. Unlike the cameras used on Apollo 15, 16 and 17, this camera is very light sensitive and lacks an automatic irising capability. The Apollo 12 crew will accidentally burn out their TV by pointing it at the Sun.
1095753|ALSJ||NASA photos <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-33922.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-33922</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-33923.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-33923</a> shows Neil positioning the TV inside the Training Building at the Cape in April 1969.
1095753|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11WstnghseTp.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photo</a> taken in 2004 at the National Air and Space Museum by Ulrich Lotzmann shows marks on the top of a Westinghouse B&amp;W TV indicating the field-of-view when the camera is equipped with either the "80-degree Wide Angle lens" or, as the Apollo 11 camera is now, the "35-degree Lunar Day lens". See, also, the 35-degree field-of-view indicated by blue lines in Thomas Schwagmeier's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11traverse.gif" target="alsj">rendition</a> of Figure 3-16 from the Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report.
1095801|ALSJ||The TV ended up about 18 meters (60 feet) from the MESA and, as Buzz indicates here, the cable wasn't much longer than that. The Parkes spot is now near the right edge of the frame.
1095801|ALSJ||The Solar Wind Collector (SWC) consists of a sheet of thin aluminum foil 30 cm wide by 140 cm long which will be exposed to the Sun - for 77 minutes in this case - so that it can trap ions of helium, neon, and argon in the solar wind. Buzz will assemble a mounting staff, unroll the foil, and stick the staff into the ground with the foil surface at right-angles to the direction of the Sun.
1095905|ALSJ||Neil will move the TV around the horizon by steps to give Houston a general view of the area around the LM.
1095905|ALSJ||On the Rover missions, the TV camera could be panned at a fairly high rate without creating any serious blurring of the image. Not so with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">this camera</a>.
1095905|ALSJ||Bruce is reporting that the scientists in the Backroom have looked at this view long enough and, of course, have taken polaroid snapshots of the image on a monitor. Neil's time is too valuable to spend much time on any one view. On the Rover missions, the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/GCTA-Final-Report.pdf" target="alsj">TV camera</a> was operated from Houston and there was more freedom for the Backroom to take hard looks at particular objects with the TV - subject to the needs of others in Mission Control to watch what the astronauts were doing. Generally, the TV was more suited for watching the astronauts than for looking at geologic features. Photographs gave far better resolution than was possible with the TV and, so, were of more long-term value to the geologists. Although the geologists used the TV in real-time EVA planning, generally, it was more valuable as a means for Houston to get a feel for the conditions under which the astronauts were working and, occasionally, gave Houston a chance to let the crew know that they had dropped something or that a piece of equipment was being used improperly.
1095905|ALSJ||Readers should note that, although there were many groups of support personnel manning various "backrooms", in the Journal the capitalized form, "Backroom" refers specifically to the Science backroom, which played a large role in all the EVAs.
1100117|ALSJ||Buzz has raised the MESA "table" to which they can secure one of the rock boxes. The bag is a so-called weigh bag, a Teflon-film bag that they can use to hold rock and soil samples. Buzz has attached the bag to the edge of the MESA. These activities are not on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj"> checklist</a>. See the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">MESA diagram</a> (scan by Karl Dodenhoff). Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../tools/judy101.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">101</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Catalog show Neil pouring soil into a weigh bag during training.

The bag had rectangular metal frames at the top and bottom to help it hold its shape.
1100117|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, Buzz's shadow shows him moving to the right carrying the SWC (Solar Wind Collector), opening the package as he goes.
1100117|ALSJ||This pair of craters is shown best in the photographs taken out Neil's window. AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5452HR.jpg" target="alsj">5452</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5453HR.jpg" target="alsj">5453</a> are good examples.
1100117|ALSJ||Buzz does the SWC deployment a short distance north of the MESA. In the 16-mm film, he is just hidden behind the RCS thrusters outside the LMP window.
1100226|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Marv Hein calls attention to the bright, vertical streak which is just to the right of center and inclined slightly to the right. This is an artifact caused by a reflection inside the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a>, as can be seen when Neil makes the final adjustments to the pointing.
1100226|ALSJ||Neil moves away from the TV toward the LM.
1100324|ALSJ||As per his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det38898.jpg" target="alsj"> checklist</a>, Neil's two photos are AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5872HR.jpg" target="alsj">5872</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5873HR.jpg" target="alsj">5873</a>. See, also, a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11map5872-75and76-80.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">detail</a> from Vlad Pustynski's photogrammetric map.
1100324|ALSJ|LMP|In putting (the SWC pole) in the ground, it went down about 4 or 5 inches. It wasn't quite as stable as I would have liked it to have been, but it was adequate to hold it in a vertical position...Once you go past a depth of 4 or 5 inches, the ground gets quite hard. However, I didn't get much of a cue to this at this point while installing the solar wind experiment.
1100324|ALSJ|LMP|The way that the soil is in front, it moves with the boot. Five or six inches seems like an awful long distance to me right now.
1100324|ALSJ|CDR|What do you think you were saying that got transcribed as 'bay'? It sort of sounds like 'bay' but I'm sure that's not what it is.
1100324|ALSJ|LMP|What I think I'm trying to get across (at the beginning of the statement) is, in these small depressions, that you sink in on the edges of them two or three inches; whereas before you get to them - or in the center - it's back to a quarter of an inch, maybe. In other words, a loose consistency is where there's a change in slope.
1100324|ALSJ||Buzz's other observation, confirming what experimenters saw when they commanded the various Surveyor spacecraft to push their mechanical scoops forward through the soil, is that, out in front of the scoop or boot, a section of soil tends to move as one. And, at the front edge of this co-moving section, there is a sharp line of demarcation. Journal Contributor Thomas Schwagmeier notes that, at the right temperature, snow behaves in a similar fashion.
1100324|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, we see Neil stop and examine the area around the small crater he stopped at on the way out with the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11TVmanual.html" target="alsj">TV camera</a>.
1100324|ALSJ||Andy Chaikin notes that, in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11dac1100443.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">series of frames</a> from the 16mm film taken as Buzz approached the MESA, we see him kick the contingency sample handle out of the way. The handle disappears off-screen left between frames 4 and 5.
1100324|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11chaikinfav.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">later frame</a> shows Neil approaching the LM. Chaikin says that this is his favorite image of Neil on the lunar surface.
1100504|ALSJ||Next, Neil and Buzz will deploy the U.S. Flag. The flag deployment is not listed in either checklist. A detail discussion of the flag assembly and the decision to deploy it can be found in Anne Platoff's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-usflag.html" target="alsj">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>'. The flag is stowed in a thermal shroud under the lefthand ladder rail as shown in NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/mccraw.gif" title="image" target="alsj">S69-38755</a>. See, also, Neil's photo of Buzz on the bottom ladder rung, AS11-40-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5868" target="alsj">5868</a>.
1100504|ALSJ||At about 110:05:20, about 2 min 27 secs into the 16-mm clip, what may be the flag shroud can be seen in three successive screen grabs from the spacecraft Films version of the clip. The shroud is about a meter long and is the top item in Figure 5 in Platoff's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-usflag.html" target="alsj">paper</a>. The three screen grabs have been combined in a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo11DACframesFlagShroud.pdf" target="alsj">pdf document</a> along with screen grabs immediately before and after the three of interest. Screen Grab 1 shows the scene a moment after Neil and Buzz entered the LM shadow at the lower left to get the flag off the left rail of the ladder. Note that the camera mounted over Buzz's window gives a view to the northwest. Shadows extend diagonally up and to the left (west) from the objects casting them. Screen Grab 2 shows a dark streak that extends from center left diagonally up and to the right, and ends just above a foot-sized rock. A second streak is below and to the right and has a kink just before its upper-right end. Although it gives the appearance of a shadow of the more prominent streak, if the prominent streak were a physical object casting a shadow on the ground, the shadow would be above and to the left, rather than below and to the right. Sreen Grab 2 also included a short streak above and the the left of the prominent streak. Screen Grab 3 includes ghosts of the three streaks from the Screen Grab 2. These may be the result of processing done to produce the video version of the 1 frame-per-second 16mm film. There is, however, a new streak similar in length and orientation to the prominent streak in Screen Grab 2, but starting just beyond its upper-right end. Screen Grab 4 shows the "new" streak on it's own and a bit darker. Although it is tempting to believe that the prominent streak and the "new" streak represent the flag shroud in flight, it seems more likely that we are seeing either scanning artifacts or something that was briefly on the film while it was being exposed. Thanks to Paolo Attivissimo for calling attention to these frames, for providing the screen grabs, and for most of the observations reported here.
1100701|ALSJ||Part 2 of Mark Gray's April 2013 YouTube release of the restored video alongside the synched 16-mm film begins at 110:07:01.
1100701|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, Neil and Buzz head out in the general direction of the TV camera, Buzz carrying the lower part of the flagstaff and Neil carrying the assembly consisting of the flag, the upper section of the flagstaff, and the crossbar.
1100701|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/assembly.gif" title="image" target="alsj">flag assembly</a> consists of a staff and an extendable crossbar. These two pieces were joined by a locking hinge at the top of the staff. The nylon flag measures 3 feet by 5 feet and has a hem shown into the top into which the cross bar has been inserted. The flag has also been attached to the staff at two points.
1100701|ALSJ|CDR|We'll start here with the flag installation. It went as planned, except that the telescoping top rod could not be extended. Both Buzz and I operating together were unable to put enough force into extending the rod. It appeared to just be stuck and we gave up trying. So the flag was partially folded when we installed it on the flagstaff. I suspect that didn't show very much on television, but our still photographs should show the result of that.
1100701|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film at about 110:07:30, Neil pivots the top rod so that it is perpendicular to the staff.
1100701|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film at about 110:08:00, Neil is now farthest from the LM with his back to the TV and they both seem to be pulling on the top rod, trying to extend it.
1100814|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film at about 110:08:30, the flagstaff has been assembled and Buzz is holding the flag by the top rod as he works to extend it.
1100814|ALSJ|LMP|There's a <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-40308.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photograph</a> in the 16-mm (movie film) and one of us (Neil) is kind of holding the staff and the other's pulling the flag out. I don't think you can tell by looking at the photograph who's who. I don't know whether anybody traced through actions here (in the TV or the 16-mm film). And I don't know if I remember.
1100814|ALSJ|LMP|We were trying to pull it out all the way?
1100814|ALSJ|CDR|It didn't come to its full length.
1100814|ALSJ|LMP|Neither of us could extend it. We thought maybe we could extend the rod by both pulling, but then we didn't want to exert too much force because if it ever gave way, we'd probably find ourselves off balance. I don't know how we'll ever find out what happened. I suspect this is just something that may, in some way, be due to thermal conditions or vacuum welding or something like that. It came out of its mount fairly easily. I thought we had a little bit of trouble with one of the pip pins (a removable locking pin) there for a while.
1100853|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1100845.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows Neil facing the LM and Buzz facing the TV camera. Scan by Kipp Teague.
1100925|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film by about this time, the top rod is extended about as far as it is going to go and Buzz is holding the flag by the top rod as he works to extend it. Neil then takes the flagstaff while Buzz moves to the right and watches him try to get pole into the surface.
1100925|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that NASA photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-39815.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-39815</a> was taken in the MOCR at about this time. Ken Glover pinpoints the time as 110:09:25.
1100939|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, Buzz comes over and takes hold of the bottom, outside corner of the flag and tugs on it. He loses his grip.
1100952|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, Buzz backs away again and salutes. He then moves back to the flag and grabs both the top and bottom corners and pulls while Neil holds the staff. Journal Contributor Bob Farwell has inserted a frame from the 16-mm film into a post-EVA <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11postpanDAC.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">pan</a> which merges the views out both windows. A certain amount of artistic license is required to join the two window views and, as well, to fit in the 16-mm frame. The 16-mm camera is mounted at the top of the LMP window and, therefore, the perspective on the near surface is different from the Hasselblad images.
1100952|ALSJ||In the TV picture, Neil is on the right and Buzz is on the left.
1101033|ALSJ||Journal Contributors Owen Merrick, Brian McInall, and Markus Mehring call attention to the fact that, as shown in a high-resolution version <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5875BuzzFace.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> by Thomas Schwagmeier from AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5875HR.jpg"target="alsj">5875</a>, we can see Buzz peering over at Neil. In <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5874HR.jpg" target="alsj">5874</a> Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned slightly to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim. Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case "his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it. But in this case we're lucky." Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11-40-5874-75.gif" title="image" target="alsj">animated gif image</a> consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet. Note, in particular, the change in his knee positions. The TV record of this interval shows Buzz turning in Neil's direction twice during this interval.
1101033|ALSJ|CDR|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PostFlightPressConf.html target="alsj">Post mission press conference</a>) - "We had some difficulty, at first, getting the pole of the flag to remain in the surface. In penetrating the surface, we found that most objects would go down about 5, maybe 6, inches and then it would meet with a gradual resistance. At the same time, there was not much of a support force on either side, so we had to lean the flag back slightly in order for it to maintain this position."
1101033|ALSJ||Later crews hammered the staff into the ground.
1101033|ALSJ||According to Platoff's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-usflag.html" target="alsj">history of the Apollo 11 flag</a>, "The base of the lower section was designed with a hardened steel point to make it easier to drive into the lunar soil." As Buzz will discover when he tries to hammer two core tubes into the surface at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html#1111513" target="alsj">111:15:13</a>, the regolith is very tightly compacted below a few inches and, apparently, Neil is unable to put enough force on the tip of the staff to allow it to penetrate any appreciable distance. During the Apollo 12 flag deployment at about <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.tvtrbls.html#1161412" target="alsj">116:14:12</a>, Al Bean will hammer the bottom section (with its top suitably hardened) about a foot into the ground without encountering any increase in resistance with depth.
1101033|ALSJ|CDR|The flagstaff was pushed into the ground at a slight angle such that the c.g. (center of gravity) of the overall unit would tend to be somewhat above the point at which the flagstaff was inserted in the lunar surface. (That is, they tilted the flag so that it would balance.) That seemed to hold alright, but I noted later, after getting back into the LM, that the weight of the flag had rotated the entire unit about the flagpole axis such that the flag was no longer pointed in the same direction as it was originally. I suspect that the weight of the flagpole probably had shifted its position in the sand a little bit from the position where it had originally been installed.
1101033|ALSJ||The last flag images we have from before the rest period are Hasselblad images - such as <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5465HR.jpg" target="alsj">AS11-37-5465</a> - they took out the windows at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1122056" target="alsj">112:20:56</a> and Super-8 film showing the TV monitor at Honeysuckle Creek not long after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#11411xx" target="alsj"> 114:10:37</a> during the PLSS jettison. Both show the flag in its deployed configuration. The next flag images we have are from a DAC pan Buzz took not long after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1234832" target="alsj">123:48:32</a>. It is clear that the shift in flag orientation Neil noticed occured sometime after the PLSS jettison. Because Buzz took the DAC pan about an hour after the RCS hot-fire check at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1234832" target="alsj">123:48:32</a>, we have no way of knowing what configuration the flag was in after the shift Neil noticed.
1101033|ALSJ|LMP|How far would you estimate you got it into the ground?
1101033|ALSJ|CDR|Six to eight inches was about as far as I could get it in.
1101033|ALSJ|LMP|It was fairly easy to get it down the first 4 or 5 inches.
1101033|ALSJ|CDR|It gets hard quickly.
1101221|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVAGjO2dtUA" target="alsj">Part 2</a> of Mark Gray's April 2013 YouTube release of the restored video alongside the synched 16-mm film began at 110:07:01.
1101221|ALSJ||Neil is now at the MESA. As indicated on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj"> checklist</a>, he is preparing to collect the bulk sample and, as well, puts his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html" target="alsj">Hasselblad camera</a> on the MESA about now. The scoop he will use is <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">stowed</a> on the lefthand side of the MESA.
1101221|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Marv Hein calls attention to the bright, slightly-inclined, vertical streak which is just to the right of the flag, This is an artifact caused by a reflection in the TV camera, as can be seen when Neil adjusts the final pointing at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1100226" target="alsj">110:02:26</a>.
1101315|ALSJ||Buzz ran toward the west about 10 to 15 meters, then turned and came back toward the MESA. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1101325.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows him back at the MESA, just before he turns to face the TV camera.
1101342|ALSJ||Buzz is now at the TV camera and turns to run back to the LM one last time. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1101534.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows Buzz as he approaches the MESA at the end of his mobility tests. Note the arc of dust he kicked forward when he landed on his left foot.
1101342|ALSJ|LMP|You can't get very specific about (planning) what you're going to do in the way of evaluating mobility. Excepting kind of think about it. You can't script and choreograph left turns and right turns and all of this. But I had felt, really, that there would be a lot more evaluation made of what I was doing and maybe my comments. So when I came back and went through debriefing, I was really kind of disappointed that there wasn't some person or group that had done some evaluations. But, they did or they didn't. And that's it. They took our subjective comments. And we said to later crews, 'take the first couple of minutes and familiarize; and that's all you need.' But I was still kind of disappointed until, twenty years after the flight, I ran into a guy from Japan, named Seki, and he said that (reading from the letter), 'at the time, July 20, 1969, I gazed your jumping on television, holding tightly a stop watch in my hand. The television was the first color television of my home. We bought the instrument for the purpose to see the color of the Moon and to observe the activity - walking, moving - of you on the surface of the Moon. And I was relieved to certify that your jumping steps were just the same order of our calculated values on the Moon, based on our experimental data on Earth.' It (Seki's letter) renewed my faith that people cared about those things. And I got to say that I don't think it's a good testimony to our American way of thoroughness and looking at things that, if we're going to have competition in the world, we're going to have it from people who do do those things.
1101342|ALSJ||An extended discussion of the various gaits used by the Apollo crews, including comments by Neil and Buzz, is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.gaits.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|We were behind.
1101547|ALSJ|LMP|Possibly, the original schedule hadn't included the plaque and the flag.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|That's true (as can be seen in both <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj"> Neil's</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj"> Buzz's</a> checklists)."
1101547|ALSJ|LMP|And the Oval Office is just about to put us even further behind.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|Something like the flag was going to be done, but there was an uncertainty about what the flag would be and how it would be handled.
1101547|ALSJ||A 1993 NASA Contractor Report '<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-usflag.html" target="alsj">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>' by Anne M. Platoff details the history of the decision to deploy the U.S. flag during the Apollo 11 EVA. Although design of the flag assembly began about three months prior to launch and training versions were delivered to the Kennedy Space Center on 25 June 1969, the final decision was made late enough that the flag and plaque were installed on the Apollo 11 LM on launch day.
1101547|ALSJ||I asked if there had been many walkthroughs of the EVA.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|Quite a few. And they used those to determine the timeline and made measurements of different tasks. And we went through almost start to finish, finally, maybe a couple of times.
1101547|ALSJ|LMP|But not pressurized.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|In the sandbox in Houston. The sandbox was a test and practice area of about 100 feet square, located in one of the buildings at MSC (the Manned Spacecraft Center, now the Johnson Space Center). We practiced there a number of times.
1101547|ALSJ|LMP|But, of course, when you do something in the sandbox you have to make sure all the photographers are kept clear of you.
1101547|ALSJ||NASA photos <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6932243" target="alsj"> S69-32243</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6931080" target="alsj"> S69-31080</a> were taken during an 15 April 1969 Training/Public Relations <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">session</a>.
1101547|ALSJ|CDR|The final one was a real PR event. It was a photo opportunity; but we did go through the whole thing on that occasion, I think.
1101547|ALSJ|LMP|But it's not the kind of opportunity where you want to note difficulties and then sit there and discuss them in front of the media cameras. And if you don't do it then - we're not taking notes - then not all of it's going to be debriefed afterwards.
1101600|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1101754.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows Buzz on the left saluting at about 110:17:54, with Neil partially hidden by a LM thruster.
1101600|ALSJ||Buzz salutes a second time, as does Neil a few seconds later. The Apollo 11 recovery ship is the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Hornet. An <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-nara.html" target="alsj"> article</a> adapted from the National Archives and Records Administration includes the relevant section of the President's Daily Diary and the split-screen TV image seen by most of the watching world.
1101600|ALSJ||A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1101815.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film shows Neil (right) and Buzz (left) returning to the MESA.
1101831|ALSJ||After being out of sight for just a few seconds, Buzz walks part way toward the flag, turns to face the LM, looks down and kicks at the soil, sending a spray in a southerly direction. This is the "Scuff/Cohesion/Adhesion" activity on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj"> checklist</a>. In the TV view, he is at the extreme right and it is not as easy as in the 16-mm film to tell what he is doing.
1101831|ALSJ||Buzz now turns to face more or less west and kicks the surface again, probably wanting to see how the spray looks under different lighting conditions. Next Buzz walks beyond the flag to a relatively undisturbed area and kicks a spray of dirt toward the north. From this spot, he launches a half dozen sprays or so. Although Buzz is out of the TV field-of-view, the sprays of dirt can be seen coming from the right and landing in view of the TV.
1101831|ALSJ||Finally, like a kid at the beach, Buzz switches to a left-footed kick for one last kick before moving farther from the LM at about 110:19:30.
1102006|ALSJ|LMP|It catches your attention.
1102006|ALSJ|CDR|When you kick the surface, it makes a little fan which, to me, is in the shape of a rose petal or something. The particles all go out, and there's nothing behind 'em. There's just a little ring of particles - nothing behind 'em - no dust, no swirl, no nothing. They just go out in little, like, fans; and they kind of all hit together.
1102006|ALSJ|LMP|And the ones at the side don't go quite as far, so they hit first...
1102006|ALSJ|CDR|It's really unique.
1102006|ALSJ||Jones - "That description is actually a big help because you can see it several times in the J mission TV, but from such a low angle on the Rover that it's a little hard to see what's actually going on."
1102006|ALSJ|LMP|And I would guess that, for some reason, there must be an angle of departure when you kick the soil that way, that causes it to all leave at the same angle and velocity. Because, otherwise, it would leave at different angles and velocities and it wouldn't all land in the same ring. You don't see that here (on Earth), and maybe it's because the atmosphere immediately breaks things up into dust (sorts things by size), and there, it doesn't do that.
1102006|ALSJ||Buzz returns to the LM.
1102124|ALSJ||As can be seen in the shadows in the 16-mm film, Neil has been at the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap_g-h_mesa.gif" title="image" target="alsj">MESA</a>, getting the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy26.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">scoop</a> with which he will collect the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">bulk sample</a>, a non-selected sample of rock and soil. He has gone a short way north of the LM to get his first sample. Buzz comes over to help him get untangled.
1102124|ALSJ||The TV cable has been coiled up inside the LM for several weeks and, since being pulled out during the TV deployment, retained memory of the loops it had in storage. The cable loops are visible in AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5875" target="alsj">5875</a>. Note that each of the bootprints is 33 cm long and has a greatest width of 15 cm.
1102124|ALSJ||Paul Coan, Manned Spaceflight Center Television Subsystem Manager who was responsible for the equipment used on the Apollo spacecraft, writes, "We were concerned about how much volume the 100-foot lunar TV cable would occupy in the LM. So, Westinghouse worked out a clever double figure-8 pattern for stowing it in a box to minimize the volume. Technicians had to be trained to place the cable in the box using this pattern. Because of weight considerations, the box was never used except for transportation of the cable. For the missions, Grumman worked out the stowage of the cable. I don't recall if they used the double figure-8 pattern.
1102305|ALSJ||As Buzz comes over to the MESA, Neil turns to face him and, when Buzz suggests that they get the cable out of the way, Neil lifts the cable with the scoop he is carrying and extends the cable so that Buzz can take hold of it. Andy Chaikin has captured a series of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11tvcable16mm.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">16mm frame details</a>. The first frame (top left) shows Buzz at the left and Neil at the right with the TV cable on his scoop as indicated by the green arrow. In the second frame (top right), Neil has raised the scoop high enough for Buzz to grab the cable, which is indicated by two green arrows. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102237.jpg" title="image" target="alsj"> full frame</a> shows Buzz moving left with the TV cable. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102240.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">second full frame</a> shows the TV cable more clearly. In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102243.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">third frame</a> Buzz appears to be pulling the cable into a more-or-less straight line past the flag before getting the excess out of the way under the spacecraft.
1102305|ALSJ|LMP|This is one of the pitfalls of testing things in one g that you're going to use in reduced-g, because I'm sure that when we uncoiled the cable in one g it would lay flat. But not so there (on the Moon). There may be other reasons why it took a set, but it did not want to lay flat. It was just a trap when you hook a foot into it, because you can't see it too well
1102305|ALSJ|CDR|You really can't see your feet.
1102305|ALSJ|LMP|The same sort of thing came up later on, with the leveling <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#BB" target="alsj">BB</a> (on the seismometer). The experiment (originally) had a fluid bubble, but they came up with a new and different way of doing it. It had a depression with a BB in it, because they didn't want to deal with the fluid for some reason. Well, when I looked down at it, the damn thing was just going around and around and around at the top. It wouldn't do that in one g because it would be pulled down from there. (So, both the TV cable and the leveling BB demonstrate that), if you build something and it's a little different and you test it in one g, that isn't the way it's going to perform, necessarily, at one-sixth."
1102305|ALSJ|CDR|The TV was operated as planned with no particular difficulties. The one thing that gave us more trouble than we expected was the TV cable; I kept getting my feet tangled up in it. It's a white cable and was easily observable for a while. But it soon picked up the black dust which blended it in with the terrain, and it seemed that I was forever getting my foot caught in it. Fortunately, Buzz was able to notice this and keep me untangled. Here was good justification for the two men helping each other. There was no question about that, either; he was able to tell me which way to move my foot to keep out of trouble. We knew this might be a problem from our simulations, but there just was no way that we could avoid crossing back and forth across that cable. There was no camera location that could prevent a certain amount of traverse of this kind.
1102305|ALSJ|LMP|Neil initially pulled out about 20 feet of cable and, then, I pulled out the rest of it. It seemed to reach a stop; it seemed to have a certain amount of resistance, and I thought that was the end of the cable. However, when I pulled normal to the opening, I found that I could then extract the cable to the point where I saw the black and white marks on it. The cable, being wound around the mounting inside the MESA, developed a set to it so that, when it was lying on the surface in one-sixth g, it continued to have a spiral set to it which would leave it sticking up from the surface 3 or 4 inches. It would be advantageous if we could get rid of that some way.
1102305|ALSJ|CDR|Your foot is continually going underneath it as you walk, rather than over the top of it.
1102305|ALSJ|LMP|One time when Neil did get the cable wrapped around his foot, the cable very nearly wrapped itself over the top of the tab on the back of the boot. That created a problem in disentanglement. I don't know whether it's worth moving that tab or not.
1102305|ALSJ||One of Neil's photos of Buzz and the flag, AS11-40- <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5875" target="alsj">5875</a> shows the loops in the TV cable.
1102305|ALSJ||Like Neil and Buzz, the Apollo 12 and 14 crews had a continual problem with the TV cable and with the cable for the large, umbrella-shaped S-band antenna which they erected on each of the missions. For the J missions, the TV camera and high-gain antenna were mounted on the Rover and there were, of course, no cables connecting the Rover comm system to the LM. The changeover to the wireless, Rover-based comm eliminated cable problems around the LM. However, later crews had to contend with connecting cables on the much more elaborate arrays of scientific gear that they deployed and, on one occasion during the Apollo 16 ALSEP deployment, a cable was actually torn loose, disabling the experiment.
1102332|ALSJ||Buzz is about to perform the boot penetration task, "Pene-Photo Footprint" task on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a> and will be using the Hasselblad camera. Neil put it down on the MESA earlier, and Buzz picks it up at some point between 110:23:54, when we last see Buzz approaching the MESA without the Hasselblad (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102354.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">16 mm frame</a>), and 110:25:17, when Buzz re-appears with the Hasselblad in his right hand.

Note that Neil is working with the scoop well away from the MESA and that, at least during this camera transfer, Neil did not hand the camera to Buzz. See, also, Keith Wilson's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.5886.html" target="alsj">comments</a> on this camera transfer.
1102525|ALSJ||Buzz is about to do the Bootprint Penetration Experiment for the soil mechanics experts. He will take five photo, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#BPSE" target="alsj">AS11-40-5876 to 80</a>.
1102525|ALSJ||In the 16-mm film, the shadow of the Hasselblad lens can be seen at the left edge of the frame, with a small, sunlit portion of Buzz's suit just above it. About 16 seconds later, Buzz moves down-Sun with the camera in his right hand. He disappears from the 16-mm frame to the left, again, at about 110:25:49. At this point, he probably takes AS11-40- <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5876" target="alsj">5876</a>, which shows an undisturbed patch of soil. At about 110:26:05, his right leg comes into view as he plants his right boot deliberately on the pristine patch. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102608.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film taken at about 110:26:08 shows him with his leg extended and his boot planted. He then lifts his foot and backs out of the 16-mm field-of-view and takes two "after" pictures of the bootprint: <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5877" target="alsj">5877</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5878" target="alsj">5878</a>. He took the second of these from slightly farther away and got better focus. Erwin D'Hoore has combined them as a red-blue anaglyph (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11rb5877-8.jpg" title="red-blue stereoimage" target="alsj">1.9Mb</a>). The length of the boot is about 33 cm and its greatest width is about 15 cm.
1102700|ALSJ||At about 110:27:00 Buzz steps back into view at the left and plants his boot just beyond the previous bootprint. In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1102702.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">frame</a> from the 16-mm film taken at about 110:27:02, the first bootprint in just behind Buzz's boot. He now takes two pictures of his boot and the new print: <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5879" target="alsj">5879</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5880" target="alsj">5880</a>. The 5-cm rock next to Buzz's boot in the Hasselblad images can be picked out in the 16-mm frame. Journal Contributor John Hancock was combined 5879 and 80 to give a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11minipan5879-80Hancock.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">somewhat larger field-of-view</a>.
1102700|ALSJ||Readers should note that Buzz is following his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a> fairly closely and that the footprint photos are one of his tasks. During the 1991 mission review, he remembered that he was the one who took them.

1102720|ALSJ||Neil is going out some distance from the MESA to get material for the bulk sample, mostly in the area of the Solar Wind Collector, but also off-camera to the left.
1102720|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to not take too much time to collect that (bulk) sample but, at the same time, we wanted to minimize contamination from engine exhaust and tried to go out into areas that were, one, untrampled and, second, a little bit farther out.
1102720|ALSJ||I asked if he made any attempt to get a representative set of samples.
1102720|ALSJ|CDR|In the bulk we were just supposed to get...
1102720|ALSJ|LMP|Where was that close-up camera (Apollo Lunar Surface Close-up Camera or ALSCC)? Has that been used at this point?
1102720|ALSJ|CDR|No. We get to it at the end, (chuckling) with great reluctance. They get nervous about that one at the end, if you remember.
1102720|ALSJ||The close-up camera, shown in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5931goldcam.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> by Thomas Schwagmeier from AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5931" target="alsj">5931</a>, was also known as the Gold camera, after the Principal Investigator, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../ThomasGold1968.jpg" title="portrait" target="alsj">Dr. Thomas (Tommy) Gold</a>. Apollo 13 photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../a13/ap13-KSC-70PC-11.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">KSC-70PC-11</a> shows Fred Haise training with the Gold Camera. I asked Neil and Buzz why they were reluctant to use it.
1102720|ALSJ|CDR|Prof. Gold got his camera placed on the manifest very late and over crew objections. He hoped to support his erroneous theory of a 'cotton candy' surface. We had little enthusiasm for the intruder.
1102720|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ThomasGold1968.jpg" title="portrait" target="alsj">Thomas Gold</a> was a long-standing proponent of a theory - based in part on radio astronomical observations of the Moon - that the surface was covered with a deep layer of fine dust into which spacecraft and astronauts might sink into oblivion. Unfortunately, neither the fact that pictures of the Moon taken by the Ranger spacecraft showed small craters that would not have survived in Gold's dust sea nor the fact the Surveyor spacecraft all landed safely on very firm surfaces kept Gold from intense lobbying to get his close-up camera flown. The close-up camera was designed to take very high resolution pictures of very small surface areas and, indeed, they showed that the top millimeter or two usually had a "fairy castle structure" that would explain the radio returns. However, the scientific return from the experiment probably did not match that of the other experiments flown during Apollo.
1102720|ALSJ|CDR|The bulk sample took longer than in the simulations because the area where the bulk sample was collected was significantly farther from the MESA table than the way we had done it in <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a>. The MESA table was in deep shadow and collecting samples in that area was far less desirable than collecting them out there in the sunlight where we could see what we were doing. In addition, (by going farther from the MESA) we were farther from the exhaust plume and the contamination of propellants. So I made a number of trips back and forth in the sunlight, and then carried the sample back over to the scale where the sample bag was mounted. I probably made 20 trips back and forth from sunlight to shade. I took a lot longer, but by doing it that way, I was able to pick up both a hard rock and ground mass (soil) in almost every scoopful. I tried to choose various types of hard rocks out there so that, if we never got to the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6932235" target="alsj">documented sample</a>, at least we would have a variety of types of hard rock in the bulk sample. This was at the cost of probably double the amount of time that we normally would take for the bulk sample."
1102720|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt, Jim Gooding (NASA's Lunar Sample Curator) and others have told me that Neil did a superb job of gathering a large, representative collection of samples in a relatively short period of time. Indeed, the fact that they are so representative of the site and of mare sites in general has meant that, over the years when researchers have wanted mare samples for use in procedures that would result in sample destruction, frequently, they were given Apollo 11 samples. One example that comes easily to mind is T.D. Lin, a researcher at Construction Technology Laboratories, who was looking into the feasibility of using lunar soil in the manufacture of concrete on the Moon - a process that could greatly reduce construction costs at a lunar base. After doing a great deal of preliminary work on simulated lunar soil made by breaking up terrestrial basalt, he requested a small quantity of lunar soil for a final test. Because Neil had collected such a large quantity of representative soil, in 1986 NASA decided that it would be useful to give Lin a small amount for his experiments, knowing that there was plenty left for future work.

1102822|ALSJ||Buzz is following his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a> in making comments about the lighting. The halo around Neil's shadow is shown best in AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5930" target="alsj">5930</a>, a picture that starts a pan he takes while Buzz is off-loading the science packages from the back of the LM. Buzz is out of the TV field-of-view, off-camera to the right. At one point during the following, Neil also goes off-camera to the right, presumably to collect more material for the bulk sample.
1102822|ALSJ||On the later flights where the actual landing site was known soon after touchdown, photographs show that the surface around the LM appears to be significantly brighter than the surrounding soils. In addition, each of the last three crews climbed hillsides several kilometers from their LM's and, with long focal length lens, took pictures of the spacecraft. In these pictures, too, the ground near the LM is light in color. In his commentary on Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt suggests that, during the landing, the engine plume sweeps the surface of small particles, increasing the proportion of larger particles and, hence, the amount of reflected sunlight. In places where the soil is subsequently disturbed by footprints or Rover tracks, the original state of the soil is more or less restored and those disturbed areas appear darker against the lightened soil. In support of this contention, he notes that areas of disturbed soil well away from the LM do not appear darker.
1103147|ALSJ||Buzz is taking the first of two <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">planned</a> panoramic sequence of photos and, when Bruce asks, "Say again which strut, Buzz", he is asking Buzz which of the pans he is taking.
1103147|ALSJ|LMP|I took the first panorama out in front without having the camera mounted on the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a>, and it did not appear to be unnatural to do so. It's much easier to operate with it mounted; however, I didn't find that the weight of the camera was as much a hindrance to operation as pre-flight simulations indicated it would be. There is no doubt that having the mount frees you to operate with both hands on other tasks. The handle is adequate to perform the job of pointing the camera. I don't think we took as many inadvertent pictures as some pre-flight simulations would have indicated. It seems as though, in all the simulations where we picked up the camera, we always managed to take (unintended) pictures. I don't think that was the case in this mission as much as we thought it was going to be. We'll know if a number of pictures taken are pointed at odd angles."

1103506|ALSJ|CDR|We had individual bags for documented samples which we didn't use very much. I didn't take the boxes away from the MESA with me out when I was making collections.
1103506|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah, I think this kind of thing (in figure 101) is the kind of thing we used. That's not me in the picture (perhaps referring to figure 102), but it was something like that.
1103506|ALSJ||Neil is mistaken.

The original image is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6932243" target="alsj">S69-32243</a>. It is Buzz wielding the scoop while Neil holds a sample bag open.
1103506|ALSJ|CDR|Somehow, something doesn't seem quite right, but I can't figure out what it is. Figure <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy45.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">45</a> (showing a small scoop flown on Apollo 15) isn't it. Yeah, I think it was this one (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy40.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Figure 40</a>) or one very much like that."
1103506|ALSJ||Buzz has moved in closer to the ladder and remains there during the following discussion between Bruce and Mike. Buzz is probably still inspecting the LM.
1103709|ALSJ||The LM is actually at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LastBest.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Juliett 0.65/7.52</a>. Mike is describing a spot about 4.4 kilometers too far south. He circled the crater at E.3/7.6 and also one at E.8/7.7 on the flown copy of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#flownLAM2" target="alsj">LAM-2</a>. To the left of the crater at E.3/7.6, he wrote 'SW Rim'.
1103709|ALSJ||At about this time, Buzz moves to the northern edge of the LM shadow and partially into the sun as he continues his inspection. After a short while, he moves back into the shadow near the ladder. Neil is still at the MESA.
1103952|ALSJ||Neil leaves the MESA and joins Buzz near the ladder.
1103956|ALSJ||Had communications between the crew and Houston been unsatisfactory during the EVA, they had the option of deploying a large, umbrella-shaped S-band antenna. On Apollos 12 and 14, the S-band antenna was deployed, primarily to provide good signals from the color TV camera. However, because the deployment would have taken 20 minutes and comm was acceptable, the Apollo 11 antenna was never deployed.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|It takes a while to put that thing up.
1103956|ALSJ||Jones - "On both 12 and 14, it was basically a two-man operation getting it set up and aligned."
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|My recollection is that I always practiced doing that alone. (See NASA training photo <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#69H663" target="alsj">69-H-663</a>.) Is that right, Buzz? You were always doing something else at the time I was fiddling with that."
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|The only time I remember screwing around with that was at the factory.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|Unless we had a problem, I was expected to do it myself.
1103956|ALSJ||Jones - "What the 12 and 14 crews found was that, as you turned the crank, the thing tended to tip over and so you needed to have the other guy hold it down."
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|Was that a characteristic of the lunar gravity that made it (behave) different?
1103956|ALSJ||Jones - "I would think so. Thank you; I didn't know they were planning on doing it as a one-man operation."
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|It would probably have toppled over.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|Wise choice (not to deploy it)!
1103956|ALSJ||Buzz starts for the MESA, carrying the Hasselblad by hand.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think we noticed anything that was abnormal. I guess the only thing that I noticed that I made a note of was the jet plume deflectors. The one of the right side as I was looking at the LM - which would make it Quad 1 (outside Neil's window) - appeared to be a bit more wrinkled than the one on Quad 4 (outside Buzz's window). Of course, there's nothing to compare it with, because I'd never seen them before. As a matter of fact, the first time we really saw them was when we looked out of the Command Module and got a pretty good idea of their structure.
1103956|ALSJ||Superficial damage to the descent stage resulting from firings of the LM RCS jets was noticed during the Apollo 9, which was flown in Earth orbit from March 3 to March 13, 1969. As a result of that damage, a decision was made to install plume deflectors on Eagle, which had not yet been installed in its S-IVB adapter. The Apollo 10 LM, Snoopy, which had been installed in its adapter in January, flew without deflectors. Apollo 11 photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.44_6574hr.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS11-44-6574</a> shows Eagle in lunar orbit prior to descent and the plume deflectors under the RCS clusters on either side of the cabin are clearly visible. Apollo 10 photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as10_34_5085.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS10-34-5085</a> is a similar photo of Snoopy and, although the LM image is smaller and less distinct, a careful comparison of the two photos, particularly in the area to the right of the Commander's window, confirms that there were no deflectors on Snoopy. Finally, there is a clear statement in the Apollo 11 Mission Report that the deflectors were an addition to Eagle. My thanks to Marv Hein for bringing this little mystery to my attention, and to Mike Gentry and Linda Fisk at NASA Johnson for locating the images.
1103956|ALSJ||In August 1996, Frank O'Brien brought to my attention the following statement from an article by Robert F. Stengel, "Manual Attitude Control of the Lunar Module", which was published in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 7, No. 8, August 1970, pp. 941-947: "Tests of an early version of the Apollo 11 LGC (Lunar Guidance Computer) program uncovered an excessive on-time of the RCS thrusters during manual landing simulations. The additional RCS propellant usage was discomforting, but the primary concern was the cumulative heating of the descent stage which would be caused by exhaust impingement of the down-firing (+X) RCS thrusters. Inhibiting the +X jets for small rate errors was proposed as a solution; however, the deterioration in handling qualities was unacceptable. In simulations, pilots were forced to use large rates more often, bringing the +X jets back into use. As a result, the on-time savings were unpredictable. This was one indication that handling qualities were at the base of the problem."
1103956|ALSJ||Although Stengel does not explicitly discuss the RCS deflectors, they were probably part of the solution.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|The only abnormality I noticed - and it wasn't an abnormality - was that the insulation had been thermally damaged and broken on the secondary (horizontal) struts of the forward leg.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|This is true in the rear, also.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't carefully check every secondary strut, but the primary struts didn't seem to be damaged.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|There was a sooting or darkening or carboning; I don't know what you call it. At least, I feel it was a deposit rather than just a baking or singeing of the material.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|We have some pictures of the struts.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|The part ... I didn't notice anything peculiar about the (descent stage fuel and oxidizer) vents. There didn't seem to be anything at all deposited on the surface from any of the vents underneath or from the oxidizer (and) fuel vent(s) above.
1103956|ALSJ||As Ed Mitchell mentions in his Apollo 14 commentary following <a href = "../a14/a14.postland.html#1081549" target="alsj">108:15:49</a>, the crews vented the pressurizing helium from the descent system. None of the hypergolyic propellants were vented, to avoid contamination of the samples, the suits, or anything that would be taken back into the cabin.
1103956|ALSJ||84k has examined six vents to make sure there are no indication of fuel or oxidizer leakage. Paul Fjeld calls attention of four, fuel-only, descent engine vents at the bottom edge of the descent stage just aft of the plus-Y strut. These can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14det9255PlusYVents.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled detail</a> from Apollo 14 photo AS14-66-9255. These are the vents "underneath". Also labeled in the detail is the helium vent associated with the fuel tanks. It is pointing north (plus-Y). A similar vent associated with the oxygen tanks is in a similar position relative to the minus-Z strut, and points east. This vent can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15det11840AftHeVent.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled detail</a> from Apollo 15 photo AS15-87-11840. The two helium vents are "above" head height. For completeness, the vent for the Supercritical Helium Tank's Burst Disk is labeled in the Apollo 14 photo. Finally, Fjeld has provided a Grumman photo of Eagle ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LM5HeliumVents.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">84k</a> ) with the three descent stage vents circled in yellow, along with two on the ascent stage.
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|The most pronounced insulation damage was on the front, <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> strut. Its being in deep shadow obviated the possibility of getting a good close-up picture in that dark environment."
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|I think the best pictures we got were of the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Z</a> strut."
1103956|ALSJ|CDR|There was less damage than on the examples we looked at pre-flight. Just the very outer layers were penetrated.
1103956|ALSJ|LMP|From what I could see of the probes, they had just bent or broken at the upper attach point. I didn't observe that they had any other fractures in them. One of them - on the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> strut - was sticking almost straight up."
1104107|ALSJ||Buzz's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a> indicates that he was supposed to have taken pictures of the bulk sample area ("Photo Blk Sam Area") but, perhaps because Neil did the sampling, he is suggesting that Neil could make a better choice of shots. Neil moves in toward Buzz. Buzz has his back toward us and blocks our view of the camera exchange.
1104107|ALSJ||As Buzz moves out of the way to our left, we see Neil holding the camera in his hand, probably taking four pictures of the plaque. Note that Neil is holding the camera over the center of the footpad to get clear shots of the plaque. Syd Buxton has provided a cleaned-up version of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">a B&amp;W reproduction of the plaque</a> he found on the MSFC website.
1104107|ALSJ|CDR|We had to guess at the exposures, so I took several different exposures to try to catch the plaque.
1104107|ALSJ||Jones - "And that's frames <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#Plaque" target="alsj">5897 to 5900</a>."
1104107|ALSJ||Colin Mackellar has provided an MP4 clip from the restored video ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11v.1103952.mp4" target="alsj">2 min 13 sec, 18 Mb</a> ), along with a detail ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11v.1103952det.mp4" target="alsj">2 min 13 sec, 17 Mb</a> ) showing the crew activity near the ladder. Buzz has been holding the camera in his hand. Ulli Lotzmann provides a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5900HRPlusText.jpg" target="alsj">detail</a> from 5900 with the flag container, its attachment bracket, and the plaque cover labelled.
1104107|ALSJ||Buzz stops before he gets to the MESA.
1104125|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Bill Wood has provided a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11GDSPol.html" target="alsj">Polaroid still</a> taken at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/http://honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/goldstone/index.html" target="alsj">Goldstone</a> at about the time Buzz says ' fingers', which is roughly 110:41:48.
1104125|ALSJ||Buzz moves out of the TV field-of-view to the left.
1104149|ALSJ||As indicated in Figure 3-15 ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11prsci3-15.html" title="image" target="alsj">164 k</a> ) from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, Neil takes a couple of photographs of the bulk sample area from his present position. The two photos are AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5901" target="alsj">5901</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5902" target="alsj">5902</a>, which can be combined in a mini-pan ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan5901-2.jpg" title="mini-pan" target="alsj">1.1 Mb</a> ). The second/upper photo shows Buzz beyond the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> strut. Note the distinguishing smudges of dirt on his knees. Neil moves toward the MESA.
1104149|ALSJ||Errors in the raw transcript for the next two minutes or so of the mission may have contributed to confusion about whether or not Buzz took any pictures during the EVA. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.rawtrans.html" target="alsj">comparison</a> is provided.
1104149|ALSJ|CDR| title=image" target="alsj">Neil taking the photo</a>.
1104149|ALSJ||In 5903, Buzz has his left arm raised and is probably reading the checklist sewn on the wrist cover of his glove, as shown in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5903.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a>. See, also, a pre-flight photo of Buzz's left glove, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6938937" target="alsj">S69-38937</a>. Note the dirt smudges on Buzz's knees. Note, also, that he is moving his right foot forward and is pushing dirt with it as he goes. Neil's reflection can be seen in Buzz's visor and Journal Contributor Markus Mehring has produced a rectified <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.neil-mirror.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">close-up</a>. "I scanned the best and largest print I had available, removed the roughly 5 degree tilt that the original has in relation to the horizon, mirrored it, adjusted color in order to somewhat get rid of the golden tint of the visor, and re-projected it flat in order to kill as much spherical appearance as tolerable - hence the smear on the edges, which is impossible to avoid." In examining 5903, note that Neil was much closer to the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> footpad than he was when he took 5901 and 5902, as is indicated in Figure 3-15 ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11photomap.gif" target="alsj">196 k</a> ) from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.
1104149|ALSJ||While studying the copy of 5903 that graces the cover of the original edition of NASA SP-350, "Apollo Expeditions to the Moon", Journal Contributor Joonas Helminen noticed that there seemed to be no sign of the OPS antenna. An extended discussion is linked <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-5903history.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1104149|ALSJ||After taking 5903, Neil turns toward the MESA, perhaps removing the Hasselblad from his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> bracket as he does so. Next, he probably puts the camera down on the MESA.
1104239|ALSJ||Buzz comes into view and joins Neil at the MESA.
1104239|ALSJ||This is the Apollo Lunar Surface Close-up Camera (ALSCC). See the discussion following <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1102720" target="alsj">110:27:20</a>. The accompanying <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-nasmsuits.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photo</a> (courtesy Ken Glover), shows a training version of the Gold Camera (lower left) on display at the National Air and Space Museum along with the suits that Neil and Buzz wore on the Moon.
1104239|ALSJ|CDR|The Gold camera got added very late. It was an irritation. It was not that the crew was inflexible or anything. But, over the previous years and other flights, our history had told us that, when we added experiments or procedures very late - without the chance of having to find out how they interacted with other events on the timeline - we inevitably found ourselves in difficulty in flight as a result of those additions. So, we grew a natural reluctance to accept additional items late in the game.
1104239|ALSJ|LMP|They're saying they want this thing out now, before we deployed the EASEP?
1104239|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah. I'm sure Tommy was urging them through the Backroom.
1104239|ALSJ||Here, Buzz may be suggesting that Neil stay at the MESA and offload the close-up camera while he, Buzz, takes the Hasselblad and starts a pan from a spot north of the spacecraft, as per <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>.
1104320|ALSJ||It may be the Hasselblad.
1104333|ALSJ||When Buzz got the Hasselblad camera - either directly from Neil or by picking it up off the MESA where Neil may have put it as per his cuff checklist - he took an accidental frame. This picture is AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5904" target="alsj">5904</a>.
1104333|ALSJ||In the 16-mm record we see Buzz's shadow as he moves away from the MESA and it is clear that he has the Hasselblad at this point.
1104333|ALSJ||During the 1991 mission review, we did not realize that this camera exchange took place and, so, got confused. Incorrectly, we concluded that Buzz did not take any pictures after AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5896" title="image" target="alsj">5896</a>.
1104333|ALSJ|LMP|For all the panorama that I was supposed to be doing and I maybe was doing in here, there are damn few pictures that show up that indicate that that many were taken.
1104333|ALSJ||We recognized that frames AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#Pan3" target="alsj">5905 to 5916</a> make up a pan taken north of the spacecraft but, not realizing that Buzz had taken the camera back, decided that the camera had malfunctioned after 5904 and that the pan was taken by Neil after he finished with the Gold Camera. A more careful analysis of the dialog and the video tape strongly indicates that Buzz took the north pan and a number of subsequent pictures.
1104333|ALSJ||Buzz moves away from the MESA and, during his next transmission, stands near the north strut, possibly mounting the Hasselblad on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> bracket.
1104333|ALSJ||Neil removes the Gold camera from the MESA and takes his first picture between the MESA and the north (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a>) footpad. He then moves off to the northeast. This sequence represents a slight departure from the checklists in that Buzz was to have off-loaded the <a href="images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">ALSCC</a> before taking his second panorama.
1104333|ALSJ||The final frame of Buzz's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> pan, AS11-40-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5916" target="alsj">5916</a>, shows the back of Neil's suit and legs. Unfortunately, there is no sign of the Gold Camera in the image. Pan assembly by Brian McInall.
1104333|ALSJ||The interval between the time that Neil starts his first Gold-camera photo and the time he starts the second is about 25 seconds. In all, Neil took 17 pictures - each of them actually a stereopair.
1104503|ALSJ||Comm Break
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|The close-up camera was a stereo, three-D camera. They really wanted three-dimensional pictures of small particles. He (Gold) had no interest in the exhaust plume or anything like that. He was interested in the character of the lunar soil. I think he was really looking for a defense of his cotton-candy-surface theory. I think I was just looking for different kinds of surface contours. If that's what I was doing there. My recollection was that I did it rather later in the EVA. But, it could be (here).
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|The stereo camera worked fine. We had no problems with it; however, it was hard to operate. I found that the angle that I had to put my hand on the handle to pull (the trigger) and the force that it took was excessive...I found my hand getting tired very soon while taking pictures with that camera. It was wearing out my grip.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|Would you say that the angle was too horizontal?
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|Yes.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|You would like to have had it sloped down more towards you.
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|Yes. It was requiring the wrist to be cocked down.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|The initial opening up or deploying of it went quite smoothly. The extension of the handle and the opening up of the case was quite well engineered. Separating the cover, taking it off, cutting the film, and removing the cassette also went quite smoothly. I think that the big area for re-engineering might be just a change in the angle that the handle comes out. We might have to add a hinge or something like that to it. What about the height of the handle? That would probably not be too bad.
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|I think that probably was reasonable. The other problem we had with the camera is that it was falling over all the time. I think this was the result of a little bit of difficulty in figuring out the local vertical.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|Yes.
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|You'd set it down and think it was level; but apparently it wasn't because, the next time you looked, it would be laying over on its side. Or you would bump it inadvertently while you were looking somewhere else and knock it over. I picked it up three different times off the surface and it's a major effort to get down to the surface to pick the thing up.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|How'd you do that? By going down on the knee?
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|On one occasion I got it with the knee, one time I got it with the tongs, and the last time I had something else in my hand like a scoop or something that I could lean on and go down and get it. In general, there were a lot of times that I wanted to get down closer to the surface for one reason or another. I wanted to get my hand down to the surface to pick up something. This was one thing that restricted us more than we'd like. We really didn't have complete clearance to go put our knees on the surface any time we wanted. We thought the suit was qualified to do that in an emergency, but it wasn't planned as a normal operation.
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't let ourselves settle on our knees a lot of the times to get our hand on the surface. Now I think that is one thing that should be done more on future flights. We should clear that suit so that you could go down to your knees, and we should work more on being able to do things on the surface with your hands. That will make our time a lot more productive, and we will be less concerned about little inadvertent things that happen.
1104503|ALSJ|LMP|Now we can say that we have the confidence to know that we could get back up from the surface. You might have to put your hand down into all this. The thing that discouraged me was the powdery nature of the surface and the way that it adhered to everything. I didn't see any real need in getting down. I had no concern about doing it. But I agree. I think if we need something on the suit to qualify it to do this, then we ought to go ahead and do that. If it doesn't, if it just requires looking at the suits that we brought back and saying that they're qualified for kneeling, we ought to do that.
1104503|ALSJ|CDR|If you have a grip on something like a scoop, or a stick to hold on, then there's no problem at all in getting back up. You can go right down and just push on your hand and push yourself right back up. It was easy the one time I did it with the scoop in my hand. That's one thing that we hadn't done a lot in our simulations, and it would be a help, I think.
1104503|ALSJ||Astronauts on later mission found that, if they fell, they could get up relatively easily by getting on their hands and knees and then pushing back with their hands until their center of mass had rotated over their feet, at which point they could stand with the help of the internal pressure of the suit.
1104507|ALSJ||After finishing the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> pan, Buzz will take some more pictures of the spacecraft. However, during the 1991 mission review, we thought it was Neil who took those pictures, a conclusion influenced, in part, by Neil's statement at 110:46:36 and others that follow.
1104718|ALSJ||Buzz comes back to the LM near the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> (north) strut and takes AS11-40-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#LMInspect2" target="alsj">5917 and 5918</a>, which are both close-ups of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> footpad. Journal Contributor Ken MacTaggart has noticed that the apparent, triangular-shaped imprint next to the footpad in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5917" target="alsj">5917</a> can also be seen in Neil's full-length portrait of Buzz, AS11-40-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5903" target="alsj">5903</a>. Journal Contributor Haig Ensanian suggests that the imprint was made by the crinkled covering of the sides and bottom of the footpad. See a discussion linked <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PlusYPadImprint.html" target="alsj">here</a>.
1104805|ALSJ||AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#LMInspect2" target="alsj">5919</a> is a picture of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> strut, and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5920" target="alsj">5920</a> is a picture of the strut from the east. Frame <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5921" target="alsj">5921</a> is a picture under the Descent Stage while <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5922" target="alsj">5922</a> shows the cluster of thrusters between <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Z</a>. Buzz has moved out of the TV field-of-view to the left.
1104805|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0L12WjQ4co" target="alsj">Part 3</a> of Mark Gray's April 2013 YouTube release of the restored video alongside the synched 16-mm film starts at 110:49:52, 34 seconds before Buzz's next transmission.
1104906|ALSJ||Buzz moves south of the ladder, but not out of the LM shadow.
1105026|ALSJ||The idea was to point the camera up at the Earth and Buzz isn't sure that it is possible to do so. Certainly, with the Earth nearly overhead, Buzz had to take the camera off the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> bracket and then either guess at the pointing or lean far enough back that he could hold the camera over his head and sight along it. Because of the stiffness of the suit, it was very difficult to lean far enough back. One puzzling aspect of these pictures is the fact that, during the 1991 mission review, Neil said that it was he that took the Earth pictures. One possible explanation of this memory is that Buzz took the camera off, decided that he couldn't get the pictures, and then Neil took the camera for a moment, took frames AS11-40-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5923" title="image" target="alsj">5923</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5924" target="alsj">5924</a>, and then gave the camera back to Buzz. Another possibility is that Neil is mistaken about having taken Earth pictures during the EVA. Certainly, after the EVA at about 112:20, he took pictures of Earth through the overhead rendezvous window - these pictures are AS11-37-5506 to 5509 - and, twenty years after the fact, he may have gotten the memories mixed up. After reading a draft of the discussion in 1995, Neil said he had nothing more to add to the solution of this minor mystery.
1105026|ALSJ||In the Earth images, Australia is in sunlight on the left. Compare these images with a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11earth0423UT.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Starry Night view of Earth</a> from Tranquility Base at 110:51.
1105026|ALSJ||Just prior to Buzz's next transmission, an astronaut comes into view near the east footpad. The picture is very grainy, but it appears to be Neil, still using the close-up camera. This astronaut goes out of the TV field-of-view after a few seconds and then, after a few more seconds, an astronaut - this time, probably Buzz - comes into the field-of-view.
1105129|ALSJ||AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#MinusZ" target="alsj">5925 and 5926</a> are pictures of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Z</a> strut and footpad. Buzz took one picture, then stepped to his left and took another to give a stereo effect. Other crews will use this technique repeatedly as they document geology samples prior to collection.
1105129|ALSJ||The SEQ Bay in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11quads.jpg" title="mage" target="alsj">LM Quad II</a> holds the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP).
1105129|ALSJ||Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/ap11-S69-18994.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">S69-18994</a> shows Astronaut Don Lind during a trial deployment on 21 January 1969.
1105129|ALSJ||At this point in the TV record, we see Buzz hand the Hasselblad camera to Neil, who has just come back into the TV picture. Buzz's next task is to off-load the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">EASEP</a> (Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package) while Neil takes documentation photos of the off-load.
1105247|ALSJ||As noted by Journal Contributor Markus Mehring, at the end of Buzz's transmission, we see him working at the SEQ Bay and discarding something to his right, which ends up next to the minus-Z (east) strut, as can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5927.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5927" target="alsj">5927</a>. Contributor Paul Fjeld writes that the discarded object is "a small sheet of 5-mil (0.005 inches or 0.127 mm), aluminized kapton with two little handles that covered the door-deployment tapes. In 5927, you can see the tapes coming out of the SEQ bay structure nearest the -Z gear."
1105247|ALSJ||There was a similar 5-mil sheet that covered the S-band deployable antenna on Quad 1. The new scans of mag S (from original film in 2004) show the detail of the Quad 1 installation really well. (See a <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5864label.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled detail from 5864</a> provided by Journal Contributor Thomas Schwagmeier.) You can see a single handle on the left-bottom part of the quad near the downlock latch shield (little white rectangle) and I can even convince myself that I can make out the little 'fingers' that held the blanket on (with tape to hold them). The astronaut yanked the handle(s) revealing deployment lanyards velcroed inside which pulled out the two 'Antenna Release Pins', the label of which we can now read thanks to Kipp's good work. I re-did the LM-13 blanket at the Cradle Museum after I saw those shots (thanks Kipp!)."
1105257|ALSJ||Neil bobs briefly to one knee. During the 1991 mission review, we considered the possibility that Neil was taking pictures - either of the Earth or Hasselblad close-ups of the east footpad. However, at that time none of us realized that, at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mobility.html#1105129">110:51:29</a>, Buzz had said that he was taking a stereopair just before giving the Hasselblad to Neil. It is very difficult to pick Buzz's words out of the static but I now have no doubt about the statement or about the conclusion that Buzz took AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#MinusZ" target="alsj">5925 and 5926</a>. Because frame <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5927" target="alsj">5927</a> is a picture of Buzz off-loading the EASEP, I conclude that Neil is probably going to one knee to pick something up off the ground, possibly the Gold camera as he says in the section of the Technical Debrief reproduced after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.mobility.html#1104503">110:45:03</a>.
1105257|ALSJ||Neil moves behind the LM to take pictures of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">EASEP off-load</a>. Buzz comes into view as he pulls a tape which raises the horizontally-hinged, main door. There is a smaller, vertically hinged door on the left, which he opened first. Diagrams on <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../SEQdoors.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 58</a> of Scott Sullivan's </i>Virtual LM<i> illustrate the way the door is hinged. Additonal details can be found on pages 38 to 47.
1105338|ALSJ|LMP|Taking the cover off the lanyard (tape) was very easy. It pulled away and didn't seem to have any thermal or blast effects on it. Underneath the EASEP, the (landing) radar looked like it came through without any heat damage that I could tell. When (the doors) folded out, (they) went up even easier than the trainer. As the top door folded back, it didn't seem to fall into a detent and I tugged on it a couple of times. It looked like it was going to stay up there without any tendency to come back down again.
1105338|ALSJ||Neil's first two pictures of Buzz preparing to offload the passive seismometer from the lefthand compartment of the SEQ Bay are AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPOffload" target="alsj">5927 and 5928</a>.
1105338|ALSJ||The next frame, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5929" target="alsj">5929</a>, shows Buzz draping a tape over the lefthand SEQ Bay door.
1105338|ALSJ||That is, pick an area to deploy the scientific gear.
1105338|ALSJ||Comm Break
1105530|ALSJ||Neil comes into view to the left of the spacecraft and puts the Gold camera down, out of the way. He then turns to face Buzz who is removing the seismometer from the SEQ Bay. We can see Buzz's feet and legs under the spacecraft, beyond the left edge of the descent engine bell.
1105549|ALSJ||The experiment packages were attached to a boom-mounted rail and Buzz had the option of using tapes to slide the packages out of the SEQ Bay and then lower them to the surface. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">Training</a> photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#69H675" target="alsj">69-H-675</a> shows Buzz using the tapes to get the LRRR out of the righthand compartment.
1105549|ALSJ|LMP|In an effort to save some time, I elected to deploy both packages manually. I pulled the seismometer a few inches, disengaged the hook, disconnected it from the top, and slid it out. I was unable to toss the lanyard over the side door to keep it out of the way, so it did come down from the boom and had a tendency to get in the way. The package itself was quite easy to manage. I had my left hand on the handle and moved the right hand around to support the weight as it slid off the rails. It was disengaged quite easily from the boom at the pip pin. I had it down on the surface; and, then, to get ample maneuvering room to get the retro-reflector down, I decided that I wanted to move the seismometer away. However, there happened to be a small crater right there, so I had to move it (the seismometer) maybe 10 feet away and come back. Remember, it didn't seem to be a good place to set that seismometer down, other than right in front. It appeared to be in my way a little bit.
1105549|ALSJ||Neil's photo AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5929" target="alsj">5929</a> shows Buzz removing the seismometer from the SEQ Bay.
1105549|ALSJ||As can be seen at the left edge of the TV frame, after taking Buzz's picture, Neil takes a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan1105549.html" target="alsj">pan</a>, turning clockwise between images, as indicated in his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>.
1105630|ALSJ||The LR-cubed is the Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector or LRRR, which will give experimenters on Earth a means of accurately measuring the distance between their telescopes and the LR-cubed. A series of distance measurements will yield important information about the Moon's motions, will provide tests of the theory of General Relativity, and will even provide information on internal motions in the Earth and Moon. LRRRs were also deployed by the Apollo 14 and 15 crews. As of February 2005, the retroreflectors were still being used in conjunction with a <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/mlrs/" target="alsj">dedicated facility</a> at the McDonald Observatory in Texas. In March 2005, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory Team announced that the array of retroreflectors - including a French array landed on the Soviet Lunokhod 2 rover - had been used to confirm Einstein's Strong Equivalence Principle (that all types of matter accelerate at the same rate in a gravitational field) to twice the accuracy previously achieved by any method and the time-invariance of Newton's gravitational constant to ten times previous accuracy.
1105630|ALSJ|LMP|In pulling out the laser package, I used the same technique, pulling out a few inches, then disconnecting the lanyard from the package itself, then pulling the string that was attached to the pip pin. In <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training sessions</a>, I had pulled this one rather slowly and firmly and had a few problems with the pip pin binding. The recommendation was to give it a fairly good jerk. When I did this, the wire ring that attached the cord itself to the pip pin sprung open. Either it was a welded joint that separated, or thermal effects somehow weakened it; but it opened up and came loose from the pin. I was able to get the pin out by depressing the one side. Then by pushing it with my right hand and pushing it through, it came loose. Then I lowered it down to the surface and, again, it was quite easy to handle."
1105630|ALSJ|CDR|I say that I'm at about the LM 7:30 position, and this is the LM 7:30 position here in photograph (AS11-40-<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5931" target="alsj">5931</a>). So it appears as though the panorama to which I am addressing at 57:05 was the panorama which started with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5930" target="alsj">5930</a> and went through maybe <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5941" target="alsj">5941</a>."
1105630|ALSJ||After finishing the pan, Neil goes over to the Gold camera and picks it up so that he can take it out to the EASEP deployment site.
1105630|ALSJ||Buzz has closed the doors to keep out sunlight which, otherwise, would heat the interior of the Descent Stage.
1105630|ALSJ|LMP|The boom slid back in with no problem. I left the lanyards dangling out the bottom, pulled the (door) retract lanyards, and the doors came back down and fitted together very nicely. The whole operation was quite smooth and I thought we got a little bit ahead in time in the deployment of these things.
1105750|ALSJ|LMP|I picked up the two packages and we headed out to the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> strut looking for a relatively level area."
1105816|ALSJ||Buzz is coming into view past the right edge of the LM. Neil's picture of Buzz carrying the EASEP past this crater is AS11-40- <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5942</a>.
1105824|ALSJ||AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5943</a> shows the rounded boulders. After taking 5943, Neil steps to his left to get a stereo companion, which is <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5944</a>. He may have taken a Hasselblad stereopair to document the location of the boulders.
1105850|ALSJ|LMP|Looking for level areas, I found it difficult in looking down at the surface and saying exactly what was level. I don't know what to attribute this to, particularly. You don't have as good a horizon definition as on the Earth. When you look out to the side, you've got a very flat area on the Moon. When you look out to the edges, you've got varying slopes. I think it's further compounded by the fact that, with one-sixth g and a center of mass displaced considerably aft and up from where it normally is (because of the backpack), your physical cues of supporting your weight are different. The result was that it was just a little bit difficult to tell what was level and what was sloping, either to one side or up and down.
1105850|ALSJ|CDR|You don't have as strong a gravity indication either, I don't think.
1105850|ALSJ|LMP|Yes. It doesn't have as firm an orientation.
1105855|ALSJ||As Buzz moves off-camera to the right, Neil comes into view beyond the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> strut. He is carrying the close-up camera out in front. When he gets to the boulders Buzz mentioned at 110:58:24, he stops briefly, probably to examine with the eye of a well-trained geologic observer, but doesn't appear to use the Gold Camera.
1105855|ALSJ|CDR|There was some discussion about the possibility of moving the television position during this sequence; and the conclusion, as I remember it, was that you didn't gain that much and it took time. Initially we had a number of positions that were candidate positions for the TV tripod and, at some point in time, it was concluded that just finding one position that would get the majority of the action was probably the best conclusion.
1105912|ALSJ||In the TV record, during his next transmission Neil stops about 2-3 meters past the place where Buzz was at 110:58:24 when he mentioned the boulders. Here, Neil may use the Apollo Lunar Surface Close-up Camera (ALSCC or Gold Camera) to take some images of boulder surfaces, possibly AS11-45-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#6709" target="alsj">6709 and 10</a>. He may also take 6712 in the same area, apparently a close-up image of a small, rounded rock. The close-up camera images are 3 inches (7.6 cm) across, so the visible dimensions of the rounded rock in 6712 are about 2 by 2.5 inches (5 by 6.4 cm). For some unknown reason, there is no image numbered 6711.
1105928|ALSJ||At about this time, Neil takes AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5945</a>, which shows Buzz just after he put the LR-cubed down on the surface and moved off to the left with the seismometer.
1105928|ALSJ||Neil moves toward Buzz and then stops for about 16 seconds at the edge of the TV field-of-view. His next comment comes as he moves out of the field-of-view and suggests that he was examining another boulder. We know from the Hasselblad images he took to document the EASEP deployment that, while he was deploying the LR-Cube and taking the documentation photos, he left the close-up camera standing upright on a boulder about 2 meters northeast of the LR-Cubed and, therefore, just out of the TV field-of-view. This suggests the strong possibility that this boulder is the subject of the final close-up camera images, AS11-45-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#6713" target="alsj">6713 and 14</a>.
1105928|ALSJ||The best visualization we have of the landing site is probably Vlad Pustynskis 2010-1 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11photomapVP120124.pdf" target=new">photogrammetric map</a> and the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Photogrammetry.html" target=new">accompanying analysis</a>. The map shows that the LRRR is 60 feet (18 meters) from the center of the minus-Y (southern) foot pad; and that the PSE is about 80 feet (24 meters).
1110001|ALSJ||These are the "zap-pits" of later missions. They are, indeed, tiny craters formed by the impact of micrometeorites. ALSCC image <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#6713" target="alsj">6713</a> contains a prominent example at the upper right while <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#6709" target="alsj">6709</a> contains several smaller examples, including one immediately below the white inclusion. At 111:22:34, Neil will recognize and collect samples of genuinely vesicular basalt.

1110001|ALSJ||The checklists indicate that, while <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">Buzz</a> deploys the seismometer, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">Neil</a> will deploy the EASEP or, more accurately, the laser reflector and take photos of both deployments.
1110249|ALSJ||Comm Break
1110249|ALSJ||AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5946</a> is a picture of Buzz as he uses a handle on the seismometer to try to get the experiment leveled and aligned. In order to level the seismometer, he simply moves it around on the uneven surface, pushing dirt aside when necessary, until the small ball (BB) is centered in the cup that holds it. To get proper alignment, he makes sure that the shadow cast by a small gnomon on the top of the package falls on a predetermined mark. See, also, a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PSEP_NASM.jpg" title="line drawing" target="alsj">labelled drawing</a> with dimensions provided by Allan Needell of the National Air and Space Museum.
1110249|ALSJ|LMP|In going through the numbers of pulling the little lanyards, everything progressed as neat as can be. The handle deployed upward and rotated around, even though I wasn't able to see it fit into its slot. This is the maneuvering handle on the PSEP (Passive Seismic Experiment Package). I might point out that the flight article was different in configuration than the training package, the difference being that you couldn't see when the handle was out and locked in its detent as well on the flight package as you could on the training package. Anyway, this worked out quite well. Orienting the package in azimuth was quite easy. The shadow of the gnomon stood out quite well in our session in the lab with the flight packages. We had had some concern as to just how well this shadow was going to stand out against this silver surface. However, all three of the pins in the gnomon were quite clear. I won't say they were a very crisp shadow, as there was a little bit of fuzziness to them (because of the finite size of the solar disk), but it was quite easy to determine where the center of it was and get it oriented at the 45-degree mark.
1110249|ALSJ|LMP|The big problem arose in trying to get the BB to settle down into the center of its little cup. It seemed to want to find a home away from me at about 11 o'clock as I faced the package. I would try to push it (the package) down to get it (the BB) to rotate around, and it would move away from this position and start spinning around the outside. Try as I would to move it gradually away or push down on the package - away from where the bubble was - to get it to drift across, I was completely unsuccessful in getting the BB to find a home anywhere but along the perimeter.
1110249|ALSJ||Note that the two instruments have different level indicators. On later missions, all of the instruments will have level bubbles.
1110249|ALSJ|CDR|(If there was an antenna) it would have been on the seismic experiment. The LR-Cubed had no power in it. It had a gnomon and a bubble. The PSE had a BB and it had different alignment requirements.
1110249|ALSJ||Mark Gray has <a href="https://vimeo.com/208068909" target="alsj">posted</a> a 29 April 1969 Bendix film showing technicians checking the Apollo 11 LR-Cubed and packing it for shipment to the Cape. Thanks to Colin Mackellar for alerting the Project Apollo Yahoo News Group.
1110416|ALSJ|CDR|It would have been nice to have a big rock table to set those packages on, but there wasn't any. The area where they were placed was a ridge between some shallow craters. I think we have reasonably good pictures of those ridges. They have this same kind of soil consistency as the surrounding area. The packages were in essentially soft material which allowed us to jiggle them down and get them reasonably well set into the sand, but there is no knowing whether they will stay there for a long period of time or might slowly settle.
1110416|ALSJ|LMP|I think that they retained their present position pretty well. When I decided that I wanted to change the slope of the package one way or another, I found that I had difficulty in getting it to sink down a little more on one side. Even by scraping it back and forth, I couldn't seem to lower one edge as much as I would have liked to have.
1110416|ALSJ||That is, it is domed upward, rather than forming a bowl.
1110456|ALSJ||Neil's next photo, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5946HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5946</a>, shows Buzz still trying to level the seismometer. Note that neither of the solar panels has deployed. Neil's footprints pass relataively near the seismometer on the left. His next photo, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5947</a>, which shows one of the solar panels open and, so, hasn't been taken yet, doesn't show any additional footprints, indicating that Neil looked at the BB before taking 5946. See, also, a labelled drawing of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PSEP_NASM.jpg" title="line drawing" target="alsj">PSEP</a>.
1110456|ALSJ|LMP|As I would bend down and look at this thing, it just appeared that this cup - instead of being concave - had somehow changed its shape and was convex. It didn't appear that there was any hope of the BB ever being anywhere but along the edge, so I visually tried to level it as best I could. As I indicated before, that wasn't easy to do with any degree of confidence.
1110620|ALSJ||Neil may have taken AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5947HR.jpg" title="new" target="alsj">5947</a> at this point.
1110634|ALSJ|LMP|One of the two retaining structures that should have fallen away when you right the package - both should fall down, exposing the panels - failed. So I walked around the package and easily reached down with my finger and flicked it loose. It didn't require much force at all. When I deployed the panels, the left one came out and deployed completely; then, following another pull on the lanyard, the right one deployed. There was a certain amount of rocking motion and dancing around on the surface and the two deployed panels flung themselves around before finally settling down. During the process of doing this, I believe two of the four corners came in contact with the surface and picked up a light coating of surface material. I'd say that the triangle that was coated might have been 2 inches on one side and maybe one inch on the other - a very small triangle. So I don't think there was much (thermal) degradation at all on the surfaces with the particular coating. I made one final inspection and then I left it.
1110634|ALSJ||After Buzz gets both solar panels deployed, Neil takes AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5948 to 5951</a> to document the seismometer deployment.
1110634|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that, in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11face5951.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail from 5951</a>, we see Buzz's face and suggests that he is looking over at Neil.
1110710|ALSJ||Buzz appears at the right of the TV picture, running easily. He stops after a short distance and turns to look back at the seismometer to check on antenna pointing.
1110740|ALSJ||Buzz heads back to the seismometer and stops with just the back of his PLSS on the edge of the TV image.
1110740|ALSJ|LMP|I made one final inspection and, when I left it, the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#BB" target="alsj">BB</a> was still sitting on the edge."
1110740|ALSJ||By this time, Neil is probably taken a documentation photo of the LR-cubed, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#EASEPDeploy" target="alsj">5952</a>. Note the close-up stereocamera perched on a rock in the background.
1110740|ALSJ||Buzz appears at the right edge of the TV picture, headed for the MESA to open the second rock box to receive the documented samples they are planning to collect.
1110943|ALSJ||Neil's picture of the PSE BB is AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5953HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5953</a>. in 2011, in an effort to locate the level indicator, Allan Needell at the National Air and Space Museum examined the Qual Unit in the Apollo 11 display and took a number of photographs. These show that the BB level indicator is on the top of the seismometer can. In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11BB5953.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">comparison</a> between 5953 and one of Needell's photos, note that the middle of the three gnomon posts (or stumps, to use the appropriate cricket term) ends just above BB-cup's cover and points at the center of the cup. See, slso, a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PSEP1-26-2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">full-resolution version</a> of Needell's photo.
1111000|ALSJ||In the Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Operations Plan, about 30 minutes was allocated to the documented sampling activity. Documented sampling was planned as a two-man activity, starting with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">Buzz</a> hammering a core tube into the surface while <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">Neil</a> took pictures of him. Then they would move on to the collection of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#69H668" target="alsj">individual rock samples</a> which they would photograph in place and then <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6932243" target="alsj">put into individual sample bags</a>. Then they would seal some soil in special "environment sample" containers, which were vacuum-sealed cans which, when placed inside the vacuum-sealed rock box, would provide double protection for any easily volatilized constituents. Finally, if time permitted, they would collect a second core tube sample before starting the EVA closeout.
1111000|ALSJ|LMP|We were obviously running out of time at the end of the EASEP deployment. We had a limited amount of time to conduct the documented sample. A figure of 10 minutes was used. I thought we might actually progress in a formal excursion and get something started anyway. (However), as the (rock)box was opened, we got the report that they wanted two core tubes, and it looked like that was probably going to take most of the time. While I proceeded to that - because that's essentially a one-man operation - Neil went around the backside of the LM and picked up what rocks he could identify, getting as wide a variety as possible.
1111000|ALSJ||Buzz goes to the MESA. Neil won't start his sampling activities until after he makes a brief trip out to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="alsj">Little West Crater</a>, and then helps Buzz with the core tubes.
1111000|ALSJ|LMP|In unpacking the box with the core tubes, I was quite careful to try to identify where the caps were. In some simulations, we had misplaced them, or they had dropped to the surface. I do think we need a better way of identifying the various packages that have this (woven metallic) packing material wrapped around them, so that, at a glance, you'd know what is inside a certain roll. In many cases, there is nothing in it (because the roll is acting as a space filler to keep the other rolls from moving around). In other cases, it's got an environmental container in it, or it's got the caps to the core tubes.
1111000|ALSJ||Because of the shortage of time, no environmental samples will be collected on Apollo 11.
1111049|ALSJ||Neil appears at the right edge of the TV picture. Initially we only see the back of his PLSS. He is likely to be grabbing the Gold Camera (ALSCC), which he left upright on a boulder about 3 meters northeast of the LRRR and just off-screen to the right in the TV view. As he starts moving again and comes fully into view, he is turning to his right with the ALSCC in his trailing left hand. He then heads east toward the 30 meter-diameter crater - now known as <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="alsj">Little West Crater</a> - that is 60 meters east of the LM. He will take a pan from the rim.
1111049|ALSJ||Neil's run across the TV picture takes about 22 seconds. In a labeled <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-091001crop3xlbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from the 01 October 2009 LROC image of the site - with the approximate TV field-of-view indicated - the distance he covered in this time is about 22 meters. His running speed is, therefore, about 3.6 km/hr. Considering how little opportunity Neil and Buzz have had to acquire running skills, Neil's speed is quite respectable. Later crews regularly achieved speeds of over 5 km/hr over distances of up to 300 meters. As Neil re-emerges from behind the LM, we can see sunlight scattered off the fans of dirt that he kicks out ahead with his feet. Neil is using a loping, foot-to-foot stride.
1111049|ALSJ|CDR|I had the documented sample to do. I was running out of time and I wanted to get those pictures (of Little West Crater). So I was hustling.
1111209|ALSJ||Comm Break
1111209|ALSJ||Buzz is still at the MESA and may be attaching one of the core tubes to an extension handle. The extension handle will allow him to hammer the core tube into the ground without having to bend over very far. The extension handle and attached core tube can be seen in training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6931206" target="alsj">S69-31206</a>.
1111209|ALSJ|LMP|In putting the extension handle on the core tube, the first one went on fairly cleanly and locked into position with a fairly high degree of confidence that it was not going to come out. I won't say that there was complete certainty that they were not going to come apart.
1111209|ALSJ||The locking collars on the extension handles generally worked without problem on all the Apollo missions. The exception was on Apollo 17 when, during the third EVA, the collars became sufficiently fouled with dust that they didn't seat properly and, during the drive back to the LM, both the scoop and the rake fell off their respective extension handles.
1111231|ALSJ||Comm Break
1111231|ALSJ||The seismic experiment is picking up their foot steps.
1111231|ALSJ||Three minutes and fifteen seconds after he started his run out to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="alsj">Little West Crater</a>, Neil reappears at the left edge of the TV picture, running quickly. While at Little West, he took a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan1111231.html" target="alsj">partial pan</a>.
1111231|ALSJ|CDR|(Looking at the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan1111231.html" target="alsj">pan</a> frames) At that large crater, that's the Gold camera (in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5954" target="alsj">5954</a>). So I was apparently carrying that little dude everywhere I went. (Chuckling) No wonder I was tired of it."
1111231|ALSJ||We don't know if Neil purposefully took 5957 and 5958 as a stereopair but, between the frames he did step to his right. Ulli Lotzmann has combined portions of the two photos as a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11rb5957-8.jpg" title="stereoimage" target="alsj">red-blue anaglyph</a> and Eric Nelson has produced an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11rb5957-8ecn.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">alternate version</a> with greater emphasis on vertical relief.
1111231|ALSJ||On the way back to the LM, Neil stopped and took <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5962" target="alsj">5962</a>.
1111231|ALSJ||Neil's mini-expedition to the Little West Crater and back took 3 minutes 15 seconds and covered about 120 meters. If we assume that he maintained the 3.6 km/hr pace estimated for the start of the run, the actual trip out and back took about 2 minutes, leaving about 1minute 15 seconds for the pictures - not an unreasonable estimate.
1111231|ALSJ|CDR|I went the farthest. While Buzz was returning from the EASEP, I went back to a big crater behind us. It was a crater that I'd estimate to be 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep. I went back to take some pictures of that ; it was between 200 and 300 feet from the LM. I ran there and ran back because I didn't want to spend much time doing that , but it was no trouble to make that kind of a trek - a couple of hundred feet or so. It just took a few minutes to lope back there, take those pictures, and then come back.
1111231|ALSJ||To get an idea of how close Neil and Buzz stayed to the LM, I thought it might be useful to overlay a sketch version of Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psrf3-16.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">3-16</a> from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a> onto a drawing of a baseball diamond. My attempt was of very poor quality. Thomas Schwagmeier came to the rescue and produced a high-quality realization. Neil's trip to Little West Crater was equivalent to a stroll from the pitcher's mound into short centerfield and back. Joe O'Dea suggested that a comparison with a football (soccer) pitch would be of greater interest to readers outside North America and Japan, and Thomas quickly turned Joe's idea into reality. Both comparisons can be found in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#a11 baseball" target="alsj">Image Library</a>.
1111231|ALSJ||About the time that Neil gets back to the LM, and as he makes his way around the south side of the spacecraft, Buzz moves away from the MESA carrying the first core tube out to a spot near the solar wind collector. Buzz pushes the core tube a few inches into the ground and starts hitting the top of the extension handle with the hammer. At first, he raises the hammer only to about chest height - the top of the extension handle is at about his waist height - and eventually to head height, swinging down sharply with each blow.
1111522|ALSJ||A poor design choice is causing the soil to compact as it enters the tube. The surface soil is very soft but, below about 4 inches, it is quite compact, having been shaken repeatedly by impacts. Consequently, Buzz meets stiff mechanical resistance to his hammering below about 4 inches and can drive the tube in no deeper. There is a further discussion of the core tube design at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1144127">114:41:27</a>. For his final strokes, Buzz is raising his hand to helmet height.
1111522|ALSJ|LMP|They weren't large, sweeping strokes, but they had a lot of energy in them and it didn't seem to be effective.
1111522|ALSJ||While Buzz is talking to Houston about the difficulty he was having driving the core tube, Neil takes AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#Core" target="alsj">5963 and 5964</a> from near the MESA.
1111522|ALSJ|LMP|I picked up the hammer, went out in the vicinity of where the solar wind experiment was, and drove the first core tube into the ground. I pushed it in about 3 or 4 inches and then started tapping it with the hammer. I found that wasn't doing much at all in the way of making it penetrate further. I started beating on it harder and harder, and I managed to get it into the ground maybe 2 inches more. I found that, when I would hit it as hard as I could and let my hand that was steadying the tube release it, the tube appeared as though it were going to fall over. It didn't stay where it had been pounded in. This made it harder, because you couldn't back off and really let it have it. I don't know if we have any way of measuring the exact force or impact that was applied - other than subjective. Maybe watching television would be some help. I was hammering it in about as hard as I felt I could safely do it. Unfortunately, we don't have any of the surfaces on the extension handle back to look at the impact. (The extension handle was not brought back to Earth for damage analysis that would indicate how hard Buzz was hitting it.) I was hitting it with the hammer to the point that I was putting significant dents in the top of it.
1111522|ALSJ||Buzz removes the core from the ground while Neil watches. Based on his comments at 114:42:59, his following statement refers to the appearance of the soil in the bottom of the tube.
1111522|ALSJ||Buzz rotates toward Neil, who can then see the bit end of the core tube and the dirt inside.
1111539|ALSJ||Buzz goes toward the MESA so that they can remove the extension handle and then put caps on the core tube prior to stowing it in the second rock box.
1111539|ALSJ|LMP|I didn't find any resistance at all in retracting the core tube. It came up quite easily. On rotating it up to the inverted position to keep anything from coming out, I didn't find any tendency at all for the material to come out of the core tube. When I unscrewed the cutter (that is, the bit) the surface seemed to separate again without any tendency for the material to flow or move. This meant that the consistency of this material (from 4 to 6 inches down), even though it looked to be about the same, was a good bit different. If I had some very close surface material and shifted it a little (with his boot), it would tend to move from one side to the other. At the bottom of the core tube, I had the distinct impression - and it's just a descriptive phrase - that this was moist material. It was adhering or had the cohesive property that wet sand would have. Once it was separated from the cutter, there was no tendency at all for it to flake or to flow.
1111539|ALSJ||As evidenced by the footprint photos, such as AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5878" target="alsj">5878</a>, the surface soil also becomes very cohesive when it is compressed.
1111539|ALSJ||Buzz approaches the MESA with the core tube in his left hand. The extensiton handle is still attached. He has the hammer in his right hand.
1111557|ALSJ||Neil kicks backwards with his right foot.
1111557|ALSJ||Neil turns about half a clockwise turn.
1111557|ALSJ||In a clip from the restored video, we see Buzz bend his right knee enough that he can use the extension handle to flick the cable off Neil's boot.
1111557|ALSJ||Buzz is at the right, shadowed end of the MESA.
1111557|ALSJ||Buzz goes off-camera to the left, carrying the second core tube. Neil is at the MESA and is probably capping the first core tube.
1111557|ALSJ||Bruce asks the Science Backroom for an answer but, receiving none and recognizing how little time remains, answers Buzz himself.
1111557|ALSJ||Buzz rejoins Neil at the MESA, carrying the second core tube.
1111557|ALSJ|LMP|I went out to another area I would judge 10 - maybe 15 - feet away. I encountered about the same difficulty in driving the tube in. I imagine it went in about the same depth. It struck me that, when I was removing this core tube from the extension handle, it was coming off (that is, that it hadn't been securely locked). I had less confidence in initially putting the two together that they were going to stay together properly. When I was removing it, it appeared as though the end of the core tube that attaches to the extension handle had a tendency to come off. I had noted this earlier in some of the bench checks (during <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11CrewTraining.html" target="alsj">training</a>). When you screw the core tube in, if you aren't careful when you disengage it, you're liable to disengage the cap on the other end. And the reason I'm belaboring this particular point is that I understand that one of the ends did come off. I guess I can't be sure that it did not come off at the time of disengaging (from the extension handle). Perhaps it could have come off in the box, but I don't believe they found the other end. So the assumption is that, when it was taken off the extension handle, the other end came off with it. It doesn't appear as though the material spread around inside the box, because none could be found, so it must have adhered (to the inside of the tube) pretty well."
1111557|ALSJ||Although Neil did take two Hasselblad images - 5963 and 5964 - of the first core, he didn't get much stereo separation. He turned slightly to his left between the frames but didn't take a step to one side to get stereo. Erwin D'Hoore has created an <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11rb5963-4HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">anaglyph</a> from the pair, but the only significant stereo effect is due to the fact that Buzz moved between the frames. Neil did not take any photos of the second core.
1111946|ALSJ||These are caps for the ends of the core tubes.
1112009|ALSJ||The aseptic samples would be the ones to be put in the vacuum-sealed cans. This is the "Envir/Gas Samp" indicated on Buzz's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>. As mentioned at 111:22:53, by the time Neil collects some undocumented rock samples, time runs out and they never do get any samples in the cans.
1112009|ALSJ||Buzz gets the solar wind and, as he moves, shifts his weight from foot to foot in a loping stride, albeit with relatively short steps compared with those taken by some members of later crews. He will put the solar wind in a protective, Teflon bag before putting it in the rock box. While he works on the solar wind, Neil goes off-camera to the right to collect rock samples.
1112009|ALSJ|LMP|The solar wind disengaged from its staff quite easily. When it rolled up, it had a tendency to sneak off to the side and crinkle on the edges. I spent some 20 to 30 seconds unrolling it and trying to get it a little smoother. I then remembered that they really didn't care about exact neatness. All they wanted was the material back, because they were going to cut it up in many pieces anyway. So I just bunched it together and it slid into its container (the Teflon bag) fairly easily.
1112116|ALSJ||Neil has come back into view, near the right edge of the TV picture. He is using a pair of long-handled <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy49.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">tongs</a> to collect rocks, wielding the tongs with his right hand and putting the rocks into a weigh bag which he is holding in his left.
1112116|ALSJ|CDR|I went around and, in whatever time I had left there, I picked up just the most different kinds of rocks in the immediate area of the lunar module that I could.
1112116|ALSJ||As he collects each sample, Neil bends his right knee and rotates slightly to his left in order to get the tongs down to the surface. Then, as he straightens up, he rotates back to his original position and brings the bag across in front of him to receive the sample.
1112116|ALSJ||In total, he collected about 20 rocks with a total weight of about 6 kilograms. Some of these can be seen in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6945002" target="alsj">Documented Sample rock box</a> as it was being opened at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on 26 July 1969.
1112116|ALSJ||One of the samples that Neil collected during this time, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-10072_0sml.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Sample No. 10072</a>, is a 447-gram piece of vesicular basalt. A portion of this sample, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-10072_80crp.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Sample No. 10072,80</a>, weighing 142 grams, was hand-carried to Australia by Honeysuckle Creek veteran <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../a16/a16.eva2wake.html#1394004" target="alsj">John Saxon</a> in 1994 and was presented by John Young to honor Australia's contribution to the success of Apollo 11 twenty-five years previously. Sample 10072,80 can be <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-10072-80.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">seen at the visitor's center at the Tidbinbilla Tracking Station near Canberra</a>.

1112116|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt notes that the small, white areas, particuarly at the lower right in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-10072_80crp.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LRL photo</a>, "are the result of shattered plagioclase feldspar crystals in the fine matrix. The contrast is heightened because of the ubiquitous patina of brown glass splatter that is on all exposed surfaces."
1112116|ALSJ||After Buzz finishes removing the foil from the solar wind collector, he tries to stab the pole back into the ground. Apparently, he is not happy that it will stay upright and moves it about three feet to the left and stabs it into the ground a second time. It stays upright as he moves back toward the MESA to pack the solar wind in its Teflon bag.
1112116|ALSJ||Bruce is reminding Buzz to pack the film cassette (or magazine), as indicated in his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>.
1112234|ALSJ||Later crews will wear a device called the yo-yo, which is a spring-wound cable on an enclosed reel. They attached the yo-yo case to their hoses at waist height and then attached a clip at the end of the yo-yo cable to the tongs or some other long-handled tool. Then, whenever they needed to use the tongs, they simply grabbed the tool handle, pulled it out into position for use and, when they were done, let go and the cable pulled the tool back out of the way at their waist. During the 1991 mission review, Buzz remembered that there were discussions about the need for such a device at some point after Apollo 11.
1112259|ALSJ|CDR|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11PostFlightPressConf.html target="alsj">post-mission press conference</a>) - "The primary difficulty that we observed was that there was just far too little time to do the variety of things that we would have liked to have done. (There were) rocks in a boulder field (that we photographed) out Buzz's window that were 3 and 4 feet in size. Very likely pieces of lunar bedrock. And it would have been very interesting to go over and get some samples of those. We have the problem of a 5-year-old boy in a candy store. There are just too many interesting things to do."
1112259|ALSJ||<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Photogrammetry.html" target="alsj">Photogrammetric analysis</a> of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_5516bld-E-sm.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS11-37-5516</a>, a post-EVA photo taken out Buzz's window and various shots taken during the EVA shows that three of the nearer rocks in this boulder field are 80 to 100 m from the LM.
1112259|ALSJ|LMP|It is the sort of thing you just cannot anticipate before flight. You can plan to some degree when you are on the surface but, until you get out and look around, you can't make your final decision as to what you are really going to do. (From) inside (the cabin), you are only looking at perhaps 60 percent of the available panorama. We were supposedly in a nondescript area, but there was far more to investigate than we could ever hope to cover. We didn't even scratch the surface.
1112259|ALSJ|CDR|I'll be interested in getting the pictures back and looking at them. I think you'll find that, even though it is not a terribly rough area - it is basically a smooth area - operating around in any type of vehicle is going to take some planning. The Moon has fairly steep slopes, deep holes, ridges, et cetera. I am sure that we can devise things that will do that, but it isn't going to be just any vehicle that will cover that kind of ground.
1112259|ALSJ|LMP|It will be interesting to see just how soon you depart from the walking-return concept. I don't think you can stretch that too far. I wouldn't guess as to what that distance is: you could give some reasonable distance you could return on foot, but it isn't miles. When you talk about miles, you are talking about being out of sight of the LM.
1112259|ALSJ||By the end of Apollo 12, enough experience had been gained with mare sites that a place like the immediate vicinity of the Apollo 11 LM would have been of little scientific interest. The rocks collected by the Apollo 11 and 12 crews provided general information about the properties of typical mare basalts and, with that matter settled, it was of greater interest to sample non-mare materials or to look for samples on the rims of large craters that would show if there were any variations in basalt properties with depth. What the crews needed to do was to explore larger areas around a single landing site and, in May 1969, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ThomasOPaineNASA.jpg" title="Official NASA Portrait" target="alsj">NASA Administrator Thomas Paine</a> gave his approval for the development of a small roving vehicle that would let the astronauts drive to a variety of places in a landing site area. Buzz's statement about a walking return refers to the concept of emergency walk-back in which the astronaut would walk back to the LM in the event of a Rover failure. Of necessity, at any given time they could not be farther from the LM than the distance they could safely cover with their remaining cooling water and oxygen. The Apollo 12 and 14 crews walked for distances of up to 1.5 kilometers with no significant difficulty and, for the Rover missions, walk-back constraints were developed from their experience.
1112259|ALSJ||During a drive from one crater or large boulder to the next, a Rover crew might have commented on the frequency of rocks and the size and depth of craters, but would have seen nothing sufficiently out of the ordinary to warrant a stop. This line of thought calls to mind a trip to Africa I made in 1977 and the general excitement that came over the entire tour group when we saw our first giraffe. However, after a few days we had seen so many giraffe that they were no longer worth more than a passing glance.
1112329|ALSJ||Buzz has moved over to the left end of the MESA and, while holding onto the MESA with his left hand for stability, bends his knees and reaches forward with his right hand to grab the close-up camera. With the MESA to hold on to, he gets up easily. He then goes over into the LM shadow, near the ladder, to remove the film magazine from the camera.
1112404|ALSJ||Neil bends his right knee so that he can get low enough get the film magazine in the utility pocket ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/EMUf2-1.gif" title="image" target="alsj">150k</a> ) on Buzz's left thigh. Although Neil is wearing a strap-on pocket on his left thigh to hold the contingency sampler, Buzz is not wearing a strap-on pocket, as can be seen in AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5903" target="alsj">5903</a> and in a <a href="images11.html#S6938930" target="alsj">pre-flight photo of his suit</a>.
1112404|ALSJ||This statement suggests that, after Neil got the pocket open, he had Buzz help him hold it open long enough for him to get the magazine in.
1112453|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Bethany Lewis notes that this is probably the first use of Spanish on the lunar surface. Living in Houston with its substantial Hispanic population, the astronauts would have picked up at least a little Spanish simply by living there.
1112527|ALSJ||Note that Buzz is not taking the time to have Neil clean his suit as indicated in his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#buzzcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>. Neil goes to the MESA, Buzz starts up the ladder.
1112527|ALSJ||We miss Buzz's jump onto the ladder because, unfortunately, Neil walks in front of Buzz just as he jumps up to the first rung and then, for the next several rungs, he is obscured by the U.S. flag in the foreground. When he reappears, he is in such deep shadow that it is difficult to tell what he is doing. However, his movements seem consistent with those of later astronauts who could be watched with a much better TV system. What he seems to be doing is moving his hands up the outside rails and then, with a combination of pulling with his arms and pushing with his legs, he jumps up to the next rung. Once he reaches the porch, he stops, perhaps to get the LEC (Lunar Equipment conveyor, the clothesline) ready for use. Note that, in the interest of collecting samples, Neil does not take the LMP Ingress photos indicated in his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>.
1112527|ALSJ||At some point during the closeout, Neil decides to use dirt as packing for the rocks he has put in the open rock box (ALSRC 1003, aka the Documented Sample container). In all, he shovels in about 6 kilograms. Jim Gooding describes this sample as being very representative of the mare regolith and that, because there is so much of it, it is the material which is now being put to use in lunar base engineering studies. Small amounts have been used in lab-scale demonstrations of processes proposed for the manufacture of such basic engineering materials as cement and ceramics. From the TV, it is not at all obvious when or how he collects this soil. Because he had the tongs with him while he was collecting rocks, it seems most likely that he collected this soil once he got back to the MESA. The lack of any movements in the TV that can be easily interpreted as soil collection suggests that he was able to reach down to the surface with the scoop without bending over very much at all.
1112527|ALSJ||Note added in 2006: My original impression, source unknown at this writing, is that Neil added about 6 kilograms of regolith to the Documented Sample container before closing it. However, the Apollo 11 Lunar Sample Catalog ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11SampleCat.pdf" target="alsj">16Mb PDF</a>) indicates that it was the Bulk Sample container into which he put 6 kilos of loose regolith; and that he only put about 0.5 kilos of regolith into the Documented Sample container. Whatever the details of how much he collected at any particular point in the EVA, it is clear that Neil collected a great deal more lunar soil than had been planned and put a great deal of it loose into the boxes because there was room for it. He was using his head and putting the limited time available to good use.
1112527|ALSJ||As can be seen in full-resolution versions of the restored video, about 40 seconds before Buzz's next transmission, he reaches the top of the ladder and, before he gets up on the porch, appears to be doing something with his left hand at the base of the porch rail. In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5868WaistTether.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS11-40-5868, taken by Neil as Buzz was climbing down the ladder not long after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1093943" target="alsj">109:39:43</a>, we see the large waist-tether snap hook Buzz attached to the base of the left porch rail. Note that the strap goes from the base of the large hook up onto the porch, around the inside of the porch rail, and then hangs down with the small waist-tether snap hook visible behind the ladder strut. Before going up on the porch, Buzz may be repositioning the hook and strap so that the strap hangs its full length and the small hook may be in Neil's reach, as Buzz suggests at 111:26:47. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11detS69-31114WaistTether.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from training photo S69-31114 shows a waist tether hanging down its full length with a Hasselblad attached to the small hook. The waist tether is 50 inches (127 cm) long from hook tip to hook tip .
1112527|ALSJ||Buzz is suggesting that, rather than use the LEC, clothesline-style for the second rock box, Neil hook the box to the small waist-tether hook, climb up to the porch, and then pull the box up hand-over-hand. In the end, Neil decides not to do that but, on Apollos 16 and 17, the crews will do several transfers that way.
1112705|ALSJ||As indicated on his <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#neilcuf" target="alsj">checklist</a>, Neil is removing the Hasselblad magazine so he can attach it to the first rock box - the one containing the bulk sample - for transfer up to the cabin. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#MagS1" target="alsj">magazine</a> has a hook attached to the back for this purpose.
1112705|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Andrew Vignaux suggests that, before removing the magazine, Neil advances the film, undoubtedly to prevent the last EVA images from getting sunstruck. Without aiming the camera, Neil gets two incidental frames showing views to the southeast, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_eva_thumbs.html#Core" target="alsj">5965</a> and 5966</a>. Vignaux suggests that these may have been accidental exposures. The next four frames, AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5967" target="alsj">5967</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5968" target="alsj">5968</a>, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5969" target="alsj">5969</a>, and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5970" target="alsj">5970</a>, give views to the northwest and almost certainly represent purposeful film advances. The final frame is, indeed, sunstruck. In the two views to the southeast, 5965 and 66, we see some deeply-shadowed Mylar covering, possibly part of the MESA blanket; and, on the surface, the parallel shadows of the south (minus-Y) strut and probe. Compare with <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5850" target="alsj">5850</a>. The first two views to the northwest, 5967 and 68, show the TV camera and SWC pole and, in the lower left a fuzzy, triangular area that may be Neil's left arm which, because it is so close to the camera, is out of focus. With regard to the last two frames, 5969 and 5970, Vignaux suggests that the fuzzy, dark area on the left is the left side of Neil's suit, as indicated in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5970.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled version of 5970</a> . Throughout this interval, Neil is at the MESA, facing the spacecraft, and the difference in direction between the first two frames and the rest is undoubtedly the result of Neil changing the orientation of the camera.
1112705|ALSJ||Neil will attach the magazine to the LEC at about 111:27:46. Note that, as planned, Neil and Buzz removed the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="alsj">dark slide</a> from the magazine in the cabin early in preparations for the EVA and stowed it in the LHSSC (Left Hand Side Stowage Compartment). They will insert the dark slide again once the magazine is back in the cabin.
1112726|ALSJ|LMP|The hatch moved inward very easily. As I faced the hatch, I moved the (<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html" target="alsj">spare, non-EVA Hasselblad</a>) camera from its position on the right side (Buzz's right as he came in) of the floor, up onto the (plus) Z-27 bulkhead (on what is also called the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a>). (In getting in) I had very little difficulty, again using the same technique that Neil used (at the start of the EVA when he went part way out and then tested his ability to re-enter). About halfway in, make a concerted effort to arch your back to keep the PLSS down by keeping your belly down against the floor. This affords you the least profile going in. There didn't seem to be any exertion at all associated with raising yourself up and transitioning to a point where you can bring your knees on inside the cockpit, and then moving from a kneeling (position) to an upright position. It all seemed to work quite smoothly. When there is a large bulk (that is, the PLSS), attached to you, you have to be careful. Once you get inside, before you start to turn around, you must make adequate allowance for all this material behind you."
1112726|ALSJ|CDR|That was an interface problem. As a matter of caution, each person should be helping the other as much as possible. The first man in has the biggest problem, at least when he gets inside the cockpit. He has nobody to help him with clearance and I'm sure he must use a good bit of caution.
1112726|ALSJ||The other side of that issue is that the first person in doesn't have somebody standing behind the hatch, and that gives him more room to maneuver. However, generally the Commanders watched the LMPs go in through the hatch, and helped them get aligned in the narrow opening.
1112726|ALSJ|LMP|The LEC didn't seem to get in the way at all while I was getting in. We had the mirror available, but I don't think either of us found any particular use for it.
1112726|ALSJ||Buzz is referring to a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det69H134mirror.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">metal mirror</a> that could be mounted over either window or could be used handheld. The Apollo 16 and 17 crews wore small, wrist-mounted mirrors so that, if necessary, they could examine the front of their own suits. See a discussion after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a17.eva3prep.html#1631953" target="alsj">163:19:53</a> in the A17LSJ.
1112726|ALSJ||Neil moves sideways to his right from the MESA an prepares the LEC for attachment of the first rock box.
1112726|ALSJ||Apparently, Houston thinks that Buzz took a rock box up with him, or hauled it up with the waist tether from the porch.
1112939|ALSJ||Neil has had some trouble closing the rock box, but now has it closed. In an effort to prevent contamination of the lunar environment, the contractor had cleaned the hinges. This meant that there was no lubricant and that the force Neil had to apply to close the top increased from 20-25 pounds up to 32 pounds. For subsequent missions, the hinge surfaces were burnished to reduce the closing force.
1112939|ALSJ|CDR|Closing the bulk sample box (the first rock box) took a lot more strength than I had expected. It took just about everything I could do to close the documented sample box (the second rock box). I was afraid I might have left the seal in the box. I don't think I did, because, at the time, I thought I remembered clearly taking the seal off and throwing it away; but that's what it felt like.
1112939|ALSJ||The rock box sealing mechanism consists of O-rings on the inner and outer edges and, between them in the bottom rim, a knife edge and, in the top rim, a strip of soft indium metal into which the knife edge would seat. To prevent contact between the knife edge and the indium prior to use of the box on the Moon, when the box was being prepared in a vacuum chamber on Earth, a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tools/judy87.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">stiff Teflon spacer</a> was inserted to keep the two separated. Closing a box with its spacer in place would have required considerable force and that is why, when Neil first opened the boxes on the Moon, he discarded the spacers.
1112939|ALSJ|CDR|I inadvertently tried to close one with the seal in place at one time during training, and this was very much the same kind of situation. It took an inordinate amount of force. There's another difficulty in the fact that the gravity is so low that the box tends to slip around very easily. It feels very light (and) skids away from you. So, in addition to closing it, you have to hold it firmly down on the table. The table's not very rigid. It's quite flexible. So, just holding the box securely enough in position to apply the high force on the sealing handles was some trouble.
1112939|ALSJ||The table is a frame on the MESA designed to hold a rock box and can be seen in training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6931080" target="alsj"> S69-31080</a>.
1112939|ALSJ||Now, Neil gets the LEC which has been hanging from the porch, hooks the SRC on, and goes west of the ladder to get the line in tension. He goes out of the field-of-view and, after a moment, the SRC starts moving up toward the cabin.
1112939|ALSJ||Training photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#S6932232" target="alsj">S69-32232</a> shows Neil operating the LEC while Buzz watches. During the mission, Buzz was always in the cabin during LEC operations.
1113130|ALSJ||With the SRC up to the porch, Buzz asks Neil to ease the tension in the line so that the rock box will drop down enough to come through the hatch and into grabbing range.
1113130|ALSJ|CDR|Concerning the LEC, I had neglected to lock one of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.lec.gif" target="alsj">LEC hooks</a> which normally wouldn't have caused any trouble. You would expect to proceed normally whether that was locked or not. However, for some unknown reason, when I got the SRC about half way up, the Hasselblad pack just fell off. I can't account for that. I just took the pack on up and attached it, and ensured that it was locked when I put it on the SRC the second time. When it fell onto the surface, it was covered with surface material."
1113130|ALSJ|LMP|I'm sure there is a lot of inertia with any package like that and, with that low gravity, it tends to swing back and forth; and if there is some tendency to reach an unlocked position, it will.
1113158|ALSJ|LMP|It appears that objects can be handled easier in one-sixth g than we had anticipated. In maneuvering objects around, they do have a certain mass. When they get going in a direction, they will keep going that way. This was evidenced when the objects were coming in the hatch on the LEC. They were fairly easy to manage, but you had to take your time in handling them.
1113158|ALSJ|LMP|Subjectively comparing the weight of the boxes, I would say (that the apparent weight on the Moon relative to the apparent weight on the Earth was) closer to one to ten - just judging the differences in weight and feel of things and the way the masses behaved.
1113158|ALSJ||The Apollo 17 crew attributed this impression, in part, to the fact that, for much of the time during the EVAs they didn't handle heavy objects. After hours of handling light objects, a heavy object like a rock box felt really heavy. Of course, Buzz had carried the EASEP packages out to the deployment site only an hour before climbing into the LM, so the effect would not have been as great for him.
1113158|ALSJ|LMP|Now, in your own maneuvering around, it doesn't seem to be anything like a factor of six in the ease of being able to do things. It would appear as though the gravity difference was much less. What I'm saying is that it looks like the human can adapt himself to this quite easily.
1113158|ALSJ||Neil goes to the ladder and leans on it with one hand so that he can reach down to get the film pack.
1113158|ALSJ|CDR|There was no problem (picking up the film magazine) because the ladder was right there. So I just leaned over and down to the ground and picked it up. I had the ladder to hold on to, and then I could push myself right back up to a standing position.
1113158|ALSJ||This is a disguised request that Neil slow down for a moment. He is at the MESA. Starting with the final sample collection and now during the closeout, his heart rate has been rising to a peak of nearly 160 beats per minute. Buzz's peak heart rate during the EVA was about 105. See Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mr_fig12_3eng.gif" title="image" target="alsj">12-3</a> redrafted from the Apollo 11 Mission Report by Thomas Schwagmeier. In response to a question in 2002, Neil remembers that his resting heart rate "was usually about 60".
1113158|ALSJ|CDR|It's not surprising. This was a fairly heavy workload.
1113158|ALSJ||I asked if Buzz just got the rock boxes out of the way or stored them in the hard points.
1113158|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that we got them up there (into the cabin) and laid them down someplace out of the way and got on with the work.
1113158|ALSJ|CMP|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1123429 target="alsj">112:34:29</a>. There is no further mention of the experiment during the flight.
1113158|ALSJ||James E. Faller, LRRR PI, from a 2005 e-mail - "Lick did range on July 20th, and I was there as a part of that activity with the group controlling the laser and return electronics. To my knowledge, there were no known returns. As you may know, a search was required as they didn't land at the planned spot. It was a search for a weak signal in a large lunar landscape."
1113158|ALSJ|CMP|http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14.jpg title="image" target="alsj">5-14</a> for the areas searched by Collins on various post-landing passes. Each of the small squares is 1 km on a side and the circles represent the sextant field-of-view.
1113158|ALSJ||Faller - "I remember that NASA hoped for a return signal while the astronauts were still on the lunar surface because there was considerable fear that the blast off of the lunar vehicle would result in the array being covered with 'lunar sand'. In fact, during the design of the experiment, here had been considerable debate if it would be a good idea or not to have a cover over the array to be opened after the lift-off. But it was finally decided to avoid the single-point failure mode - the cover release mechanism failing - and risk the lunar sand. Amazingly, to my knowledge, the array has not suffered from slowly accumulating sand as can be judged from the fact of the return signal strength not changing over all these years."
1113158|ALSJ||We had tried to get a return on a few nights subsequent to the 20th, with no success, and then took a break. I don't remember exactly why we stopped for a while -- perhaps because the illumination was bad -- but I remember taking a few days off.
1113158|ALSJ||Once the telescope at Lick Observatory (about 25 km east of the airport at San Jose, California) was pointed close to the Apollo 11 landing site, final pointing and guidance during a set of laser pulses was done visually. This was most easily done when the Sun was low in the sky at Tranquility Base, giving good shadow definition. Once the experiment team had a good visual understanding of the site, the telescope could be correctly aimed when the site was illuminated from higher Sun elevations.
1113436|ALSJ|CDR|The LEC worked as expected; however, I have a few comments worth noting. The primary one is that the LEC was a great attractor of lunar dust. It was impossible to <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.lec.gif" target="alsj">operate the LEC</a> without getting it on the ground some of the time. Whenever it touched the surface (or, for that matter, Neil's gloves), it picked up a lot of the surface powder. As the LEC was operated, that powder was carried up into the cabin. When the LEC went through the pulley, the lunar dust would shake off, and the part of the LEC that was coming down would rain powder on top of me, the MESA, and the SRCs so that we all looked like chimney sweeps. I was just covered with this powder, primarily as a result of dirt being thrown out by the LEC. This also tended to bind the pulley. I felt like there was enough silt collecting in the pulley that it was actually binding. Fortunately, Buzz was able to help a great deal. He actually put the majority of the forces into pulling the boxes up from the top end, rather than me from the bottom end. I was standing at a very severe angle (leaning back), which prevented me from using as much force as I had planned for pulling. The ground was too soft and my feet slipped easily. I was leaning over at approximately a 45-degree angle. I had one foot behind me so that, if my foot slipped, I wouldn't fall down. I couldn't get the footing in this soft powder that you needed to do that job."
1113436|ALSJ|LMP|There are several points (means factors") that tend to make footing more difficult. One is the powdery, graphite-like substance. (Lunar dust is very fine, like graphite. However, unlike graphite, it is very abrasive.) When it comes in contact with rock, it makes the rock quite slippery. I checked this on a fairly smooth, sloped rock. It was quite easy to get this material on it, and the boot would slip fairly easily. That factor tends to make one more unstable. The second point is that the surface may look the same, but we found that in many areas - with just very small changes in the local surface topography - there would be unexpected differences in the consistency and softness of this top layer. For example, we might find in some areas where there was just a small slope that, when we were on the edge of this slope, there would be little change in the depth at which we penetrated. In other places, we would find we had put our feet down and we would tend to depress this surface to a new location (means "penetration distance"), as if there were a different depth of the resistive surface. These two factors gave us a low confidence level in our balance and footing setups."
1113436|ALSJ|LMP|To keep the LEC coming smoothly on the inside and to have me pull on it in the appropriate direction so that it neither tangled up near the pulley end nor tended to move or slide the pulley as it went out the hatch, I found that I was completely unable to look out the window at the same time. It was a question of my looking at the LEC, talking to Neil, and hoping we were coordinated. It would be nice to work this over more and try to find some way to maintain visual contact back and forth. I didn't find that easy to do.
1113436|ALSJ||Starting with Apollo 14, the astronauts carried various pieces of gear up the ladder by hand. Indeed, the clothesline LEC was not flown on Apollo 16 or 17. Those crews carried everything up to the cabin by hand, except for the equipment bag containing the cameras, which they raised or lowered using a lanyard they attached to the porch rail. As Buzz's comments suggest, the LEC was not a simple device to use and, in the end, the astronauts decided that it was more trouble than it was worth.
1113436|ALSJ||Neil now has the second SRC on the LEC and has moved just west of the ladder, holding the line.
1113632|ALSJ||Just below the shoulder on each sleeve, Buzz has a small pocket ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/EMUf2-1.gif" title="image" target="alsj">150k</a> ). One of them contains a small packet of memorial items that he and Neil want to place on the surface. Buzz relates in his 1989 book, </i>Men from Earth<i>, that the items included (1) an Apollo 1 patch commemorating Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, the astronauts who had died in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire; (2) a Soviet medal commemorating Vladimir Komarov, who was killed at the end of the Soyuz 1 flight when the parachutes on his spacecraft failed; (3) a Soviet medal honoring Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth, who had been killed in an aircraft accident seven years after his historic 1961 flight; and, finally, (4) a small, gold olive branch identical to the ones that they were carrying for the three Apollo 11 wives.
1113632|ALSJ||NASA News Release No. 69-83F, dated 13 July 1969 mentions the Apollo 1 patch, the gold olive branch, and a silicion message disk but not the Soviet items. Ulrich Lotzmann has provided a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11memorials.html" target="alsj">summary</a>. Goodnight CapCom Owen Garriott asks abut the message disk at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html#1145228" target="alsj">114:52:28</a>.
1113632|ALSJ||In his 1973 book </i>Return to Earth<i> - repeated in </i>Men from Earth<i> - Buzz states that, when he was halfway up the ladder - that is, at about 111:26 - Neil reminded him to take care of this task. Clearly, the reminder came a little later than Buzz remembered but, as Journal Contributor Jim Failes notes, "it was a busy EVA".
1113632|ALSJ|LMP|We had forgotten about this up to this point. And I don't think we really wanted to totally openly talk about what it was. So it was sort of guarded. And I knew what he was talking about...
1113632|ALSJ|CDR|About it being on your sleeve.
1113632|ALSJ||From Neil's actions in the TV record, it appears that Buzz has tossed the package down to the surface. It falls to Neil's right. He turns and, apparently, moves it slightly with his foot.
1113715|ALSJ||In addition to the memorial items they have just placed on the surface, Neil and Buzz have in the cabin small pieces of the original Wright Flyer. These items are currently on display at the National Air and Space Museum, as shown in an Angele Glover <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11kenwrightflyer.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">photo</a> of Ken and the display in September 2005. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11wright.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">close-up photograph</a> of the display has been provided by the NASM Public Affairs Office for use in the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal. Other uses of the image require approval from the NASM Public Affairs Office.
1113715|ALSJ|CDR| To the left of the fragments is reproduction (also greatly reduced in size) of a letter from Neil A. Armstrong, Command Pilot, dated 26 January 1970: I certify that the wooden and fabric materials presented by the Air Force Museum were placed aboard Apollo XI and carried to the surface of the moon by the lunar module 'Eagle' on mankind's first lunar landing, July 20, 1969."
1113715|ALSJ||At 111:37:22, Neil climbed up onto the footpad and, just as Bruce's question gets to him, he pushes up with his legs and pulls with his arms.
1113715|ALSJ|LMP|The first step up to the bottom rung is a pretty good step, though Neil tells me he got up to the third one.
1113715|ALSJ|CDR|The third step.
1113715|ALSJ|LMP|The capability exists to do a good bit more in terms of a vertical jump than certainly the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#POGO" target="alsj">POGO</a> leads you to believe. There's no way to evaluate that in an airplane (because the cabin ceiling is too low). The big problem in the POGO was that it just didn't seem to be able to bring you down with enough to bear so that your inertia would carry you as far as it's able to with good leg extension."
1113715|ALSJ||My interpretation of what Buzz is saying is that, when he bent his legs to get a good upward push, the POGO wouldn't let him get his knees bent as much as he could on the Moon. Another possibility is that POGO's response to his push upward didn't take him as far up as he got on the Moon.
1113715|ALSJ|CDR|The technique I used was one in which I did a deep knee bend with both legs and got my torso down absolutely as close to the footpad as I could. I then sprang vertically up and guided myself with my hands by use of the handrails. That's how I go to the third step, which I guess was easily 5 to 6 feet above the ground.
1113715|ALSJ||Although relatively few jumps up the ladder were recorded on TV, Neil's may be an Apollo record. On the later missions, the astronauts often were carrying something and wouldn't have tried to jump quite as high.
1113715|ALSJ|LMP|The rungs of the ladder were not, in any way, dangerously slippery. Material on the bottom of your boots tended to cause them to slide back and forth.
1113715|ALSJ|CDR|They were a little slippery.
1113715|ALSJ||Members of later crews usually stomped their feet on the first rung when they got up on the ladder, a technique that removed a great deal of dust from the boots and lower legs.
1113715|ALSJ||When Neil got to the top of the ladder, he probably unhooked the waist tether from the porch rail, so he could take it in the cabin. They would need both waist tethers if they had to make an EVA transfer to the Command Module.
1113858|ALSJ||In a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/hatch_handle.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled detail</a> by Thomas Schwagmeier, the latching decal reads, Latch Operation: 1.Insert handle in end of shaft; 2.

In emergency - if latch is jammed in locked position - To open hatch pull landyard to remove lock pin, rotate cam plate out of way of latch and open hatch.
1113858|ALSJ||It is easier to reach each other's valves.
1113858|ALSJ||Neil put the contingency sample in this thigh pocket at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1093647" target="alsj">109:36:47</a>. Bruce is reminding Neil to put either the contingency sample or, perhaps more likely, the strap-on pocket, on the ascent cover. There is no mention of the sample in the checklists or transcripts that I have been able to find; but there is a statement in the Apollo 11 Sample Catalog ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11SampleCat.pdf" target="alsj">15 Mb</a> ) on page 14 that "the contingency sample container was stowed in a Beta-cloth bag during the return trip (to Earth) and accompanied the astronauts to the Crew Reception Area of the LRL (Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston).
1113858|ALSJ||During the 1991 mission review, I asked Neil and Buzz if they had anything they wanted to say about having gotten the EVA out of the way.
1113858|ALSJ|LMP|After the landing, there was still a lot to get done, I mean, the whole (process of getting ready to) go outside. After we got back in here, I think it was a little bit of downhill - slightly - at this point. 'Cause we didn't have anything really pressing except, I guess, the communications was a little disturbing when that doesn't work too well.
1113858|ALSJ|CDR|I would mention that - and I can't speak for Buzz - I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the environment inside the suit. The suit was cumbersome and bulky and not really easy to operate, but on the whole, for the first time of actually having it in the foreign environment - that we could (only partly) simulate in vacuum chambers and things like that - it performed remarkably well. When you think that the surface temperature was something north of 100 centigrade, in terms of the (air) flow and the cooling, it was really doing an excellent job, and allowed us to really do most of the things we planned to do - although perhaps not as quickly as we would have liked to do them - without really any difficulties from the environment that was provided by the suit.
1113858|ALSJ|LMP|I guess I didn't have any particular feelings - good or bad - about the suit. And that's typically the case when things work okay. I wasn't anticipating any trouble, and it all worked so smoothly. (During the EVA) I felt a little bit (like I was) following the activities out there instead of leading the activities. In other words, reacting to things. I didn't feel as though they were going in a way that I was right on top of what was happening all the time. There were sort of 'Well, I guess we ought to do this next, and then this and then this.' There wasn't that feeling, you know, of checking off things one after another. And I think it may be typical of forgetting to deploy those things in the pocket. There wasn't a particular thing set in the flight plan to do that; it was sort of an unofficial thing. And, then, it sort of slipped our minds because of the other things happening. I don't know how much you'd have to go through and rehearse all of it to change that feeling. Maybe I was expecting more than I should have.
1113858|ALSJ||I noted that they were the first crew to experience how long it took to get things done and asked if that was part of it.
1113858|ALSJ|CDR|That's part of it. I would just say that I share Buzz's feeling that we probably were a bit disappointed that we weren't ahead of everything all the time, rather than sort of trying to catch up all the time. But, on balance, looking back on it, we did get almost everything done that we had intended to do. Some things didn't go as smoothly as we would have liked, but we also did some things that we hadn't expected to do. On balance, I had to be pretty pleased with the way it came out in an integrated fashion.
1113858|ALSJ|LMP|Lunar surface activities are not as precise and crisp as other things in the spacecraft: (that is, times outside the LM) where you're setting up to do something and then something else happens. They're sort of very subjective and kind of reactive. And maybe that was different for me during this portion of the mission than the others.
1113858|ALSJ||I asked if they had much of a chance to talk with the 12 crew before heading out on their world tour.
1113858|ALSJ|CDR|Not as much as we would have liked, because the world tour and all of the other things we were involved in really took us away from that conversation with later crews. Nonetheless, we had some and they would certainly talk to us when it was convenient.
1113858|ALSJ|LMP|We weren't totally inaccessible.
1113858|ALSJ||During the 1969 Technical Debrief and the discussion of the dropped Hasselblad magazine, Buzz asked Neil if "the film magazine hit the pad or dropped right to the surface".
1113858|ALSJ|CDR|I think it hit the surface clear of the pad, on the right side, which would be the spacecraft's left. I wasn't worried about the (possible fire hazard from dust on the) contingency sample, because that was inside a bag. If anything was going to catch fire, it was going to be my whole suit, because it was just covered with that stuff.
1113858|ALSJ||When asked in early 2014 about the source of speculation about spontaneous combustion of lunar dust when exposed to oxygen in the LM cabin, Jack Schmitt wrote, "This was another stink bomb that Tommy Gold threw over the transom - that is Tommy Gold of 'sinking out of sight in dust' fame. NASA could never say 'shut up' to Gold, so we played lip service to worrying about pyrophoricity but basically ignored the question. There was no scientific rationale to think this was a problem."

1115250|ALSJ|LMP|Where's the contingency sample right now?
1115250|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know. I mean, we don't care about that anymore, once we got the rock boxes.
1115250|ALSJ|LMP|Did we throw it out? Or did we keep it?
1115250|ALSJ|CDR|Oh, I think we kept it.
1115250|ALSJ|LMP|How did it get back without kind of being out loose and all that?
1115250|ALSJ|CDR|It was in my pocket.
1115250|ALSJ|LMP|I'm just trying to...because I don't remember dealing with it hardly at all.
1115250|ALSJ|CDR|It may still be in that suit pocket, for all I know.
1115250|ALSJ|LMP| You got it (at) home in your top drawer?
1115250|ALSJ||Neil stowed the sample in his tight pocket at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1093633" target="alsj">109:36:33</a>. The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a>, assures us that the Contingency Sample did make it back to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston.

1120000|ALSJ||The Moon is about to set at the <a href="http://honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/goldstone/index.html" target="alsj">Goldstone</a> tracking station in California and there will be a handover of uplink responsibilities to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11honeysuckle.gif" title="image" target="alsj">Honeysuckle Station</a> outside Canberra, Australia.
1120000|ALSJ||Mike Dinn, Deputy Director at Honeysuckle during Apollo recalls "'Handover' basically means handover from one ground station to another of 'uplink' voice, command and ranging.

Also bear in mind that there could be three uplinks - CSM, LM and EASEP/ALSEP. The 9m stations (CRO, HAW, GWM on this longitude) were generally used for the EASEP/ALSEP support."

1122056|ALSJ||The current time is about 0553 on 21 July 1969 (UTC/GMT). From the bottom of the footpads to the top of the rendezvus radar, the LM is 7.04 meters tall (23 feet, 1 inch). The solar elevation is about 15.8 degrees and the shadow length on level ground would be about 25 meters. Yuri Krasilnikov has created an animated GIF ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11anim5454-77.gif" title="two-frame movie" target="alsj">0.3 Mb</a> or <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11anim5454-77HR.gif" title="two-frame movie" target="alsj">2.7 Mb</a> ) from 5477 and photo AS11-37-5454, which Buzz took at about 2132 UTC/GMT on the 20th, not long after the landing. the animation shows, among other things, the change in shadow length. At the earlier time, the shadow length on level ground would have been about 34 meters.
1122056|ALSJ||Frames <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5466" target="alsj">5466</a> to 5468 show the flag. During the technical debriefing, Neil said, "The flagstaff was pushed into the ground at a slight angle such that the c.g. (center of gravity) of the overall unit would tend to be somewhat above the point at which the flagstaff was inserted in the lunar surface. (That is, they tilted the flag so that it would balance.) That seemed to hold alright, but I noted later, after getting back into the LM, that the weight of the flag had rotated the entire unit about the flagpole axis such that the flag was no longer pointed in the same direction as it was originally. I suspect that the weight of the flagpole probably had shifted its position in the sand a little bit from the position where it had originally been installed."
1122056|ALSJ||In <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5467" target="alsj">5467</a>, the flag still appears to be in its deployed orientation, a fact confirmed by comparison of TV taken during the PLSS jettison after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1141037" target="alsj">114:10:37</a> with TV taken during the EVA, such as a clip starting at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html#1105858" target="alsj">1105858</a>. Clearly the re-orientation Neil noticed has not yet happened. The next images of the flag we have are in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1234832" target="alsj">DAC pan</a> Buzz took about an hour after the RCS hot-fire check. Thomas Schwagmeier has <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5467_flag_compared_dac_en.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">compared</a> 5467 with a frame from Buzzs post-hot-fire DAC sequence, showing roughly a 90 degree change in orientation. Although the re-orientation Neil mentions clearly happened sometime after the PLSS jettison and before the hot-fire, we have no way of knowing how much of a change Neil noticed. That change would have been overwhelmed by the effects of the hot-fire.
1122056|ALSJ||Frame <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5480" target="alsj">5480</a> shows the view out Buzz's window, including the flag and the TV camera. Note the cluster of boulders in the background. These may have been ejected from West Crater.
1122056|ALSJ||All the photos taken at this time are out the forward windows except AS11-37-5506 to 5509 which are photos of Earth taken out the rendezvous window over Neil's head. These may be the Earth photos that Neil remembers taking - rather than AS11-40-5923 and 5924, the two taken out on the surface, probably by Buzz. Note that none of these photos have <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-reseau.html" target="alsj">reseau crosses</a>, indicating that they were taken with the IVA Hasselblad. The EVA Hasselblad was purposefully left outside.
1122056|ALSJ|LMP|This period was prolonged a bit to try to make as much use of the film remaining. I think we probably took more pictures than we should have in an effort to make sure that we covered each particular window as thoroughly as possible and with as wide a range of settings as we could before we proceeded to jettison the camera.
1122056|ALSJ||During the 1991 mission review, we talked a little about the post-EVA window pan.
1122056|ALSJ|LMP|Look at how the dust kicked up around here (near the flag and the TV camera beyond). It makes it really darker, as viewed from this angle which is sort of out to the front and the right (that is, northwest out Buzz's window).
1122056|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt has hypothesized that, during the landing, the LM engines sweep away a lot of the very fine dust and leave behind a surface with a disproportionate number of small rock fragments sticking up. These reflect more sunlight than the normal surface would, making it look brighter than normal. Certainly, from orbit, the areas around the landed LM's are brighter than the surrounding countryside. Then, when the crew walks around near the LM, they stir up the soil and return it to something closer to its normal condition. Against the abnormally bright background, then, the disturbed soil looks dark. In support of his contention, Jack notes that, at geology stations far from the LM, disturbed soil doesn't look dark.
1122056|ALSJ||I asked how the horizon looked.
1122056|ALSJ|CDR|The horizon looks close. But, because it's hilly you're probably not seeing all the horizon you could see. An intermediate hill is probably cutting it out. It wasn't mountainous in our area; it was flat. But there were still crater rims and so on that probably affected how far out the observable horizon was.
1122206|ALSJ||If they eat before they do the depress and equipment ejection, they will have to take their helmets off. There is little spare room in the cabin and, with two rock boxes, the LEVAs, the helmets, and the PLSSs in the cabin with them, they will be cramped for space. Of course, on the last three missions, the crews took their suits off between EVAs and the cabin was even more crowded. Fortunately, lunar gravity is weak enough that there is no discomfort in standing for hours at a stretch and, consequently, much of the gear can be piled - more or less out of the way - on the engine cover.
1122206|ALSJ|CDR|There was still a full truckload of equipment inside that cockpit at the end of the EVA. It's just a bunch of stuff, and I was glad that we were able to get rid of a lot of it and finish the jettison before we started our sleep period. With all that stuff in the cockpit, there's really no place left for people to relax.
1122206|ALSJ||Crews on the later missions had <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM10f1-6Hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">hammocks</a> which helped with the crowding problem during the rest period. However, on the last three missions, the crews took their suits off and piled them on the ascent engine cover. See a composite image (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17stitch20522-25eh.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">2.5 Mb</a>) made by Ed Hengeveld from Apollo 17 post-EVA photos AS17-134-20522 and 25, giving a wide view of the cabin from the LMP's station.
1122206|ALSJ|CDR|The post-EVA checklist went very well. It was well planned, and we went precisely by the pre-planned route with possibly a few exceptions. They...probably took about the same or a little more time than we expected. Of course, the time period that we took while we were waiting for the canister (replacement) before starting the depressurization was comparably long. We had to put an eat period in there, as I remember, and took a lot of pictures.
1122206|ALSJ||In the published version of the Technical Debriefing, Neil is quoted as saying "Of course, the time period that we took while we were waiting for the canister (replacement) before starting the repressurization was comparably long." Journal Contributor Thomas Schwagmeier notes that, because they wanted to wait and do the canister replacement just before they got ready to depressurize the cabin for the jettison - the used canister would be one of the things jettisoned - 'repressurization' should be 'depressurization'.
1122206|ALSJ|LMP|We elected to leave the helmets on because, at this point, there was so much stuff rattling around inside the cabin that they would have added just one more bulky item. The primary canister change proceeded quite well to the point of inserting the new canister. I ran into a minor problem in getting it to rotate fully so that I could get the cover on. When it finally did seat itself properly, I can't for sure identify what I did differently from the times it didn't seem to rotate. That seemed to be what was stopping the cover from going on completely - the fact that, when the canister was inserted, I couldn't seem to rotate it as much as I thought it should have been rotated.
1122206|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/lm_ecs_lioh_canister.jpg" target="alsj">LiOH canisters</a> go into the inboard face of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> unit behind Buzz. The replacement cannister was <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM11-co3lbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">stowed</a> behind the ascent engine cover, below the back corner ot the ECS. Buzz had to face the rear of the spacecraft to do the change, but could do it with his right hand. It is not clear when, exactly, Buzz did the canister change. He and Neil did eat prior to doing the depress and jettison and did, of course, take their helmets off for at least a little while. They reported that they were finished eating at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1131752" target="alsj">113:17:52</a>. At some point, Buzz takes AS11-37-<a href="images11.html#5528" target="alsj">5528</a>, which is an excellent portrait of Neil in his Snoopy cap.

1122220|ALSJ||The <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LastBest.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">actual landing site is Juliett 0.65, 7.52</a> and, as can be seen in Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5-14</a> in the Apollo 11 Mission Report, the landing site will be just outside the field-of-view of the CSM sextant on this pass. In the figure, each of the small squares is 1 kilometer on a side and the circles, which represent the approximate sextant field-of-view, are each about 3.2 km (2 miles) in diameter. Mike reports a negative result at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1123359" target="alsj">112:33:59</a>.
1122220|ALSJ||The sextant field-of-view covers an area equivalent to about seven squares.
1122220|ALSJ||Because Mike is orbiting the Moon at about 100 kilometers altitude, he is above the horizon at Tranquility for about 13 minutes and, in principle, could talk to the surface crew on the VHF system.

1123429|ALSJ||Information from the laser returns can be used to refine estimates of the landing site location made, so far, from tracking data and LM guidance telemetry.
1123429|ALSJ||MIke seems to be estimating the number of square in the area that includes possible LM locations Houston has mentioned since the landing: ten squares or more; twenty or more; thirty or more. Certainly a lot of squares when he can only scan one on each pass over the landing site. Certainly a lot of squares when he can only scan one on each pass over the landing site.
1123429|ALSJ||In order to maintain sextant pointing, Mike must expend a small amount of maneuvering fuel.
1123429|ALSJ||As the Command Module - or the LM, for that matter - orbits the Moon, it remains in an fixed inertial attitude. That is, the spacecraft axis remains fixed relative to the stars, but not to the lunar surface. David Woods tells us that, "while Mike is using P22 to search for the LM, he commands the CSM to make a slow, pitching motion to keep the aim point within the range over which the sextant can move it's line-of-sight. After he finishes P22, he will maneuver to attitude 082, 218, 000 so he can do a P52 realignment of the inertial platform. After finishing P52, he will leave the CSM in that attitude for his upcoming sleep period." Because the Moon doesn't move terribly far in its orbit around Earth during a rest period, the spacecraft attitude relative to Earth doesn't change very much either; and, if need be, Houston can wake Mike from his sleep during any of the front side passes.
1123429|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break
1123429|ALSJ||Either Bruce has misspoken or has misunderstood Mike's "And that'll be the sleep attitude." and thinks Mike will go to a different sleep attitude - presumably one in the flight plan. There is no further discussion of the sleep attitude after Mike completes the P52 at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1125316" target="alsj">112:53:16</a>.
1124307|ALSJ||They've weighed an RCU to calibrate the scale, then weighed the residual feedwater. The zero on the scale could be adjusted and, here, they zeroed the scale with nothing on it, weighed the RCU to give a calibration point, and then put the empty water bag on and re-zeroed the scale before weighing the full bag.
1124307|ALSJ|CDR|And the intent, here, was to begin a data base for coordinating your water usage with your metabolic rates. I think there was a plastic bag that we put the water in when we drained the PLSSs.
1124307|ALSJ||Note that Neil sounds a little congested. On Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt had a dramatic nasal reaction to lunar dust after his first EVA and, then, lesser reactions after the other EVAs. However, see the discussion following 114:31:38.

1125628|ALSJ||With space limited in the cabin, a person wearing a PLSS has ample opportunity to hit a circuit breaker without being aware of it. The engine arm circuit breaker is seventh from the left in second row of Panel 16, which is on Buzz's side. Because Neil was never on that side of the spacecraft, it has to have been Buzz who hit it.
1125628|ALSJ|LMP|There weren't guards over any of the circuit breakers. One got pushed in and one got broken off. So I must have pushed one in and broke one off (with his PLSS prior to doffing).
1125628|ALSJ||In his book, </i>Men from Earth<i> Buzz elaborates, "We discovered during a long checklist recitation that the ascent engine's arming circuit breaker was broken off on the panel. The little plastic pin (or knob) simply wasn't there. This circuit would send electrical power to the engine that would lift us off the moon...We looked around for something to punch in this circuit breaker. Luckily, a felt-tipped pen fit into the slot."
1125628|ALSJ||To prevent a recurrence of this problem, NASA decided that guards would be placed over the breakers for future flights. Furthermore, additional checks of the circuit breaker configuration were added to the checklist. Buzz will close the circuit breaker at some point after the rest period and, at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1232043" target="alsj">123:20:43</a>, about an hour before lift-off, Houston will tell the crew that telemetry indicates that the circuit breaker is in its proper, closed position.

1134632|ALSJ||The overhead valve has about twice the flow rate of the forward dump valve because it isn't equipped with a bacterial filter. However, they now have samples in the rock box so the filter is less important. The photograph of LTA-1 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum shows the forward dump valve without a bacterial filter.
1134632|ALSJ|LMP|I think they just wanted to speed it up.
1134632|ALSJ||Comm Break
1134632|ALSJ|LMP|There's no getting around it, it's another EVA Prep exercise. It's easier (because they stay on LM systems rather than having to hook up the PLSSs), but you still have to go through the same exercises such as pressure-integrity check, bleeding the cabin down, and configuring the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> (Environmental Control System). I guess if you have two EVAs, it probably would be nicer to jettison your equipment at the beginning of the second one, rather than (getting in after the first EVA, repressurizing, hooking up to the LM ECS and) having to add another Depress (to do a jettison before starting the rest period). I'm not sure how they're planning to do this."
1134632|ALSJ||On the other missions, the crews did what Buzz suggested. At the start of each EVA, they took the trash out with them. The only extra jettison was done sometime between the end of the final EVA and the launch. This final jettison was done primarily to get rid of the PLSSs.

1141037|ALSJ||Because Neil and Buzz are both right-handed, it was probably Neil, standing on the left side of the cabin, who opened the overhead valve.
1141037|ALSJ||The PLSS jettison comes at about 114:14. Both PLSSs could be seen on the TV as they tumbled out of the hatch, albeit not on the tape compilation available to us in 1991, which ends about about 112:24.

1141037|ALSJ||Returning to the 1991 Apollo 11 mission review. I asked Neil and Buzz how they got the PLSSs out.
1141037|ALSJ|LMP|We didn't seem to talk about it very much, did we? I don't think we got down on our hands and knees and pushed them out.
1141037|ALSJ|CDR|I think we could probably get down far enough (in the pressurized suit) to reach them with our gloves. I think you could get down there. I think that's more likely what we did (than kick them out as some later crews did).
1141037|ALSJ|LMP|I'd have to have reached over the door, so you (Neil) had to push 'em or kick 'em.
1141037|ALSJ|LMP|The (replacement LiOH) canister container behind the ascent engine removed very easily, and we were able to jettison it without any problems. We didn't have any problems; I didn't notice you (Neil) had any difficulty giving the packages the heave-ho. I think each PLSS bounced once on the porch before it went down.
1141037|ALSJ|CDR|Only one thing stayed on the porch. That was a small part of the left-hand-side storage container that did not make it off the porch onto the surface. That was the last item jettisoned.
1141037|ALSJ||Neil thinks they were on LM intercom, so they could talk to each other, and used the PTT trigger if they wanted to talk to Houston. Houston can monitor the proceedings through telemetry.

1141851|ALSJ||Locally-produced signals such as the PLSS impacts provided insights into the depth of the regolith and its seismic properties.
1141851|ALSJ||I asked about assignment to specialties after getting accepted into the Astronaut Corps.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|It was true for a long period of time there that individuals got assigned to particular areas. Mine happened to be training and simulation. That was predominantly to make sure that crew interests were represented in all the meetings and discussions. So, if there was a meeting on simulators or simulator requirements or something, and the person who was assigned to be simulators would be the obvious guy to go track that and it wouldn't take some master scheduler to be figuring out where people should be going all the time. That let people then decide on their own where they needed to be, covering the various issues and decisions. It was more of a convenience than anything. In some cases, I suppose, people were assigned because of educational or experience strengths in that area, so that they'd have a running start. But not always.
1141851|ALSJ||I then asked if they had any comments on the geology training. I mentioned Jack Schmitt's efforts to tailor things so that it was useful in the sense of "what do I need to know to be a good observer?", as opposed to an academic approach to geology.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|I think that was the intent, (that is) in a relatively short period of time, to bring non-geologists up to the level so that they would be adequate observers and be able to pick out those things which deserved attention or would be of interest to real geologists. And, I think they achieved that at least to some degree.
1141851|ALSJ||In his excellent book, <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/" target="alsj">To a Rocky Moon</a>, Don Wilhelms discusses the training in some detail and, among other things, notes that both Neil and Buzz were good enough students to warrant special attention from the geology instructors.
1141851|ALSJ||Houston is still trying to figure out exactly where they are.
1141851|ALSJ||In the copy of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur.pdf" target="alsj">Surface-45</a> in the ALSJ, the S-Band configuration line reads "S-BAND: PM, PRIM, PRIM, VOICE, PSM, CWEA ENABLE, </i>LEFT, HI<i>" where the last two items have been added by hand. The handprinted addition is quite tidy, suggesting that it was added pre-flight. These settings refer to the S-Band section of Panel 12 (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_S-BandPanel12MarkGray.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">detail</a> from Apollo 11 LM-5 "Eagle" poster by Mark Gray.

The first six items refer to the top row of switches: (1) Modulate switch to PM(FM); (2) XMTR/RCVR (Transmitter/Receiver) to Prim(ary); (3) PWR AMP (Power Amplifier) to Prim(ary); (4) first function switch to Voice; (5) second function switch to PSM(PCM); (6) third function switch to TV/CWLR (CWEA) Enable. The handprinted addition refers to the two telemetry switches at the right end of the second row: MonoMed to Left (Neil) and PCM to Hi. Bruce is telling them to set the third function switch to Range, rather than TV/CWLR (CWEA) Enable.

1141851|ALSJ||Post-mission analysis indicated that the most likely cause of the timer failure was a cracked solder joint caused by differential thermal expansion within the unit. By the time Neil and Buzz turn it back on - in about 5 minutes - it will have been off for about 11 hours. The resulting cool down has reversed the differential expansion and, at least temporarily, has closed the solder crack. The timer will work properly during the rest of the mission. For subsequent missions, NASA subjected the units to longer periods of vibrational, thermal, and operational testing. The LM timer and an identical unit in the Command Module were supplied by the Bulova Watch Company. The Apollo 12 CM mission timer had intermittent problems, ascribed to a cracked solder joint. According to the Apollo 12 Mission Report, modifications to the timer design were going to be made prior to Apollo 13 to reduce the chance of such problems. Further, intermittent problems were experienced with the Apollo 15 CM timer. Post-mission inspection of the unit did not reveal the cause of the problem and, since the intermittent failures were no more than a 'nuisance' to the crew, no further action was taken. Colin Fries, Frank O'Brien, and Phill Parker contributed to this discussion.
1141851|ALSJ||I asked about the need to get the timer working again, since they have at least one watch.
1141851|ALSJ|LMP|There are rapid-paced things that happen during the rendezvous and we like to have something that's a little easier to look at than an Omega (<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/omega.html" target="alsj">watch</a>)."
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|(Resetting the timer) was a matter of adjusting the numbers in the register to the current mission elapsed time and, then, on some kind of a mark from someplace, to engage the timer. It's not on (that is, driven by) any registers of the LGC; it's an independent unit.
1141851|ALSJ||I asked if they could hear any stuffiness in their voices, thinking of Jack Schmitt's allergic reaction to lunar dust.
1141851|ALSJ|LMP|It wasn't a very restful evening. How long have we been up?
1141851|ALSJ||They were awakened at 93:40 and, so, have been up for nearly 21 hours.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|And temperature control was a bit of a problem for us and it could be that cabin temperature was contributing to something.
1141851|ALSJ||I then told them about Jack Schmitt's apparent allergic reaction to lunar dust after the first Apollo 17 EVA - but not after the later ones.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|I can't say that I recall it.
1141851|ALSJ|LMP|There wasn't any particular odor.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah, I remember commenting that we had the scent of wet ashes. Something like that.
1141851|ALSJ|LMP|There was a hint of something. A slight metallic...That's hard to remember. But it wasn't a real objectionable one.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah.
1141851|ALSJ|LMP|Like it was going to catch fire.
1141851|ALSJ||Other crews described the smell as being similar to expended gunpowder. I asked if the dirt they tracked in settled to the floor pretty quickly.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|There wasn't a whole lot floating around in the cabin. Although we did tromp some in. There's no question about that.
1141851|ALSJ||I asked if they'd noticed any film of dust on the instruments. And neither of them remembered any.
1141851|ALSJ|CDR|When we got back up to zero-g, some of the stuff did come up.

1143145|ALSJ||Astronaut Owen Garriott takes over as CapCom for the EVA debriefing.
1143145|ALSJ||That is, the spacecraft is facing about 13 degrees south of west.
1143145|ALSJ|LMP|I want to inject a thought about spacecraft location (probably means 'orientation') in respect to lunar surface working conditions. Putting the area of the MESA in shadow also put the (TV) cable in the shadow. The white cable, being covered with a little bit of this powdery stuff and being in the shadow, was very difficult to observe. Consideration should be given to keeping any cable or small object out in sunlight whenever possible. It leads one to think that, if you're going to yaw one way or the other, it's preferable to put your working areas out into the sunlight.
1143145|ALSJ||The unintended left yaw put the MESA farther into the LM shadow than it would have been otherwise.
1143145|ALSJ|CDR|We discussed - pre-launch, on a number of occasions - whether we wanted to yaw specifically for lighting at touchdown. There are obviously a lot of advantages, but I was very reluctant to do any fancy maneuvering on the first lunar touchdown for selected yaw for lighting considerations. I figured we'd just take what we got; and we paid for that later, because we had a lot of operations in the shadow during the EVA that would have been easier had we had better lighting.
1143145|ALSJ||Readers should note that this quote differs from the one originally transcribed by NASA. Neil provided the correction in 1995.
1144127|ALSJ||Buzz's troubles with the core tubes were caused by the design of the tube. The top few centimeters of the lunar soil - consisting of relatively recent ejecta from craters near and far - can be quite loose and, in anticipation that the soil would be loose to considerable depth, the core tubes were designed with an internal bevel which compacted the soil entering the tube as Buzz hammered it into the ground. However, the in-place soil actually becomes quite compact at only a few inches depth because of shaking induced by countless small impacts. Consequently, once Buzz had pushed the tubes in a short way, he encountered soil which was already at near maximum density and the entrance to the tube quickly became blocked. Other designs - a small diameter tube with an exterior bevel and a large diameter, thin-walled tube with no bevel - worked beautifully on the other missions.
1144127|ALSJ||I suggested that by "moist" Buzz might have been referring to the fact that lunar dust clings to almost anything it comes in contact with.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|That plus maybe a little more perception of the color, because you're looking at particles rather than a surface. Maybe that makes it look darker. When it's a surface, maybe the reflection tends to lighten it up, in the Sun. 'Moist' was about the best I could grab hold of.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|It didn't imply any moisture. It had to do with the reflective characteristics and, also, maybe the slumping...Actually, I don't think we've mentioned earlier that you could have fairly steep walls.
1144127|ALSJ||Small trenches dug by later crews would retain virtually vertical walls.
1144127|ALSJ||I asked if the tongs or the scoop retained a coating of dust after they scraped it through the surface
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember. Certainly the boots did.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|Yeah, if there's anything that it can grab a hold of, the stuff seems to stay there.
1144127|ALSJ||Neil answers the question at 123:10:32.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|I'm just kind of wondering about that kind of question because, once you've taken panorama pictures, (the question) makes me feel a little inadequate trying to describe something in a subjective way when you've got very objective data. So, is the question, do you suppose, in case the photos and you don't make it back? That they want to know what your subjective description is?
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|They had TV panoramas.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|I feel imposed on, I'll tell ya, by those questions. I like to be an expert in an area before I get put on the spot.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think there's anything sinister. (Animated) I just think those geology guys just couldn't wait to get more detail and just wanted more information!
1144127|ALSJ||I asked if they saw any distinct evidence of stroking.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|They weren't going to bounce back, I don't think. Weren't they crushable?
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|They weren't springs. They were honeycomb inside and they took a permanent set. We probably knew what the unstroked length was, but we probably had seen that someplace in time. I think that what I said here was the best way to put it. We touched so gently that we sure didn't do much.
1144127|ALSJ||I mentioned that there is a lot of bantering on other missions about possible landing gear stroking and that it's impossible to tell how much is banter and how much is fact. Neil did not reply.
1144127|ALSJ||The distance back to West Crater is about 500 meters or about 0.3 miles, rather than 0.5 miles.
1144127|ALSJ||During the following discussion, we were looking at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psrf3-3.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Figure 3-3</a> from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, a high-resolution mosaic of Lunar Orbiter photos of the site. Figure <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-08.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5-8</a> in the Mission Report is a grainier version of the same image.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|That (West Crater) was a big dude! See, Buzz could not see it, because he was on the right side. On the LM, between the right and left crew positions, there's a panel that goes out so that either crew member can only see forward and out his side, but not to the other side. So we came over the (north side of) big West Crater, which looked enormous, humongous...To me it looked like a football stadium - you know, a circular football stadium - about that size. And he couldn't see it! (Chuckling) He couldn't appreciate that at all! We were coming right into the northeast slopes of it. And there were a lot of big boulders on that slope. A generally undesirable landing area for the first one. Geologically interesting, but not a good place to land.
1144127|ALSJ||I asked if West Crater had been named prior to the mission.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think so. I was considerably west of where we were intending to land, so it wasn't one of the those craters that we'd been looking for in the approach path.
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|It's east of where we landed, so why did it get the name West Crater? Who named it West Crater?
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know.
1144127|ALSJ||I noted that the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#flownLAM2" target="alsj"> landing ellipse</a> (about 19 km by 5 km) contains perhaps two or three dozen craters bigger than West Crater, although it's one of the largest in the southwest quadrant of the ellipse.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|You can see from this picture (meaning <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-08.gif" title="image" target="alsj">figure 5-8</a>), it does look like it's a somewhat more sharp-edged crater than this one, which is more weathered."
1144127|ALSJ|LMP|Now, where's the Cat's Paw? Wasn't it out in front of us? 'Cause we saw it on lift-off.
1144127|ALSJ||The Cat's Paw is a cluster of craters directly west of the landing ellipse. The eastern most point is at L.0/2.0 on the far left on map <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#flownLAM2" target="alsj">LAM-2</a> and is about 5.6 km from the landing site at about J.65/7.52. It is also shown in a labeled version of overhead photo AS11-37-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11LBL5447.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">5447</a>. Finally, in the post-landing panorama taken out Buzz's window (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11pan5454-58.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">123k</a>), the hill on the horizon beyond the tip of the LM shadow and the similarly-sized hill farther to the right are part of the Cat's Paw rim, as can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11det5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">comparison</a> of a detail from 5447 with portions of frames AS11-40-<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5882" target="alsj">5882</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5882a" target="alsj">5882a</a> from Buzz's plus-Z pan. The sector encompassed by the yellow lines in each image is about 25 degrees. I have not attempted to correlate the 'hills' seen from the landing site with specific features in Cat's Paw rim as seen in the overhead view.
1144127|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think we ever knew this one (meaning West Crater) was here.
1144127|ALSJ||At at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1235523" target="alsj">123:55:23</a>, about a half hour before LM liftoff, Ron Evans tells Mike that the LM is "just west of West Crater, Juliett 0.5, 7.7. Over." This suggests that the crater had been named before the flight; but I am unaware of any pre-flight map that would provide confirmation.
1144127|ALSJ||Finally, we have the following from the Crew Observations chapter of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11psr.html" target="alsj">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a> - "This crater was later identified as one we had informally called West Crater during our prelaunch training."

1145228|ALSJ|CDR|I think what he (Garriott) was referring to was the silicon disks that had the replicas of all the messages to the United States from various world leaders.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|That was in the pocket.
1145228|ALSJ||At 115:50, Public Affairs reports that the Surgeon doesn't believe that Neil is closer to sleep than "dozing". Buzz is not being monitored. In orbit, Collins is sound asleep.
1145228|ALSJ||At 116:50, Public Affairs reports that the Surgeon says Neil is 'resting' but not asleep. This recording includes a detailed status of consumables.
1145228|ALSJ||At 117:50, Public Affairs reports that the Surgeon says Neil may be 'dozing' but is not sleeping soundly or well. His heart rate drops into the 50s, but not for long.
1145228|ALSJ||At 118:50, Public Affairs reports that Mike Collins is sleeping soundly; Neil may be sleeping fitfully, if at all. Cabin temperature is 61F (16C)
1145228|ALSJ||At 119:51, Public Affairs reports that Neil has not been sleeping. His heart rate occasionally drops into the 50s - the "sleep range" - but does not stay low.
1145228|ALSJ||I asked if there were any comments they wanted to make about the sleep period.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|We had one pump...
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember being troubled too much by the noise.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|I think it was my position (that) was bothered by the noise more than yours, because you were on the floor - right? - and I was on the engine cover with a loop that'd I rigged up of some kind to hold my legs, hanging from something up there. And my head was back to the rear of the cabin and there was a glycol pump or a water pump or something very close to where my head was. But the temperature control was probably the most troublesome.
1145228|ALSJ||I speculated that the back of the cabin was small enough that Neil's legs would have hung over the front, then we found Buzz's statement at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.launch.html#1214102" target="alsj">121:41:02</a> indicating that Neil had used one of the waist tethers to keep his legs suspended. See the discussion following 121:41:02.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah, I suspended them. I rigged up a loop to hold my legs. And the other thing was (that) the Earth was coming through the AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope). (Chuckling) We had blinds over the windows and so on, but the Earth was coming through the AOT. We were all settled down and we realized that we still had a light source coming from something. We rigged up something to hang something over the top of the AOT to cut that out.

1145228|ALSJ||I asked about pressure points.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|We tried it with the helmets off, at first, but that didn't...We thought we might, somehow, be warmer with the helmets on and we probably ended up that way.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember a pressure point problem.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|If there was, you'd move some way to avoid it.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|(The quality of the rest) was poor in my case.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I'd say the same thing.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|And for a lot of physical reasons that I mention (in the tech debrief, see below); and also, I'm sure, just the (problem of) getting unwound from the excitement of that day was contributing, too.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I guess I may have mentioned it before but, maybe again, it seems almost inconceivable that you can't afford to monitor two people. It seems a little hokey for a nation to be sending people to the Moon...
1145228|ALSJ||The following is a section of the Technical Debrief subtitled 'General Lunar Surface Fatigue'.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|I wasn't tired at all. I worked real hard at a high workload right there near the conclusion (of the EVA) when I was pulling the rock boxes up. We knew that was going to be hard, plus the fact that we were racing around a little bit towards the end, trying to get everything thrown into boxes and getting all the pieces put together. I expect my heart rate ran up pretty good right there (it peaked just below 160 beats per minute), but I had a lot of energy and reserve at that point, because we had been sort of taking it easy all through the EVA.
1145228|ALSJ||Prior to the final burst of activity, neither Neil nor Buzz had a workload comparable with those regularly undertaken by later crews. The purpose of the Apollo 11 EVA was to demonstrate that useful work could be done and grab a few samples; but, with the landing accomplished, their main job was to get home safely and there was no point in pushing limits and risking fatigue for the all-important launch and rendezvous.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|Everything was, with a few exceptions, accomplished with a comfortable workload. We didn't have to work hard throughout the whole timeline, and I knew I could afford to race around there for 5 or 10 minutes without jeopardizing the operation at all. They called for a status check (a veiled request that he slow down) and I gave them one and we proceeded, but there wasn't a problem with respect to available energy and reserve.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I think that the fact that you're well cooled off enables you to absorb a fair amount in an increase of activity before it manifests itself. The oxygen flow rate concerned me a little bit pre-flight because I found, in doing some fairly strenuous exercise in the thermal vacuum chamber, that the first indication I got was that there was not quite enough circulation of oxygen to breathe. It tended to get a little stuffy in the helmet. (Here, Buzz changes the subject to the workload involved in launch and rendezvous) I think all of us who have been through this business (in the simulators) know a good bit about the pace of activities following insertion (into lunar orbit), which is rather leisurely taken. However, you can get wrapped around the axle doing a lot of different things that aren't required (in a normal launch and rendezvous) - many of them are doing things just to say you can add more and more solutions. Therefore, to carry out a minimum-rendezvous effort is not, as I would see it, a very tiring task to look forward to after descent and a prolonged EVA. I think we would have been fully capable of carrying out a lift-off and rendezvous (right after the EVA, had one been required).
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|We handled one.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|You just are not going to get any sleep while you're waiting for it to be completed, but you're certainly not going to be completely bushed chasing yourself around the cockpit. With the automatic radar, lift-off and rendezvous are fairly leisurely exercises. I guess I'd have more concern about Mike's ability to continue, because he's quite active moving back and forth and doing a lot of manual tasks with the sextant that we didn't have to do.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|We cleaned up the cockpit and got things pretty well in shape. This took us a while, and we planned to sleep with our helmets and gloves on for a couple of reasons. One is that it's a lot quieter with your helmets and gloves on, and then we wouldn't have any mental concern about the ECS and so on having two loops working for us there.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|We wouldn't be breathing all that dust.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|That was another concern. Our cockpit was so dirty with soot, that we thought the suit loop (filtered oxygen going directly from the ECS to the suit and then back again) would be a lot cleaner.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I guess the question is: can you keep it cleaner? I guess you could keep it a little cleaner, but there are so many things going in and out that it's almost impossible to avoid getting a significant amount of lunar material in there.
1145228|ALSJ||The Apollo 12 crew had an even worse problem with dust and, for the remaining missions, the solutions that seemed to help were (1) dusting each other off as thoroughly as possible with a house-paint-sized brush before going up the ladder; (2) stomping their feet on the ladder to get more dust off the boots and lower legs; and (3) putting the suit legs into spare <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jettison bags</a> between the EVAs.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|A couple of comments with respect to going to sleep in the LM. One is that it's noisy; and two is that it's illuminated. We had the window shades up (that is, covering the windows) and light came through those window shades like crazy. They're like (photographic) negatives and a lot of light will shine through.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|You can't see what's going on outside, but you can come quite close to it.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|For example, you can see the horizon out there through the window shades. There's that much light that comes through.
1145228|ALSJ||There is no discussion of the window shades in the Apollo 11 Mission Report. However, the fact that none of the other crews reported problems with light coming in suggests that the shade design was modified to use a more opaque material.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|The next thing is that there are several warning lights that are very bright and can't be dimmed. The next thing is that there are all those radioactive illuminated display switches in there. Third, after I got into my sleep stage and all settled down, I realized that there was something else shining in my eye. It turned out to be that the Earth was shining through the AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope) right into my eye. It was just like a light bulb. If I had thought of that ahead of time, we could have put the Sun filter on or something that would have cut that light out.
1145228|ALSJ||As detailed on pages 9 and 10 in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf" target="alsj">Apollo Experience Report - Protection from Radiation</a>, the tips of the toggle switches in the LM cabin contained "microspheres of promethium-147 (2.6-year half-life) bound with a phosphor that produces light by interaction with the short-range promethium-147 beta radiation." The switch tips were made of Kel-F plastic. The microspheres were encapsulated in glass and then sealed with epoxy into a cylindrical hole the Kel-F switch tip. Paul Fjeld calls attention to a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM-Panel-Sept1968.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">1968 Grumman photo</a> showing a LM panel with the tips in place. The tips were removed from all the remaining LMs and simulators long before this paragraph was written in April 2011. Harald Kucharek calls attention to a 2009 <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/20090016336.pdf" target="alsj">briefing</a> by Michael Interbartolo (NASA JSC), indicating that the docking targets were also radioluminiscent.
1145228|ALSJ||The cabin temperature through the rest period was in the range of 61 to 62 degrees Fahrenheit or about 16 degrees Celsius.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|Yes. We fell victim to a time constant. Once we noticed it going bad, there wasn't anything we could do about it. In addition, because we were trying to minimize our activities and stay in some state of drowsiness, we didn't want to get up and start stirring around, because it would be that much harder to get back to that same state again. So we tried to minimize our activity. We underestimated how much light was coming in through the windows. There must have been a significant amount of light and heat coming in and just being reflected off the surface. We had no feel for what gas-flow setting we should have had. Because we'd been on the cooling all the time up to that point - while moving around (before the rest period) - I'm not sure that there's much (quick) control over that (meaning the temperature in the suit) anyway. We finally disconnected the oxygen flow.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|But that requires that you take your helmet off, so that you can breathe when you turn the suit disconnects (that is, shut off the flow from the ECS into the suits). This means that it gets noisy again, and all you hear is a glycol pump and stuff like that. This was a never-ending battle to obtain just a minimum level of sleeping conditions, and we never did. Even if we would have, I'm not sure I would have gone to sleep.
1145228|ALSJ||The following is from Section 9.10 in the Apollo 11 Mission Report: &quot:During the sleep period on the lunar surface, the crew reported that they were too cold to sleep. Analysis of the conditions experienced indicated that once the crew were in a cold condition, there was not enough heat available in the environmental control system to return them to a comfortable condition. Ground tests have indicated that in addition to the required procedural changes which are designed to maintain heat in the suit circuit, blankets will be provided and the crew will sleep in hammocks."
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know who was on Biomed at the time (it was Neil), but I feel that I did get a couple of hours maybe mentally fitful drowsing. I'll have to say that I think I had the better sleeping place. I found that it was relatively comfortable on the floor, either on my back with feet up against the side, or with my knees bent (and his feet on the floor, the cabin width being insufficient for him to stretch out). Also, I could roll over on one side or the other. I had the two OPSs stacked up at the front of the hatch, so there was ample room on the floor for one. But there wasn't room for two.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|To cut down on the light level, we're just going to have to do something with the window shades to make them more effective. I think sleeping with the helmet on will keep the cooling down and is probably a good, reasonable way to go as long as you're going to keep the suit on. Unless some change is made, we'd never even think about taking the suits off.
1145228|ALSJ|CMP|Apollo 12 is planning to take their suits off. With the longer stay-time and a couple of EVAs, they're planning to take their suits off.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|I think they ought to think a little more about it. I don't know what the temperature would be in there. I got the impression that it was a lot cooler outside the suit than it would have been inside. I don't feel that having the suit on in one-sixth g is that much of a bother. It's fairly comfortable. You have your own little snug sleeping bag, unless you have some pressure point somewhere. Your head in the helmet (which has a pad at the back of the head) assumes a very comfortable position. Even out of the helmet, you don't have to worry about what you're leaning against. Your head doesn't weigh that much, and will very comfortably pick just about any position. I just don't see the real need for taking the helmets off.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|I didn't mind sleeping on the engine cover. I didn't find it that bad. I made a hammock out of a waist tether - which I attached to some structure handholds - to hold my feet up in the air and in the middle of the cockpit. This kept my feet up about level with or a little higher than my torso.
1145228|ALSJ|LMP|Well, you were back out of the mainstream of the light, except for the AOT. I think we could fix that up and obtain a more horizontal position or the capability to roll from one side to the other. That's just something that has to be worked out. It wasn't satisfactory. If we had known then what we know now, we could have preconditioned the cabin a little bit better (in terms of temperature). We needed to start at a warmer level by turning the water off, thereby storing a small amount of heat.
1145228|ALSJ|CDR|That's just one of those areas that didn't occur to us. It clearly needs some more work.
1145228|ALSJ||Ultimately, the Apollo 12 crew decided not to take their suits off between the two EVAs. However, they took their helmets and gloves off, kept the flow of cooling water off, and slept in <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">hammocks</a>.
1145228|ALSJ||The Apollo 12 crew did not report any problems with noise, excess light, or cold temperatures keeping them from sleep. Neither of them slept more than three hours, but the brief sleep was due to a poor fit of Pete Conrad's suit that was causing him sufficient discomfort that he and Al Bean had to get up early and fix it. The Apollo 14 crew had the same sort of arrangements as the 12 crew but found that they had trouble getting their heads into comfortable positions, perhaps because of the rigid neckrings. In addition, their spacecraft had landed with a significant tilt and, when they were in a drowzy state, the tilt produced a sensation that the LM was about to tip over. That sensation kept them both awake. Starting with Apollo 15, the astronauts got out of their suits after each EVA and it made a world of difference. They were able to get comfortable in the hammocks and, on the whole, they slept soundly. Some of them felt more excitement about the situation than the others did and had trouble falling asleep but, all of them slept soundly for at least a few hours each rest period, and woke up refreshed and ready to go back to work. Neil and Buzz and the other early crews demonstrated the obvious - that it was possible to accomplish a great deal with limited rest. And the later crews demonstrated that simple additions to the equipment list - and confidence in the suit that let them take it off and put it back on three times - made it possible to get adequate rest at a small cost.
1205904|ALSJ||Astronaut Ron Evans takes over as CapCom and makes the wakeup call to Mike.
1210034|ALSJ||In a 2010 book, </i>From the Trench of Mission Control to the Craters of the Moon<i>, H. David Reed, who was Flight Dynamics Officer (FIDO) for the Apollo 11 LM liftoff, details the story behind this unscheduled request for a P22 one orbit before liftoff. Briefly, he and his support team needed an accurate LM position so they could pick a liftoff time that would minimize propellant usage. The various estimates available at that time were scattered over a considerable area. They needed something better. After extensive discussions within the team, Reed choose a method suggested by Pete Williams, the COMPUTER DYNAMICS officer: they would track the CSM with the LM's rendezvous radar and, then, using a separate, accurate determination of the CSM's orbital track over the landing site (as discussed at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1210737" target="alsj">121:07:37</a>), work backwards to find the LM.
1210034|ALSJ||In a June 2011 e-mail, Reed adds: "For Apollo 12 (and subsequent), as you know, we wanted to do a 'pin point' landing, which we had discovered would be impossible without a real fix in LM position before landing. This was accomplished by implementing a post DOI (Descent Orbit Insertion), doppler-tracking scheme devised by Emil Scheisser of MPAD (Mission Planning and Analysis division). The ground would compute the predicted downrange error and send that correction to the crew prior to powered descent ignition. It allowed us to land within a few hundred feet or less of the desired landing site."

1210737|ALSJ||John Young used this crater for tracking purposes during Apollo 10.
1210737|ALSJ||That is, Houston wants to be sure that they know Columbia's orbit in as much detail as possible. Tracking data from the Command Module on John Young's crater will help refine solutions to the Earth-based tracking data they have on the CSM. With an accurate CSM orbit in hand, the FIDO team will be able to determine the LM location with sufficient accuracy. At <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1222451" target="alsj">122:24:51</a>, Mike reports that he got five good marks (location determinations) on the crater.
1210737|ALSJ||The LM crew will track the Command Module as it passes over the landing site for the last time prior to launch and, with the Command Module orbit well known, in principle the tracking data will help pin down the landing site. At <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1235523" target="alsj">123:55:23</a>, about a half hour before liftoff, Ron gives Mike a final LM location of J.5/7.7, which is only about 200 meters from the actual landing site at J.65/7.54. Mike will be too busy during that pass over the landing site to look for the LM.
1214102|ALSJ||There were two waist tethers in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-lec.html" target="alsj">LEC-Waist Tether Kit</a>. The tethers were primarily intended for use during an EVA transfer to the CM, should that be necessary. The one Neil used to suspend his legs was not the one Buzz took outside and hooked to the porch rail for possible use as a lanyard. See a <a href="a11lbl5868LEC-Tether.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labeled detail from AS11-40-5868</a>, one of Neil's shots of Buzz coming down the ladder.
1214102|ALSJ||As it turns out, the waist tether that was among a number of <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11ReturnedEagleArtifacts.html" target="alsj">Eagle artifacts</a> Neil returned to Earth in the Apollo 11 Purse is the one Neil used to suspended his legs from the AOT guard during the rest period. A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11ReturnedEagleArtifacts.html#10" target="alsj">full discussion</a> includes the discovery of yellow paint flecks on the inside surface of the large hook on the returned tether that provides convincing evidence that the returned tether was the one Neil attached to the AOT guard.

1214114|ALSJ||See a discussion at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/#1210034" target="alsj">121:00:34</a>.
1214114|ALSJ||See Fred Martin's <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html" target="alsj">discussion</a> of this issue. He was a real time participant in the effort to understand the program alarms that occurred during the descent.
1214114|ALSJ|LMP|I was just arguing with him.
1214114|ALSJ||P22 is the program that uses the rendezvous radar to track the Command Module. P57 is the platform alignment program. Readers should note that, although some of the detail was a little fuzzy after 22 years, neither Neil nor Buzz hesitated in remembering the basic purpose of these programs.
1214114|ALSJ|CDR|My guess is that (P57) was the gravity align plus a star alignment.
1214114|ALSJ||While Neil and Buzz get themselves ready for the morning's activities, Houston will send up a new state vector. They are at the top of checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur48.gif" target="alsj">Sur-48</a>.
1214114|ALSJ||Neil and Buzz know the procedures and the likely variations that Houston could give them quite well and, knowing what Houston wants to do, can check to make sure that the changes make sense.
1214421|ALSJ||I asked about writing implements.
1214421|ALSJ|LMP|The one I liked to use was sort of a...It wasn't exactly a felt tip, but it was a composite. It seemed to flow out with a bit more ink than the Fisher (Space Pen). It just gave a bolder stroke.
1214421|ALSJ||The following changes refer to circuit breakers.
1214421|ALSJ||In response to a question from Journal Contributor Thomas Schwagmeier about the acronym AELD, Frank O'Brien writes, "The Ascent Engine Latching Device was the electronics assembly that controlled the sequencing of the explosive bolts for staging, and then ascent stage engine ignition. Because the need for reliability in the Ascent engine is so high (consider the bad day you would have if it shut down early and couldn't be restarted) the 'engine on' signal was 'latched'. The manual says it was a 'memory circuit' that maintained the engine-on signal in the event the automatic 'on' signal was lost. Engine shutdown was accomplished only by an explicit 'engine off' command by either an automatic (I'll assume this to be the PGNCS/AGS) shutdown command or a manual shutdown command." O'Brien suggests that the "memory circuit' "didn't look like any memory we think of today - most likely a flip-flop circuit."
1214421|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Phil Karn suggests that it may have been a "a good old-fashioned electromechanical relay. It'd be easy to wire the contacts to keep its own coil energized once it had been pulled in with a momentary 'on' pulse. I've actually been somewhat surprised at the number of electromechanical relays in Apollo systems given the inherent limits on their reliability. Perhaps at the time they were still considered more reliable than the early semiconductor ICs (Integrated Circuits) of the day."
1214602|ALSJ|LMP|The reason for that query may be that there are a lot of switches and a lot of circuit breakers with names which are the same. So what we did in the checklist was, wherever it came to a circuit breaker, we put '<a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-CB11.html" target="alsj">CB(11)</a>'. That meant it was on one side or the other (Neil's in the case of panel 11). So we knew what was going to happen afterwards, and that it was a circuit breaker. Because if it didn't say that (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LM-CB11.html" target="alsj">CB(11)</a> or CB(16)), then it was a switch. And we knew where the switch was on the panel. We got to that point through sufficient amount of confusion and 'Well, are we talking about the circuit breaker or the switch'? And it would have eased that if he (Evans) had said 'Circuit breaker such and such.' But, you know, that's kind of nitpicking."
1214602|ALSJ|LMP|That's like a window flag. You got to know the name of the game. Talkback is one or two indicators behind a window. In some cases they were red and in some cases they were striped; and, if it was neutral, usually it was gray.
1214602|ALSJ||That is, the window would show red or a red-stripe pattern to show a positive indication, and gray for a neutral indication.
1214602|ALSJ||The circuit breaker cards in the checklist show the desired status of the panels. A white dot on the card indicates that a breaker is supposed to be open, while a black dot indicates a breaker that is supposed to be closed.
1214602|ALSJ|LMP|We came up with this (idea of the circuit breaker cards). I don't think it was done on previous (flights)...maybe it was. But in all the damn things that were happening, occasionally you want a summary of where things are. So we printed a map of these and colored them in black or white, so you can just look along it. (If) you tried to use a (written) summary of where things ought to be and read 'em off while you're looking (at the panel), and looking and reading and...God, it's a mess! But, if you've got something like this, you can just look at it and see where the open ones are and go right along the row. But, when he (Evans) was reading up these changes of things, that was in the text, so you've got to correct the text and the card, too. Which just points out how updating checklists is a difficult thing to do. One of these days, I'm sure - if we're not there already - you get it done by a computer, or the computer will do both.
1214602|ALSJ|LMP|And, in retrospect, there are a lot of valves for which the switch (setting) is 'closed' or 'open'. It seems to me there are not too many that are 'in' and 'out'. So, a nomenclature of 'In' and 'Out' on circuit breakers might have been a little better description (than 'Open' or 'Closed'). Less confusion.
1214602|ALSJ||During the ascent, the tapemeter could show range and range rate based on data from either the PGNS (Primary Guidance and Navigation System) or the AGS (Abort Guidance System).
1214602|ALSJ|CDR|The same meter can show you altitude and altitude rate if it's on the landing radar.

1215121|ALSJ||Ron calls Mike at Command Module AOS.
1215818|ALSJ||Mike will activate small fans in the tanks to stir the contents. According to Gerry Griffin, as the tanks emptied in zero-g, the contents tended toward a "slush", a mixture of liquid oxygen (or hydrogen, depending on the tank in question) and gas. With the content in the slush state, Houston could not be sure of uniform flow out of the tank or of accurate measurements of the amount of oxygen remaining. By stirring the contents with a fan, they homogenized the mixture and got both more uniform flow and better gauge readings.
1215818|ALSJ||The self-test is a routine that checks to see that memory in the LM Guidance computer is in the proper configuration for launch.
1215818|ALSJ||They are on checklist page <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur48.gif" target="alsj">Sur-48</a>, near the middle of the page.
1215818|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien writes, "At this point, Buzz is performing an alignment of the LM's inertial platform. Rather than the traditional Program 52, which requires sighting two stars through the AOT, Program 57 is used. All platform alignments require determining the exact position of two references is space, which is all that is necessary to determine the platforms orientation to any reference. Normally, stars are used as the references, as they combine the necessary quality of being in fixed, well-defined locations in the sky. Program 57 does use one star for its orientation, but the fact the LM is on the surface allows the platform to use another well understood reference: the gravity field of the moon. Thus, performing a fix on a star, and sensing the gravity vector for its second directional reference supplies all the information necessary for the computer to align the platform to a known orientation."
1215818|ALSJ||Using gravity to help align the platform is not a radical concept, and a variation known as gyrocompassing is used on the Command Module before launch. Because this is the first lunar landing, engineers are especially eager to see how well gravity alignments perform on the Moon. The procedure Buzz uses requires him to enter a Verb 32 to 'recycle' Program 57, allowing him to preserve some of the data previously entered, and start the program from the beginning. Recycling saves time, and allows the engineers on the ground time to observe the performance of the alignment. If the data shows something is amiss in Program 57, it can be terminated, and the familiar Program 52 alignment is used.
1215818|ALSJ||In his next transmission, Buzz's 'Verb 604' is a informal contraction of the sequence Verb 06 Noun 04 (appearing as the line '06 04 +____ Gravity Err(or) Angle' near the top of page <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11sur50.gif" target="alsj">Surf-50</a>), which is a request to show the difference between the platforms orientation and that which was calculated by the gravity alignment."
1215818|ALSJ|LMP|On P57 before lift-off, the Sun moved up in the field-of-view, as did all the rest of the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11StarCharts.html" target="alsj">stars</a>. The Earth stayed the same. The Earth obscured the forward <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html" target="alsj">detent</a> and the right detent. The Sun was now in the rear detent, and for some reason, it also obscured the left-rear detent, which was the one I was counting on using with Rigel. This was the one we had used before. I was quite surprised to discover this. The Sun was not within more than 15 degrees of the total field-of-view. It completely obscured the left-rear detent. It effectively left us two out of the six detents to pick stars from. Looking at those two detents, there weren't any stars near the center. The closer to the center you get (that is, the closer to the center the star you sight on is), the greater the accuracy is. The day before, we had used Navi, and it wasn't particularly bright. So I went back, and now used Capella, but it was fairly close to the edge of the field-of-view."
1215818|ALSJ||The star known as <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html" target="alsj">Navi</a> was named for Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom. Navi is Ivan spelled backwards.
1215818|ALSJ|LMP|So we did a gravity, one-star alignment and that first gravity alignment came up with 00010. Verb 32 gave us 00001. We used a sequence of markings that involved an onboard averaging of five successive cursor readings, followed by depressing the Mark button, and then five successive spiral readings that Neil would log down as I would read them off. Then he would average these up and we would put them in. We'd use either spiral or cursor first, which ever appeared to be convenient. I think this averaging technique worked out better than letting the computer do it, because it would have amounted to a considerable rotating of the spiral-and-cursor reticle field back and forth to make one spiral, then a cursor, then a spiral, and do a recycle. There is the option, however, to do one or the other. This was a REFSMMAT alignment. The torquing angles were fairly large (that is, the indicated change in orientation of the inertial platform). The star-angle difference was 00007 (0.7 degrees difference between the measured position of the star and the location expected based on the platform alignment) which, pre-flight, was the expected value of a two-star alignment. Torquing angles were very close to 0.7 in all three axes, which indicated that the platform did drift a fair amount during that time period (since the last alignment performed prior to EVA Prep).

1222035|ALSJ||Verb 83 is not a step listed in the Surface Checklist. Buzz did his Ph.D. Thesis on orbital rendezvous and was extremely knowledgeable about the guidance programs and procedures. This suggestion to Houston is an indication of the depth of his knowledge.
1222451|ALSJ||Houston has enough good radar tracking data and doesn't need any more.
1222451|ALSJ|LMP|I had hoped (during the P22) to use the AGS to tell me where the Command Module was; but, unfortunately, we didn't update the AGS with the latest PGNS state vector, so it wasn't giving us good range and range rate. I would recommend doing that, if anyone does a P22 in the future, because you can't use the PGNS to tell you what the range and the range rate are. And you can't use the radar because it's not going to lock on until it gets to 400 miles (possibly because of a too-weak return). But the <a href=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> gives you very good indications as you are approaching that range. So we were a little misled and I thought we were still out of range when we finally got the lock-on. You call up the program before the Command Module gets to 400 miles. It sits and waits; and, when it gets less than 400, it locks on automatically, and you see the signal strength grow and it starts to track. But it's in mode 2, so you don't see the needles doing anything; the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html#xpoint" target="alsj">cross-pointers</a> move, indicating it's got rate drive going as it's trying to keep up with it. Because we didn't want to run the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-Tapemeters.html" target="alsj">tapemeter</a> into the stops, we left it in Altitude/Altitude Rate. We really didn't have much of an indication that any good information was coming in, other than signal strength. I guess the ground got the data on the downlink. When it broke lock, I thought the Command Module was overhead and (that) it had broken lock because of a maximum rate drive. The radar representative from RCA had indicated that the spec (that is, the radar system specifications) said it might break lock, but he didn't think it would as it went over the zenith. But, because of the AGS indications, I thought that was what had caused the break-lock. Evidently, it had gone out the front field-of-view. (Here, Buzz is mistaken. As Evans indicated at 122:24:57, they shouldn't have lost lock because of range until 122:29:35. For some other reason, they lost lock at 122:24:09.) It broke lock just a short time after the time given us by the ground for the zenith passage, so I was fully expecting to acquire it again. I don't think we had our AGS configured (properly) and the ground was not as helpful as they might have been had we run this sort of thing previously in simulations and had a bit more training on it."

I don't have time to go through the code, but I suspect it is used to see whether the LM state vector needs to be updated or not - or is updated only with the rotation of the moon." Verb 44 sets the surface flag, presumably to indicate that the LM is on the lunar surface. Verb 45 resets the flag to indicate that the LM is in flight.

What's sensed is the pressure/temperature ratio of the helium tank used to pressurize the propellants, which is directly proportional to the mass of the gas remaining in the helium tank. Knowing how much helium was in the system to start with, that gives the mass of helium in the propellant tanks. The propellant-tank pressure is regulated, so that gives helium volume in the propellant tanks. Finally, knowing the tank volume, that gives remaining propellant volume, shown as a percentage."

One prominent candidate is a multi-crater feature named before the flight as the Cat's Paw. See section 4.5.4 in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Photogrammetry.html" target="alsj">2011 photogrammetric analysis</a> of the Apollo 11 site for a discussion of these western horizon features and their identification with a crater 200 m in diameter and its near rim 200 m from the LM.

The near rim of the Cat's Paw doesn't appear in the film until about 52 seconds after ignition.
1242206|ALSJ||Neil seems to be saying that he can see mountains downtrack from their current location. However, that interpretation doesn't seem consistent with their current location and altitude. Apollo 11 photo <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-41-6121HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS11-41-6121</a> shows a view more or less along the ascent ground track but taken from much higher altitude. The two prominent craters of the right are Sabine (right center) and Ritter (right). Both have diameters of about 30 km and depths of about 1.3 km. Two parallel rilles run WNW from the lower left toward the center of the image and end just south of Sabine. The rilles point toward toward Schmidt Crater (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/../a410/AS10-34-5162HR.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AS10-34-5162</a>), which has a diameter of 11 km and a depth of 2.3 km. As can be seen in a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11AscentTerrain.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">composite</a> made from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#A11DesMonChrt3A-1" target="alsj">Ascent Monitoring Chart, Sheet 3, Parts 1 and 2</a> and the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc" target="alsj">LROC WMS Image Map</a>, the nearest 'mountains' west of the landing site are some elevations at about longitude 19.7 E south of Sabine, and some substantial peaks and ridges at about 16.5 E. The landing site is at about 23.5 E.
1242206|ALSJ||PAO tells us that Eagle is currently at an altitude of 0.3 km (1000 feet). From that height, the horizon is about 1.0 degree west of the LM or a longitude of 22.5 E. Any feature beyond that point will be visible only if it is higher than a minimum altitude which increases with distance west. The hills south of Sabine are 2.8 degrees west of the current horizon and would be visible only if they were taller than 2.8 km; the substantial peaks near 16.5 E, would have to be about twice the height of the most prominent mountains elsewhwere on the Moon. Neither seems plausible. Comparing the shadowing of the features south of Sabine with the shadows in both Ritter and Sabine, the features south of Sabine aren't tall enough to be visible from the LM at 0.3 km altitude. Clearly, Neil isn't seeing any 'mountains' out in front from an altitude of 0.3 km. However, within a minute, they will be up to 2.7 km (9000 feet) and, even neglecting their forward motion, will have a horizon about 3 degrees out in front. By that time, Neil might be able to see the hills south of Sabine peeking over the horizon.
1242206|ALSJ||Buzz has a chart in front of him that gives the desired relationships between time, horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and, less importantly, altitude. As long as they gain sufficient horizontal velocity and get high enough to clear the highest lunar mountains, they will achieve lunar orbit. If they are a bit higher or lower than planned, the orbit can be adjusted with a short burn of the RCS at an appropriate time to ensure rendezvous.
1242432|ALSJ||H-dot is the vertical velocity, the time derivative of altitude. At this point, they achieve their maximum climb rate. The planned initial orbit is a 10 mile by 45 mile ellipse and, at engine shutoff, lunar gravity will have slowed H-Dot to about 30 feet per second.
1242432|ALSJ||Prior to construction of the Interstate Highway System, U.S. 1 was the main north-south route along the east coast of the United States. In his book, <i>Men from Earth</i>, Buzz makes the following comment concerning the flight of Apollo 10. "The glaring Sun was behind Tom (Stafford) and Gene (Cernan) as they flew backwards (landing legs first) above the lunar equator towards the west. With their windows parallel to the surface, they could photograph landmarks along the approach to the Sea of Tranquility landing site." One of these landmarks is a pair of east-west rilles - Rimae Hypatia - just to the left (south) of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11AscentTerrain.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">ascent ground track</a>. Sometime before Apollo 11, the astronauts started calling the longer, more southerly of the pair "U.S. 1" and the shorter, more northerly rille "Wagon Road". See a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-41-6121HR-lbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">labelled version of AS11-41-6121</a>, taken from the Command Module sometime after the LM returned to lunar orbit.
1242432|ALSJ||When they pass Schmidt Crater, they will have two minutes left in the burn. AFJ Editor David Woods has provided a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_1242629NoiseRreduction.mp3" title="audio clip" target="alsj">brief, noise-reduced audio clip</a> and suggested changing my original transcription to "Coming up on Schmidt (garbled)."
1242432|ALSJ||Neil's view to the right is blocked by LM structure over the forward hatch. We get a good <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11ascent16mm0503.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">view into Schmidt</a> in the DAC film shot out Buzz's window.
1242432|ALSJ||The computers agree on the velocity left to be gained before they are in the desired orbit.
1242834|ALSJ||Buzz will shut off the feed of Ascent fuel to the RCS systems.
1242923|ALSJ||They will use the RCS to refine their orbit by making three-axis velocity corrections to exactly the desired values. Public Affairs reports that they are in a 9.1 by 47.2 nautical-mile orbit.
1243123|AFJ||Having just queried the PGNCS about the size of their orbit, Buzz has asked the AGS for its determination. PGNCS: 47.3 by 9.5 nautical miles (87.6 by 17.6 km). AGS: 46.6 by 9.5 (86.3 by 17.6 km). The two systems with their independent gyros and accelerometers are in remarkable agreement.
1243409|AFJ||The PAO has slipped up in saying Spider, the code-name of the Apollo 9 LM, when he means Columbia, the Apollo 11 CM.
1245724|AFJ||These are angles to which the steerable dish antenna can be aimed in an effort to improve communications.
1250557|AFJ||The ground's computation of the CSI maneuver is 51.5 feet per second (15.7 m/s) which, as Neil will reveal on the onboard recording, equals the solution in the LM.
1253057|AFJ||Most of the noise we associate with a rocket engine is produced by the violent and turbulent interaction of the exhaust gases with the atmosphere through which they flow. However, in the LM, the gases are expelled straight into a vacuum. What little noise comes up
1253738|AFJ||This appears to be a water leak, mentioned later at 126:13:01.
1254322|AFJ||Armstrong is referring to Gene Cernan's Lunar Module Snoopy, on Apollo 10.
1255836|AFJ||Aldrin means the Earth rising over the horizon, and he is asking whether a laser was being fired at the Moon as part of an experiment also undertaken earlier in the mission. It would be used to target the reflector they had left on lunar surface the previous day.
1265304|AFJ||Mox nix is attributed to the German idiom, macht nichts, meaning 'it doesn't matter'.
1280522|AFJ||Apollo 11 has re-emerged from the far side of the Moon on the 27th orbit as a single docked spacecraft, no longer using the separate call signs of Columbia and Eagle.
1284543|AFJ||The CM docking probe will not be needed after the LM is jettisoned, so they plan to abandon it inside the Eagle and save weight for Columbia's return journey to Earth.
1291258|AFJ||Armstrong is allowing Collins a quick look at the Contingency Sample, the first small bag of lunar soil he collected on the surface. He scooped this up and put it in a pocket, in case he and Aldrin had to depart quickly. Although he did not reach the surface, Collins becomes the third human being to get a close-up look at lunar soil. Armstrong's last comment appears to be an instruction not to open a different bag of samples.
1291326|AFJ||At this point Collins possibly makes a remark, not picked up by the onboard recorder, about the gray color of the lunar samples. That would elicit the following ironic wit from Armstrong.
1292947|AFJ||Armstrong and Aldrin finally leave Eagle and rejoin Collins in Columbia. Mission Control's next call to Eagle, when Apollo 11 reappears from the far side of the Moon, erroneously assumes Eagle is still crewed.
1295720|AFJ||An hour ago at 128:58 they planned to perform the LM jettison at 131:52, so they now expect to do it about 1 hour, 20 minutes ahead of the plan.
1301911|AFJ||No longer having two separate manned spacecraft, the different CM and LM call-signs are no longer needed. However, CapCom had got used to using them.
1304955|AFJ||This is one of many examples of Collins' quick wit. 'All the News That's Fit to Print' is the motto of the New York Times, and it appears on the newspaper's front page.
1310846|AFJ||Armstrong and Aldrin, having worn their space suits continually since leaving Columbia the previous day, have now removed them. Collins had put his back on for the docking and is still wearing it. They will all undertake the Trans-Earth Injection engine firing without suits on.
1311001|AFJ||Collins is asking about the troublesome spirit level bubble on the Passive Seismic Experiment which Aldrin deployed on the lunar surface.
1334538|AFJ||Apollo 11 is now about to reappear from behind the Moon on its 30th lunar orbit. They crew have stowed their equipment and received from Mission Control the necessary data to perform the Trans-Earth Injection engine firing which will send them homeward. That event is now about 1 hour and 40 minutes away, and they have little to do but wait.
1362140|AFJ||Jay Greene was one of NASA's premier Flight Controllers and had earlier been FIDO (Flight Dynamics Officer, or FDO) for the descent and landing of Eagle. He was the Flight Director for the Space Shuttle Challenger during its disastrous ascent in 1986.
1365252|AFJ||The aircraft carrier USS Hornet is due to pick Apollo 11 up in the Pacifc Ocean after splashdown.
1371737|AFJ||Armstrong's estimate is a little short, which is unsurprising due to the difficulty of judging distances on the lunar surface. As indicated by Vlad Pustynski's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11Photogrammetry.html" target="new">photogrammetric mapping for the Apollo 11 site</a>, the PSE was emplaced about 24 metres [80 feet] from the main body of the LM descent stage, at the 9.30 o'clock postion, where the LM's straight forward orientation is 12 o'clock.
1380152|AFJ||Owen Garriot of the Purple Team has taken over as CapCom from Charlie Duke of the White Team.
1380824|AFJ||Now safely coasting towards Earth, the exhausted crew of Apollo 11 can finally sleep soundly and will remain out of radio contact for almost 10 hours. Mission Control continues to monitor the spacecraft systems, of course, and the astronauts can be woken up if the situation requires it.
1474731|AFJ||These are the crew sleep hours, in the running order Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin.
1480158|AFJ||The sternal leads come from biomedical sensors postioned over the sternum, or breastbone.
1480731|AFJ||Phil Shaffer was FIDO on Cliff Charlesworth's Green Team though with the staff movements made for the landing, his position is being taken by Dave Reed at this time.
1480758|AFJ||In his autobiography, Mike tells how Shaffer struggled to explain to non-technical journalists what the concept of crossing the equigravisphere actually meant. At this point, the trajectory experts would change the reference for their calculations from Moon-centered to Earth-centered and, due to the relative speeds of these two objects, there would be a jump in stated velocities. Apparently some journalists were convinced there must be a physical jump felt by the crew, a nonsense that crews played with throughout the Apollo programme.
1482313|AFJ||Wilbur 'Weeb' Ewbank (1907-1998) was coach at the New York Jets football team from 1963 to 1973. Wally Lemm (1919-1988) was his counterpart at the Houston Oilers.
1490417|AFJ||Mission Control is referring to a water leak incident discussed at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/19day6-rendezvs-dock.html#1253738" target="new">125:37:38</a>, and mentioned again at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/19day6-rendezvs-dock.html#1261301" target="new">126:13:01</a>, in Day 6, part 2.
1514128|AFJ||When Neil refers to the EASEP, it sounds more like PSEP and he may be referring specifically to the seismometer whose official name is the Passive Seismic Experiment. The crater visited by Armstrong is now generally referred to as either Little West crater because of its proximity to West crater, or as East crater because it lies to the east of the landed LM.
1535359|AFJ||Apollo 11 is now about 7 hours into Flight Day 7 and accelerating towards Earth. The crew are continuing to have a quiet day and are about to begin preparations for a television broadcast.
1552326|AFJ||The Mars fly-by mission mentioned was one of the pair Mariner 6 or Mariner 7. At this time, 22 July, Mariner 6 was 9 days away from Mars encounter, and Mariner 7 was about 14 days away. With Mars looming ever larger in their cameras, these missions were being closely monitored prior to the intense activity of Mars encounter.
1553642|AFJ||The Eidophor was a television projector used to make large images on a screen. They were in use from the 1950s until the 1990s and NASA had one in Mission Control.
1553742|AFJ||CapCom Charlie Duke has confused the Moon with the Earth in the TV monitor, and is also referring to the continuing uncertainty about where Eagle actually landed. It will only be resolved after their return to Earth.
1554243|AFJ||CapCom appears to mistakenly think that Armstrong has the TV camera.
1554324|AFJ||Buzz handles a wrapped food cube.
1554935|AFJ||Collins breaks the spoonful of water, which was held together by surface tension, into flying globules and catches some in his mouth. He then gets out the water spigot with attached hose.
1555853|AFJ||There were several telecommunications satellites of the Intelsat 3 type. Intelsat 3 F-5 is the one in question, which was launched on 26 July 1969 and was left in an unstable orbit due to a third stage malfunction in the launcher. NASA PAO chose to include the Delta PAO feed into the Apollo 11 feed for the press.
1595202|AFJ||Before interpreting this Entry PAD, an explanation of some of the terminology may be useful. The first important concept is that of Entry Interface, a completely arbitrary event which is defined as the time when the spacecraft (by then only the Command Module) reaches an altitude of 400,000 feet (65.83 nautical miles, 121.92 km). It is chosen as it is easily calculated from the spacecraft's current state vector and does not depend on the vagaries of the atmosphere.
1602545|AFJ||With the crew of Apollo 11 in their second last sleep period before splashdown, the spacecraft continues to function extremely well, now overseen by the Black Team of Flight Controllers.
1733642|AFJ||Romania was a communist country at this time, but somewhat renegade in voicing some differences from the USSR and seeking to culitvate independent relations with the West.
1733829|AFJ||As of July 2009, Module McGhee is living in Columbus, Georgia. She is a mother and a special education teacher, and apparently loves her unusual name. She was mentioned in Norman Mailer's "Of A Fire on the Moon", 1970.
1734751|AFJ||Janice or Jan Aldrin was Buzz's 11-year-old daughter. She is now married as Janice Aldrin Schuss and her recollections of the moon landing are recounted in First on the Moon: What It Was Like When Man Landed on the Moon, by Barbara Hehner, Hyperion, 1999.
1740005|AFJ||Earlier Mike read a series of voltages to Garriott. Mission Control has converted those voltages to temperatures for the RCS engines. For these readings 0V to 5V represents a range from -50&deg;F to +50&deg;F, 100&deg;F overall. The lowest voltage reading was 4.5V and since 1V represents 20&deg;F, this reading must represent 10&deg;F below the maximum, or 40&deg;F.
1750739|AFJ||Launch was of course on July 16.
1762721|AFJ||After a relaxed morning, the crew of Apollo 11 have been up for about 6 hours, and are now preparing for the final TV transmission of the flight.
1775630|AFJ||c.g. = centre of gravity.
1791613|AFJ||At this point, the PAO audio feed switches to coverage of the launch of a Delta rocket carrying the Intelsat 3 satellite. The launch does not go ahead and PAO returns to coverage of the Apollo 11 mission.
1802345|AFJ||The contents of these tapes are reproduced above.
1812742|AFJ||Collins was speculating that the unfamiliar voice who has taken over as CapCom from Bruce McCandless might be Ken Mattingly or Owen Garriott, both of whom share duties at the CapCom console with McCandless. In fact it is Chuck Lewis, who was Assistant Flight Director to Gene Kranz on the White Team.
1820447|AFJ||The PAO announcer is mistaken in the duration off the rest period. It is 7 hours, not 10 and their wake up time is scheduled at 189 hours.
1820816|AFJ||This concludes the transcript for flight day 8 and the subsequent overnight period. The journal continues with crew wake-up on their last day in space.
1902236|AFJ||'In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)' was written by Rick Evans in 1964 and became a hit for Zager and Evans, a musical duo from Nebraska, in July 1969.
1903142|AFJ||These numbers are the crew's report on their sleep hours, in the order CDR, CMP, LMP.
1930232|AFJ||Another example of Jim Lovell's teasing humour.
1930253|AFJ||The mice will be used to test the toxicity of lunar soil samples.
1933133|AFJ||BEF - Blunt end forward. The correct orientation for the Command Module during re-entry, and another piece of astronaut humour.
1941032|AFJ||According to a list of <a href="http:/www.nasm.si.edu/events/apollo11/reliveapollo11/cast.cfm" target="new">key Apollo 11 personnel</a> on the website of the National Air &amp; Space Museum, the pilot of Swim 1 was Donald Richmon.
1942457|AFJ||Collins has carried out the horizon check ten minutes early. It should have been 194:33:06.
1943507|AFJ||Meaning manually set camera at f:16 aperture and 1/250th of a second shutter speed.
1951818|AFJ||In the movie &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; (2006), Mike Collins recalled: &quot;I can remember the beautiful water. We were out in the deep ocean in the Pacific. It was such a startling violet color. I remember looking at the ocean and admiring: 'nice ocean you've got here planet Earth'.&quot;
1951818|AFJ||Television pictures show President Richard M. Nixon approaching the Mobile Quarantine Facility on the hangar deck of the USS Hornet, where he has been waiting to greet the astronauts. The crew, now without their Biological Isolation Garments and masks, appear at the window of the cabin, as a curtain is opened. They speak with the President by microphone.
1951818|AFJ||National anthem plays.
1951818|AFJ||This concludes the Apollo 11 Flight Journal.
