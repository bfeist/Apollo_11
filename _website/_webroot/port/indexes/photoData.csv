Journal Contributor James Hill notes that the bottom of the first stage seems to be engulfed in the hot exhaust. Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld writes, "It's called 'plume recirculation.' Because the F-1 nozzles are underexpanded for that altitude, a very small bit of the escaping burn mass actually goes forward from the lip of the nozzle. Because there are neighbor nozzles doing the same thing there is even more pinging 'upwards.' Couple that with a suction behind the detached part of the supersonic shock wave forming on the side of the S1-C stage and you get that dirty fire creeping up the rocket. It was expected and protected against. You can see the same phenomenon on shuttle launches just before the solids kick off - it looks like the bottom of the External Tank is on fire!" 16 July 1969.

I was stationed at console BE-17 with call sign C2HU. This was the SII LH Propellant Tanking Computer System, the controller that kept the LH level at the correct Flight Mass specified for the mission. It simply monitored the level through a capacitance probe and added LH as the LH evaporated following the filling by the Propellants section and through pressurization, after which there was no boil off. Our section was an Elec section working alongside the Mechs who managed the tank farms and overall propellant handling. (In the photo), I am standing ( <a href="a11JCroley.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">128k</a> on the edge of the A level in front of the A level consoles (the side away from the window).

Deke Slayton, in a dark shirt with no tie, is six from the right in the second row, and Alan Shepard is next but one to Slayton's right. Kipp Teague notes that the clocks on the wall show Local (time) 10:25, Projected Launch (time) 9:32, and Accumulated Hold 12:00 (meaning 'none'.

0823247|AS11-40-5846|AS11-42-6304HR.jpg|View of Mare Fecunditatis from Armstrong's window. The two craters close together in the middle distance are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_(crater)" target="new" </a>Messier and Messier A</a>, with light-colored rays extending westward from Messier A, the more distant of the two. Apollo 11 photo <a href="AS11-42-6304HR.jpg" title="image" target="new">AS11-42-6304</a> shows the pair from overhead. Taruntius P is partially hidden behind the RCS thruster. Taruntius K is the slightly smaller crater further north. Taruntius H is the prominent crater west of K. These crater look relatively fresh. Taruntius K has a diameter of about 6 kilometers and has a raised rim. Section 4.1.1 in the Lunar Source Book indicates that a fresh crater of this size will have a depth (iincluding the rim) of about 1.2 km. The average inner slope is, then, about 22 degrees. The crater is undoubtedly bowl shaped, so the slope immediately inside the rim is considerably steeper than 22 degrees. During the Rev 4 pass over the foreground craters, the Sun's elevation was about 29 degrees, low enough to have produced a significant shadow inside the eastern rim but not reaching the center of the crater. The only other time prior to the landing when the crew would have had time to take this picture was on the Rev 5 pass. The Sun was a degree higher on that pass, still low enough to produce the inner shadow.

Scan courtesy NASA Johnson. Landing Site 2 is located just right of center at the very edge of the terminator. Crater Maskelyne is the large one at the lower right, with Maskelyne B directly beyond. Hypatia Rille (U.S. Highway Number One) is at upper left, with the crater Moltke just to the right (north) of it. Sidewinder Rille and Diamondback Rille extend from left to right across the center of the picture. Maskelyne and Maskelyne B have a diameter of almost 24 and 9 km respectively, and the distance from the crater center of Maskelyne to the Apollo 11 landing site is about 210 km. While Moltke is a relatively small crater, with a diameter of merely 6.5 km, its very light ejecta blanket makes it easy to find for Earth-based observers with moderately sized telescopes, making it a popular landmark for locating Station Tranquillitatis. Research by Danny Caes. Compare with a Starry Night view ( <a href="A11-03d22h50m.jpg" title="image" target="new">0.2Mb</a> ) of the area at the same time 5437 was taken. When I wrote a version of this caption sometime between 2 October 2008 and 27 April 2009, I thought this image was taken at about 94:50:00, when Buzz told Houston, &quot:Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out most all of the features we've identified previously.&quot:. I didn't start using JPL Horizons until September 2009 and, until July 2012, hadn't checked the solar elevation at Tranquility Base at 94:50:00. It was 6.6 degrees, much too high to have put the terminator in its 5437 location. During my re-evaluation of this sequence of photos, I looked through the on-board transcripts recently added to the <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/13day4-eagle-checkout.htm" target="new">Apollo 11 Flight Journal</a> for Day 4, including time Neil and Buzz spent in Eagle. At 82:56:25, Buzz tells Neil and Mike, &quot;I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.&quot; At this time, the solar elevation at Tranquility is only 0.6 degrees, which would put the terminator about 0.6 degrees of longitude west of the landing site. In the <a href="A11LBL5437.jpg" title="image" target="new">labeled version of 5437</a>we see that the terminator is at about the location of Crater Sabine C which is, indeed, 0.6 degrees west of Tranquility Base.

The crater directly to the right of the CSM has been named Collins following the Apollo 11 mission. The crater Aldrin is in the top right corner of this image. The third crater named in honor of the Apollo 11 crew, Armstrong, would be to the lower right of this photo and cannot be seen here. During the Apollo 11 mission, the craters Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins were still referred to as Sabine E, D and B respectively, with Sabine C being the crater that forms a triangle with B and D in this photo.

1001353|AS11-37-5448|AS11-37-5448HR.jpg|CSM separation sequence. The CSM can be seen near the center of the image, with the sharp-rimmed crater Schmidt directly right of it. The crater part in the lower right corner is the western part of Sabine, and the partially visible rim at the right edge of the image belongs to Ritter. This is the last photo taken from the LM prior to the powered descent, and eventually the landing one orbit later.

Mike Collins has begun a visual inspection of the Lunar Module, and is verifying that the landing gear is down and locked. An evolution in the LM's design is also apparent. The RCS plume deflectors, mounted on the Descent Stage underneath each RCS quad, were added to prevent the thermal damage observed on the Apollo 9 LM. Compare this photograph with that of the Apollo 10 LM ( <a href="as10_34_5085.jpg" title="image" target="new">AS10-34-5085</a> ), which was flown without plume deflectors. Scan by NASA Johnson.

1024532|AS11-40-5921|AS11-40-5921HR.jpg|110:48:05 Buzz took this photo of the area under the Descent Stage to document the effects of the engine plume. A radial pattern of scouring is readily visible. Note the gouge made by the probe hanging down from the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> (south) strut at contact. The fact that the spacecraft landed directly over this gouge mark is a clear indication that, as is discussed after 102:45:32, the LM was drifting left (south) during the final moments of the landing.

1093053|AS11-40-5850|AS11-40-5850HR.jpg|109:30:53 First EVA picture. Neil's first frame in a pan taken west of the ladder. <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">Jettison bag</a> under the Descent Stage, south footpad, bent probe, strut supports. The view is more or less up-Sun, so we are seeing the shadowed faces of boulders. 20 July 1969.

1093102|AS11-40-5852|AS11-40-5852HR.jpg|Rightward from 5851, with little overlap. Cross-Sun to the south. This frame is from Neil's initial pan taken from near the bottom of the ladder. This frame shows the older, eastern component of the double crater below Neil's LM window. This crater is about 10 meters across. It's western half is overlain by a younger, 12-m crater. See, also, David Harland's assembly of the <a href="a11_5847-8_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new">Pre-EVA Double Crater</a> view out Neil's window. 20 July 1969.

A <a href="a11det5848vs5853.jpg" title="image" target="new">comparison of details</a> from this frame with a detail from the corresponding view out Neil's window in 5848 indicates that the crater is relatively close to the LM.
1093111|AS11-40-5854|AS11-40-5854HR.jpg|Rightward of 5853, showing the down-Sun view along the LM shadow with boulders on the local horizon.

Note, also, the split boulder on the right that is partially shadowed by the LM.
1093116|AS11-40-5855|AS11-40-5855HR.jpg|Rightward of 5854. Note the sharp-rimmed crater on the horizon at the far right. This crater is to the right beyond the TV camera, on a continuation of the line from the US flag to the TV camera, in AS11-37- <a href="images11.html#5516" target="new">5516</a>.
1093120|AS11-40-5856|AS11-40-5856HR.jpg|Rightward of 5855, with the small, sharp-rimmed crater centered on the local horizon. Note an additional small crater to the right, which can be seen above the upper thruster in AS11-37- <a href="images11.html#5515" target="new">5515</a>.

1093130|AS11-40-5858|AS11-40-5858HR.jpg|Rightward of 5857, showing the plus-Y (north) footpad. The probe is flat on the ground pointing north, the MESA is at the right edge of the photo. Note the detailed radial sweep pattern created in the foreground by the descent engine exhaust.
1093140|AS11-40-5859|AS11-40-5859HR.jpg|View toward the south past the ladder. A comparison with 5850 indicates that Neil has moved north away from the spot near the foot of the ladder from which he took his initial pan. The image is blurred, indicating that Neil may have hurried the shot. The west footpad is in shadow but there is reasonable definition of the lower portion of the ladder. A 2010 <a href="a11Photogrammetry.html" target="new">photogrammetric analysis</a> by Vlad Pustynski indicates that Neil moved 3.9 meters north.
1093145|AS11-40-5860|AS11-40-5860HR.jpg|Similar to 5859 but not as badly blurred. View toward the south showing the ladder and the <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jettison bag</a>.

1093607|AS11-37-5505|AS11-37-5505HR.jpg|The black shadow of the LM is silhouetted against the Moon's surface in this photograph taken out Neil's window. Impressions in the lunar soil made by the lunar boots of the two astronauts are clearly visible. Journal Contributor AwE130 has provided an <a href="a11det5505AwE130.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced detail</a> which shows the Contingency Sample Collector (CSC) ring, which had been previously identified in EVA photo AS11-40-5864 by the Eric Jones. In the 5505 detail, we see a light-colored "&quot;stem&quot; on the outside of the ring which, as is suggested by the comparison with pre-flight photo <a href="../tools/tools09.jpg" title="image" target="new">S68-54939</a>, fit in the Sampler handle to secure the ring in place. Journal Contributor Karl Dodenhoff has provided a photo of a CSC on display at the Kennedy Space Center. The base of the stem is marked.

AwE130 notes that the ring can also be seen in post-EVA photos AS11-39-5798-5800 and in EVA photo AS11-40-<a href="#5871" target="new">5871</a>. Note that, because this image was taken out Neil's window, we now realize that that the ring flew a few meters from the spot near the MESA, on the other side of the spacecraft, where we see Neil tossing the ring in 16-mm film shot out Buzz's window. See a discussion following 109:36:07

Neil turned to his right to take this photo while waiting for Buzz to get farther out of the cabin. A <a href="a11det5864.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> shows what may be the contingency sampler ring. See, however, the discussion following 109:36:07.
1093957|AS11-40-5862|AS11-40-5862HR.jpg|109:39:57 First photo of Buzz coming out through the hatch. The inward-opening hatch is on his left. Buzz is kneeling, probably with his hands on the <a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new">midstep</a>. We can see his heels, the lower portion of his PLSS and his left arm. Elsewhere in the image, both sets of thrusters are visible, along with Neil's window with the LPD grid etched on it, the straps of the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC) coming out thru the hatch on the left, the upper portion of the ladder, the porch, and the plume deflector on the downward thruster on Buzz's side. The US flag that Neil and Buzz will deploy later is stowed in a long, thin canister attached to the underside of the lefthand rail of the ladder. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes that, thru the CDR's window, we can see " the crash bar, and a checklist/cue card that's been stuck under the overhead window with grey tape! -The same card can be seen right behind Neil in the post-EVA portrait, AS11-37-<a href="#5528" target="new">5528</a>".
1094027|AS11-40-5863|AS11-40-5863HR.jpg|109:40:27 Buzz has his PLSS most of the way out of the hatch. His feet are near the lip of the porch. Neil has moved around to the south of the ladder a little bit. Note the near-side handrail and the triangular Commander's window above and to the right of the hatch. There is a reflection of the lunar surface in the window. To Buzz's left, we can see a set of thrusters and the plume deflector that protects the LM from the downward thruster exhaust.
1094027|AS11-40-5865|AS11-40-5865HR.jpg|109:40:27 Rightward of 5864, showing south footpad and the bent probe. The <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a> is on the right side of the image. <a href="a11.1111231_bm.jpg" title="partial pan" target="new">Little West Crater</a> is slightly north of up-Sun, in the distance above the footpad. As can be determined from Mission Report <a href="a11mrf5-08.jpg" title="image" target="new">figure 5-8</a>, <a href="a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="new">Little West Crater</a> subtends about 35 degrees - 3 1/2 fiducial spacings - at the LM. The approximate extent of the crater is indicated in a <a href="a11det5865.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a>.
1094156|AS11-40-5866|AS11-40-5866HR.jpg|109:41:56 Buzz is jumping down to the top rung of the ladder and hasn't quite landed on it. He is gripping the handrail with both hands and, rather than walk down the ladder, he is hopping down. In a <a href="a11det5866.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> we can see the feedwater controls on the righthand corner of the bottom of Buzz's PLSS. In a <a href="a11lbl5866LEC-Tether.jpg" title="image" target="new">second detail</a> the LEC strap and hooks are labeled along with the strap and hooks of the waist tether Buzz has just attched to the porch rail. In the full photo, the MESA is immediately beyond the lower rungs of the ladder. John Sarkissian has spotted the TV lens peeking out from under the MESA blanket in an <a href="a11EnhcDet5866TV.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced detail</a>. Compare with training photo <a href="a11TVlblS69-31060.jpg" title="image" target="new">S69-31060</a>. Vlad Pustynski notes that the bright boulder visible just above the MESA and just to the right of the inside edge of the north strut can also be seen in 5903.
1094228|AS11-40-5867|AS11-40-5867HR.jpg|109:42:28 Buzz has reached the next to last rung and has transferred his grip from the porch rail to the outside rails that are on the ladder itself. The hatch is mostly closed and we can see the <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a> cover which is near the hinged side of the hatch. There are some taped instructions on the outside of the hatch. The hose at the right side of Buzz's PLSS which passes under his right arm would deliver emergency oxygen from the Oxygen Purge System (OPS) should he need it. We can also see the OPS actuator cable coming over his right shoulder. We can see some detail on the boot straps. There are <a href="../alsj-PLSSVelcro.html" target="new">horizontal strips of Velcro on the back of the PLSS</a>, which were apparently installed to give the astronauts, while in zero-gravity, a place to anchor their feet on the side bulkhead behind Neil's station. Near the bottom of the back of the PLSS, we can see a sewn-on set of instructions for PLSS recharge operations (not performed on Apollo 11) just above the semi-circular flap. Note that craters and rocks can be seen in the reflection of the lunar surface in Neil's window.
1094242|AS11-40-5868|AS11-40-5868HR.jpg|109:42:42 Buzz has reached the bottom rung of the ladder and is about the jump down to the footpad. As he said at the moment Neil took this picture, "Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up." The thermal shroud protecting the U.S. flag that Neil and Buzz deploy during the EVA can be seen on the underside of the lefthand ladder rail. See, also, NASA photo <a href="../mccraw.gif" title="image" target="new">S69-38755</a>. which shows the flag on a LM mockup in Houston. Ulli Lotzmann has provided a <a href="a11det5868valves.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> which shows the valve cluster on the right, front corner of the bottom of Buzz's PLSS.
1094253|AS11-40-5869|AS11-40-5869HR.jpg|109:42:53 Buzz has both feet on the footpad. His hands are between the third and fourth rungs. His bent knees suggest that he is about to try to jump up to the lowest rung. His OPS antenna is up.
1094625|AS11-40-5870|AS11-40-5870HR.jpg|109:46:25 This photo of the north footpad and probe indicates that the spacecraft drifted toward the south between contact and touchdown. A <a href="a11det5870.jpg" target="new">labeled detail</a> shows the probable point of initial contact, the final position of the probe tip, and a mound of soil built up on the south side of the footpad during its final motions. There seems to be a suggestion of an initial pad imprint about half a pad diameter north of its final location. Note the radial sweep pattern in the foreground soil created by the descent engine.
1094752|AS11-40-5871|AS11-40-5871HR.jpg|109:47:52 View to the south of the shadowed area behind the ladder. It is possible that this was an unintentional shot taken as Neil prepared to remove the MESA blankets. Journal Contributor AwE130 has identified the Contingency Sampler ring in this image. In a<a href="a11det5871CSC_Ring.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a>, it is just to the right and below center.
1100324|AS11-40-5872|AS11-40-5872HR.jpg|110:03:24. Buzz is deploying the Solar Wind Collector (SWC), a foil sheet which he is pointing at the Sun. Note the word 'Shade' printed on the bottom of the back side. The word 'Sun' is printed on the sunward side. At the end of the EVA, after leaving the SWC exposed to the Sun for about 1 hour and 17 minutes, Buzz will roll up the foil and pack it in a bag for analysis back on Earth. Note the considerable clearance between the bottom of the Descent Engine bell and the surface beneath it. Little West Crater is near the horizon on the lefthand side of the image. Note the pattern of scratch marks running from the MESA toward the lower left that were created by the TV cable as Neil took the camera away from the LM on the tripod. Neil's footprints are generally to the right of the cable scratches as he moved sideways out from the LM. Several potentially foot-grabbing loops remain in the cable. The rendezvous radar and various antennas on the top of the ascent stage are labeled in a detail ( <a href="a11det5872.jpg" title="image" target="new">223k</a> ). Each of the boot prints is about 33 cm long and has a greatest width of 15 cm.
1100329|AS11-40-5873|AS11-40-5873HR.jpg|Buzz has just deployed the Solar Wind Collector (SWC). Neil took the photo toward the southeast. Buzz is standing flat-footed next to the SWC, facing Neil, who is at about the 2 o'clock position out from the LM. In the lower right corner, notice the scratch marks that the TV cable made as Neil pulled it out. The multiple tracks were made by the individual cable loops scraping along the ground. We can see underneath the engine bell. Most of the surface in this image has not been disturbed as yet, and in the places where Neil and Buzz have walked, the disturbed surface is darker. Good illustration of this very common phenomenon. Jack Schmitt speculates that the Descent Engine plume swept away the smallest particles, leaving a higher than normal percentage of larger particles. The more jagged surface is a better reflector of sunlight than the normal surface and, therefore, appears brighter. Certainly, from orbit, the areas around the landed LM's are brighter than the normal surface. As they walk around, the astronauts disturb this modified surface and, in effect, restore it's normal condition. We see the MESA, in shadow, to the right of Buzz. On the front of Buzz's suit, we have the RCU, the camera bracket, and just above his crotch, the "Red Apple" activator for the purge valve. He has some dirt on his knees. A <a href="a11det5873.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> shows a snap hook fitted to the end of his neckring tiedown.
1100825|S69-38600|a11.s69-39600.jpg|This photo shows the Apollo 12 LM crew, Pete Conrad and Al Bean, and, behind them, their backups, Dave Scott (behind Al) and Jim Irwin, monitoring Apollo 11 activities after the landing.
1100925|S69-39815|ap11-S69-39815HR.jpg|Journal Contributors Brian Lawrence and Ken Glover note that this photo was taken in the MOCR at 110:09:25 while Neil and Buzz were deploying the U.S. Flag. Scan by Kipp Teague.
1100950|S69-40308|ap11-S69-40308.jpg|This frame from the 16-mm camera mounted in the LM window shows Neil (left) and Buzz (right) deploying the U.S. Flag. It was taken at about 110:09:50. Scan by Kipp Teague.
1101033|AS11-40-5874|AS11-40-5874HR.jpg|110:10:33 Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag. His fingertips are visible on the far side of his faceplate. Note the well-defined footprints in the foreground. Buzz is facing up-Sun. There is a reflection of the Sun in his visor. At the bottom of Buzz's faceplate, note the white 'rim' which is slightly separated from his neckring. This 'rim' is the bottom of his gold visor, which he has pulled down. We can see the LEC straps hanging down inside of the ladder strut. In the foreground, we can see the foot-grabbing loops in the TV cable. The double crater under Neil's LM window is just beyond the LM shadow.
1101038|AS11-40-5875|AS11-40-5875HR.jpg|110:10:33 Buzz and the U.S. flag. Note the well-defined footprints in the foreground. The shadows indicate that Buzz is standing with the Sun directly in front of him. There is a reflection of the Sun in his visor. We can see the LEC straps hanging down inside of the ladder strut. In the foreground, we can see the foot-grabbing loops in the TV cable. The double crater is beyond Buzz and the LM shadow. Journal Contributors Owen Merrick, Brian McInall, and Markus Mehring call attention to the fact that, in the high-resolution detail by Thomas Schwagmeier, we can see <a href="a11det5875BuzzFace.jpg" title="image" target="new">Buzz</a> peering over at Neil. In <a href="AS11-40-5874.jpg" title="image" target="new">5874</a> Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned his body slightly - and his head a great deal more - to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim. Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case "his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it. But in this case we're lucky." Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created a <a href="as11-40-5874-75.mov" target="new">two-frame movie</a> consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet. Note, in particular, the change in his knee positions. Both the TV record and the 16--mm film show Buzz turning in Neil's direction twice during this interval.
1102509|AS11-40-5876|AS11-40-5876HR.jpg|110:25:09 Buzz took this picture of a pristine surface before making a bootprint. He took the camera off the RCU bracket and took this series of bootprint pictures holding the camera in his hands. Buzz was in the field-of-view of the 16mm movie camera mounted in his LM window. A description of his actions follows 110:25:09.
1102514|AS11-40-5877|AS11-40-5877HR.jpg|110:25:09 Buzz made this footprint on a pristine surface so that he could then photograph it for study by soil mechanics experts.
1102519|AS11-40-5878|AS11-40-5878HR.jpg|110:25:09 Buzz moved away slightly to take this second image of the fresh bootprint, getting slightly better focus.
1102700|AS11-40-5879|AS11-40-5879HR.jpg|110:27:00 A close-up of the surface with a two-inch rock and, in the lower right corner, Buzz's boot and footprint. Near the upper left there appears to be a cohesive clump of soil lifted -or pushed - out of a bootprint.
1102710|AS11-40-5880|AS11-40-5880HR.jpg|Second photo of Buzz's second soil-mechanics bootprint.
1103147|AS11-40-5881|AS11-40-5881HR.jpg|110:31:47 This first frame from Buzz's <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> pan shows the southwestern wall of the younger component of the double crater. Buzz is standing on the northeast rim about 7 meters WSW of the ladder footpad. The diameter of this component is about 12 meters. The small crater near the top of the far wall can also be seen in Neil's earlier photo AS11-40-<a href="AS11-40-5853.jpg" title="image" target="new">5853</a>.
1103151|AS11-40-5882|AS11-40-5882HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5881, with very little overlap. Note the bright 'halo' around the shadow of Buzz's helmet due to some combination of diffraction around the helmet and/or the coincidence of maximum zero-phase backscatter with that part of Buzz's shadow. Markus Mehring notes that the horizon feature beyond Buzz's shadow is a portion of the rim of a cluster of overlapping craters west of the landing site, as indicated in a <a href="a11det5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="new">comparison</a> between details from 5882 and 82a and pre-landing overhead AS11-37-5447. The horizon feature at the righthand edge of 5882 is another portion of the cluster rims.
1103155|AS11-40-5882a|AS11-40-5882aHR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5882, with very little overlap. Buzz is standing near the tip of the LM shadow. A question from Journal Contributor Paolo Attivissimo led to a <a href="a11comp5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="new">side-by-side comparison between 5882 and 5882a</a>. By matching features in the overlap region, we see that, when Buzz turned to his right between the frames, he also moved to his right and forward. The fact that the separation of the images of a single rock is farther apart near the horizon than in the foreground is an indication that he moved to his right, and the greater tilt of the lines in the foreground is an indication of his motion forward. Journal Contributor Tom McKeever notes that 5882a includes the shadow of the rendezvous radar antenna, which is also shown in a <a href="../rendradar.jpg" title="image" target="new">LM-9</a> photo by Randy Attwood. Note the large rock just to the right of the LM shadow. A comparison with AS11-39-<a href="images11.html#5822" target="new">5822</a>, a picture Buzz took out his window after the EVA, shows how much the early-morning shadow changes in a few hours.
1103159|AS11-40-5883|AS11-40-5883HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5882a, looking northwest across the boulder field. The rock on the edge of the LM shadow appears to have split on impact.
1103204|AS11-40-5884|AS11-40-5884HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5883 toward the TV camera.
1103208|AS11-40-5885|AS11-40-5885HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5884 with the flag and the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) on the right. A 107:05:31.
1103212|AS11-40-5886|AS11-40-5886HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward of 5885. This frame from Buzz's plus-Z pan is the only good Hasselblad picture of Neil on the lunar surface. Eric Nelson has produced an enhance version ( <a href="a11det5886ecn.jpg" title="image" target="new">320k</a> ) of the portion of the image that includes the flag, the SWC, and Neil at the MESA. A closer detail ( <a href="a11det5886MESA.jpg" title="image" target="new">195k</a> ) shows Neil packing the bulk sample with an open rockbox on the MESA table. See the discussion following 110:31:47.

1103221|AS11-40-5888|AS11-40-5888HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5887. View along the northern rim of the older component of the double crater. Buzz is standing on the northeast rim of the younger component about 7 meters WSW of the ladder footpad. The diameter of the older component is about 10 meters.
1103225|AS11-40-5889|AS11-40-5889HR.jpg|110:31:47 Rightward from 5888. Shows the rest of the older, eastern portion of the double crater and crossing the image from the center of the right edge to the lower left corner, the rim of the younger, eastern component.
1103229|AS11-40-5890|AS11-40-5890HR.jpg|110:31:47 This next frame in Buzz's pan shows the eastern part of the younger component of the double crater.
1103413|AS11-40-5892|AS11-40-5892HR.jpg|110:34:13 Buzz took this picture of the surface beneath the LM from near the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> (south) strut. The engine bell is at the upper left. The probe on the south footpad is at right center and we can see how that probe was dragged from the initial contact point. The <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jettison bag</a> is in the foreground, with two anonymous pieces of trash next to it. They may be pieces of padding from the Sample Return Container (SRC), also known as the rock box, which Neil opened shortly after deploying the TV.
1103419|AS11-40-5893|AS11-40-5893HR.jpg|110:34:13 Buzz is still near the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> footpad and pointed the camera up to take this picture of the Ascent Stage. It shows the thrusters on Neil's side of the spacecraft.
1103426|AS11-40-5894|AS11-40-5894HR.jpg|110:34:13 This underexposed picture of the Ascent Stage shows Neil at the MESA (lower left corner). The fact that Neil is in this picture was first noticed by Apollo historian Andrew Chaikin. See, also, a <a href="a11det5894.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> of Neil. An <a href="as11-5894enhnc.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced version</a> of the detail by Ulli Lotzmann shows that Neil has his side visor pulled forward and that his gold visor is up.
1103433|AS11-40-5895|AS11-40-5895HR.jpg|110:34:13 In this picture of the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> footpad and lower strut, we see Neil's legs as he stands at the MESA.
1103440|AS11-40-5896|AS11-40-5896HR.jpg|110:34:13 Similar to 5895. Ulli Lotzmann has captured a high-resolution detail ( <a href="a11det5896.jpg" title="photo detail" target="new">307k</a> ) showing the sunlit toe of Neil's left boot - the one he used to step onto the lunar surface for the first time - and, with contrast enhancement, his knees and lower leg. Neil is facing to the right and slightly toward the camera. Because of that stance and the fact that he has the lower part of his right leg bent back slightly, the right toe is in the deep shadow. Journal Contribributor Robert Hartfield, recalling Kipp Teague's enhancement of Apollo 15 photo AS15-88-<a href="../a15/images15.html#11882" target="new">11882</a> that revealed details of the damage to the descent engine bell during landing, wondered if enhancement of photos of the shadowed area around the Apollo 11 ladder footpad would show any footprints. He suggested Neil's photos 5859, 60, 61, 69 and Buzz's photo 5896. Kipp was unable to bring out any surface details from the suggested Armstrong photos, but had <a href="AS11-40-5896-enhanced.jpg" title="image" target="new">success with 5896</a>, probably because of different camera settings.
1104107|AS11-40-5897|AS11-40-5897HR.jpg|110:41:07 After finishing at the MESA, Neil joined Buzz at the ladder. Buzz gave the camera to Neil, who took four frames of the plaque on the ladder strut and three pictures of the bulk sample area. This is the first of the plaque photos. Syd Buxton has provided a cleaned-up version of a <a href="MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C.jpg" title="image" target="new">B&amp;W reproduction of the plaque</a> he found on the MSFC website.
1104113|AS11-40-5898|AS11-40-5898HR.jpg|110:41:07 Similar to 5897. Second of Neil's plaque photos.
1104117|AS11-40-5899|AS11-40-5899HR.jpg|110:41:07 Neil either taken a longer exposure or has changed the f-stop setting. Best of the plaque pictures.
1104122|AS11-40-5900|AS11-40-5900HR.jpg|110:41:07 Neil took this picture of the ladder strut from the left at a lower f-stop number than he used for 5899. Ulli Lotzmann provides a <a href="AS11-40-5900HRPlusText.jpg" target="new">detail</a> with the flag container, its attachment bracket, and the plaque cover labelled.
1104214|AS11-40-5901|AS11-40-5901HR.jpg|110:42:14 Photo of the bulk sample area from just north of the ladder.
1104219|AS11-40-5902|AS11-40-5902HR.jpg|110:42:14 Buzz is standing just beyond the north strut. Note the distinctive dust smudges on Buzz's legs. The photo also shows the furrows in the bulk sample area and the area to the left of the footpad that shows unmistakable signs of sweeping by the descent engine exhaust. In a <a href="a11det5902.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> Ulli Lotzmann notes a reflected image of the rendezvous radar. Karl Dodenhoff writes that the strap hanging down from behind Buzz's RCU is "the neck ring pull-down strap. It connected to the pull down locking mechanism that also served as the <a href="../alsj-suitb.jpg" title="image" target="new">upper PLSS/RCU attachment fitting</a> on the chest of the A7L suit." Mick Hyde provides a <a href="a11anders.jpg" title="image" target="new">photo</a> taken in 2002 of Bill Ander's Apollo 8 suit at the Science Museum London. The strap is tucked into a pouch. The A7L suit was used prior to Apollo 15, when the LM crews started using the A7L-B.
1104224|AS11-40-5903|AS11-40-5903HR.jpg|110:42:14 Neil has moved to the MESA. Ulli Lotzmann has captured a <a href="a11ArmstrongTakes5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">frame</a> from the 16mm film showing Neil as he takes 5903. No other Apollo photograph has been reproduced as often as this portrait of Buzz. Neil is, of course, visible in reflection on Buzz's visor. Buzz has his left arm raised and is probably reading the checklist sewn on the wrist cover of his glove, which is shown in a <a href="a11det5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a>. He is moving his right foot forward, as can be seen by the mound of dirt building up in front of the toe of that boot. Note the dirt adhering to Buzz's boots and knees. Otherwise, he is remarkably clean. The "Red Apple", which he would grab and pull to open his purge valve in the event of a suit leak or a PLSS failure, is located roughly over his navel. From our perspective, the purge valve is installed in the connector to the left of the "Red Apple".
1104333|AS11-40-5904|AS11-40-5904.jpg|110:43:33 Unintended photo of one of the suits, probably taken when Buzz got the camera either from Neil or off the MESA.
1104336|AS11-40-5905|AS11-40-5905HR.jpg|110:43:33 This photo was taken from the north of the LM. Buzz has taken the camera out there to take a pan, as per checklist. This is an excellent picture of the flag, the TV cable, and, in the background, some boulders on the local ridge. Taken toward the southwest.
1104340|AS11-40-5906|AS11-40-5906HR.jpg|110:43:33 Down-Sun. Rightward of 5905.
1104344|AS11-40-5907|AS11-40-5907HR.jpg|110:43:33 Rightward of 5906. TV camera just left of center. The sharp-rimmed crater on the apparent horizon is centered in 5856, a frame from Buzz's plus-Z pan.
1104348|AS11-40-5908|AS11-40-5908HR.jpg|110:43:33 Rightward of 5907. The blocks on the western rim of the nearly-rimless crater on the righthand side on the apparent horizon suggest that this crater is a West Crater secondary.

1104416|AS11-40-5915|AS11-40-5915HR.jpg|110:43:33 Rightward of 5914. The MESA is in the shadowed area at right center with the rockbox on the right-front corner.
1104420|AS11-40-5916|AS11-40-5916HR.jpg|110:43:33 Rightward of 5915. Neil has passed in front of Buzz, carrying the Gold camera. We can see the back of his suit and his legs but, unfortunately, there is no sign of the Gold camera in the image. The Solar Wind Collector is right of center. Journal Contributor Rob South calls attention to the lighter-colored surface in the center foreground. As we know from orbital photos, the area around the LM is scoured by the descent engine and that the scoured area has a higher albedo and, hence a lighter color. Once the astronauts get outside, they knock the soil around with their feet and restore the immediate area to something like its normal brightness. This can be seen quite dramatically in any number of post-EVA taken out the LM windows on A11 and the other missions and even in high-res details from Pan camera frames. When the astronauts work well away from the LM, they are on surfaces undisturbed by the descent engine and the soil they disturb does not have a noticeably different albedo from undisturbed soil. The patch of lighter-colored soil in 5916 has been scoured by Eagle's descent engine but has not yet been disturbed by the crew.
1104718|AS11-40-5917|AS11-40-5917HR.jpg|110:47:18 Buzz still has the Hasselblad camera and is taking photographs while he does an inspection of the LM. This is a close-up of the north footpad, showing the buried probe. The triangular-shape imprint on the soil next to the footpad can also be seen in AS11-40- <a href="AS11-40-5903.jpg" title="image" target="new">5903</a> and appears to have been made by a cable or strap. My thanks to Journal Contributor Ken MacTaggart, who called attention to the imprint.

The U.S. flag is to the left of the strut, partially hidden by the strut support.
1105026|AS11-40-5923|AS11-40-5923HR.jpg|110:50:26 View of Earth over the LM. As is discussed in the text, there is some uncertainty about who took these pictures of Earth. Australia is in sunlight on the left side of the Earth image which, as Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes, confirms the obvious since the EVA video came thru Honeysuckle Creek and Parkes. Compare with a <a href="a11-110-50-26.jpg" title="image" target="new">Stellarium view of Earth</a> from Tranquility Base at 110:50:26, created by Journal Contributor Syd Buxton.

1105129|AS11-40-5925|AS11-40-5925HR.jpg|110:51:29 Photo of the east footpad. Note the difference in materials used to cover the footpad on the engine-facing surfaces as compared with the outer surfaces.
1105135|AS11-40-5926|AS11-40-5926HR.jpg|110:51:29 LM east footpad close-up. At landing, the LM weight was about 16,000 terrestrial pounds. In the lunar gravity field, therefore, each of the four footpads is bearing a weight of about 670 pounds or 300 kilograms. There is a buildup of soil on the south side, indicating that the spacecraft was moving in that direction at touchdown. Otherwise, the footpad did not make much of an impression.
1105220|AS11-40-5927|AS11-40-5927HR.jpg|110:53:38. Neil now has the Hasselblad. Buzz is preparing to remove the passive seismometer from the lefthand compartment in the SEQ bay. The LRRR is in the righthand compartment. The bay is between the east and south struts and has two doors: a vertically-hinged door at Buzz's left and a horizontally-hinged door which can be seen above the right side of the bay. Buzz pulled on a pulley-mounted tape to raise the latter door. The tape is visible to his right, draped over the support for the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Z</a> (east) strut. Diagrams on <a href="../SEQdoors.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 58</a> of Scott Sullivan's <i>Virtual LM</i> illustrate the way the main door is hinged. Additonal details can be found on pages 38 to 47. To the right of Buzz, and underneath the Descent Stage is a shield to protect the landing radar from the heat of the Descent Engine. Note the object next to the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Z (east) strut</a>. As noted by Journal Contributor Markus Mehring, at the end of Buzz's transmission at 110:52:20 when he says "gradual sideways hops", we see him working at the SEQ Bay and discarding the object to his right. As noted above, the object ends up next to the minus-Z east strut. Contributor Paul Fjeld writes that the discarded object is ":a small sheet of 5-mil, aluminized Kapton with two little handles that covered the door-deployment tapes."] "There was a similar 5-mil sheet that covered the S-band deployable antenna on Quad 1. The new scans of mag S (from original film in 2004) show the detail of the Quad 1 installation really well. You can see a single handle on the left-bottom part of the quad near the downlock latch shield (little white rectangle) and I can even convince myself that I can make out the little 'fingers' that held the blanket on (with tape to hold them). The astronaut yanked the handle(s) revealing deployment lanyards velcroed inside which pulled out the two 'Antenna Release Pins', the label of which we can now read thanks to Kipp's good work. I re-did the LM-13 blanket at the Cradle Museum after I saw those shots (thanks Kipp!).". </i>
1105338|AS11-40-5928|AS11-40-5928HR.jpg|110:53:38 Buzz is pulling the passive seismometer from the lefthand compartment in the SEQ bay. Erik van Meijgaarden has extended our view to the right with part of 5929 to create a <a href="a11pan5928-29.jpg" title="mini-pan" target="new">mini-pan</a>.
1105345|AS11-40-5929|AS11-40-5929HR.jpg|110:53:38. Buzz is draping a pulley tape over the lefthand door.
1105549|AS11-40-5930|AS11-40-5930HR.jpg|110:55:49. Neil has backed away from the LM to take a panorama. This down-Sun shows the bright halo that appeared around the shadow of Neil's helmet due to some combination of diffraction around the helmet and/or the coincidence of maximum zero-phase backscatter with that part of Neil's shadow. Note, also, how washed out the scene is along the line of his shadow. This effect is due to the fact that, in this direction, all of the shadows - excepting only those cast by objects in the immediate foreground - are hidden by the objects that cast them. The double crater below Neil's LM window is in the middle distance.
1105554|AS11-40-5931|AS11-40-5931HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5930. In this second photo from Neil's minus-Z (east) pan, Buzz has removed the passive seismometer package from the SEQ bay. The foreground object with the handle is the <a href="a11det5931goldcam.jpg" title="image" target="new">Gold camera</a>, designed to take close-up photographs of the very top layer of the lunar soil. Note, also, the split rock at the right edge, just below the center of the photograph. This boulder was probably ejected from a nearby impact, possibly West Crater, and broke into two pieces when it hit. A different boulder, just to the left of center near the tip of the LM shadow in <a href="#5883" target="new">5883</a>, appears to have suffered a similar fate.
1105559|AS11-40-5932|AS11-40-5932HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5931, with good overlap. The split boulder is at the lower left. Note the relative darkness of the areas disturbed by the crew at the center of the photograph.

1105616|AS11-40-5935|AS11-40-5935HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5934. Most of the rocks on the left and within a few tens of meters of the LM and are relatively small. As shown in a <a href="a11LittleWest5935.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">detail</a>, the northern part of <a href="a11EastCraterRIP.html" target="new">Little West Crater</a> can be seen in the sun glare above center.
1105621|AS11-40-5936|AS11-40-5936HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5935 but without overlap because Neil has avoided the up-Sun view. The southern part of Little West Crater on the lefthand side of the image. Part of the rim of West Crater can be seen faintly just above center. We can locate the approximate azimuths of the north and South rims of West Crater from Figure 3-15 ( <a href="a11photomap.gif" target="new">196 k</a> ) in the <a href="as11psr.pdf" target="new">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a> and a <a href="a11GEO-LM.jpg" title="map detail" target="new">detail</a> from the <a href="A11-Geo-Map.JPG" title="image" target="new">USGS site map</a>. As indicated in Figure 3-15 ( <a href="a11psrf3-15.jpg" target="new">280k</a> ), Neil took the minus-Z pan from a location about 20 meters roughly southeast of the LM. The exact location has been added to the inset at the upper right, which shows that Neil was about 55 meters due west of the south rim of Little West Crater. From the <a href="a11GEO-LM.jpg" title="map detail" target="new">site map detail</a> we see that, from the south rim of Little West Crater, the north rim of West Crater is about 460 meters away on an azimuth of about 92.7 degrees. With the help of a little trigonometry, this information gives an azimuth of the north rim of West Crater from Neil's location of 92.4 degrees, with the south rim azimuth being about 112.4 degrees. During the Apollo 11 EVA, the solar azimuth was 88.1 degrees, which allows us to plot the relevant azimuths on a <a href="a11det5936.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail from 5936</a>. The plotted azimuth for the south rim is very close to the lefthand edge of the horizon feature that is obviously a partly shadowed portion of the rim while the plotted north rim azimuth is close to the righthand edge of what is probably a sunlit, rock-strewn portion of the rim.
1105627|AS11-40-5937|AS11-40-5937HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5936.

1105643|AS11-40-5940|AS11-40-5940HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5939. View to the south. Note the rounded crater rim on the horizon just to the left of center.
1105648|AS11-40-5941|AS11-40-5941HR.jpg|110:55:49. Rightward of 5940. This down-Sun is the final frame in Neil's pan.
1105816|AS11-40-5942|AS11-40-5942HR.jpg|110:58:16. This photograph is the first in a sequence of pictures Neil took of Buzz carrying the EASEP out to the deployment site a short way south of the spacecraft. In this picture, he is walking across the raised rim of the small crater he comments on at 110:58:16. Note the spray of dust spreading out in front of his left boot. The piece of equipment in his right hand is the LRRR, while the seismometer package is in his left hand. Note that, in this view from behind Buzz, we are seeing his OPS antenna edge on. In lower-quality scans and prints, it all but disappears. A <a href="a11detB5942.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">detail</a> shows the two columns of <a href="../alsj-PLSSVelcro.html" target="new">horizontal Velcro strips on the back of his PLSS</a>.
1105824|AS11-40-5943|AS11-40-5943HR.jpg|110:58:24. Buzz has gone beyond the small crater and is looking for a flat spot on which to put the LRRR. Note the depth of the footprints he has left in the soft rim of the crater. Beyond the crater, where he is standing at this moment, his footprints are only a fraction of an inch deep and are more typical of the footprints that he and Neil normally leave. Note that Buzz has just walked between some rounded, partially-buried boulders, which he mentions at 110:58:24. This picture is the first of a stereopair Neil takes of them.
1105829|AS11-40-5944|AS11-40-5944HR.jpg|110:58:24. Neil has stepped to his left to get a stereo companion to 5943. Note the build up of soil on the base of these boulders due to ejecta from the foreground crater. Note that there is another split boulder in this photograph, to Buzz's right. From 5948, we know that Buzz will put the LRRR down northwest of this boulder and the seismometer southeast of it. This means that at some point after 5944, Buzz will move about 10 meters (30 feet) to his right. Figure 3-16 ( <a href="a11traverse.gif" target="new">196k</a> re-draft by Thomas Schwagmeier) in the <i>Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</i> shows his path from the SEQ Bay out to the deployment area.
1105928|AS11-40-5945|AS11-40-5945HR.jpg|110:59:28 Buzz has put the LRRR down on the surface and has turned to his left to find a spot for the seismometer.
1110001|AS11-37-5549|AS11-37-5549HR.jpg|Same as AS11-37-5548. In a <a href="a11lbl5549_alscc.jpg" target="new">labeled detail</a>, Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski has identified a boulder Neil examined at about 111:00:01 and then left the Gold Camera upright on it while he deployed the LRRR and took documentation photos. See <a href="#5952" target="new">AS11-40-5952</a>, which shows the ALSCC upright on this boulder. Neil grabbed the ASLCC at the start of his run to Little West Crater and took it with him.
1110001|AS11-39-5842|AS11-39-5842HR.jpg|Same as AS11-39-5841, again a bit better. In a <a href="a11lbl5842_alscc.jpg" target="new">labeled detail</a>, Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski has identified a boulder Neil examined at about 111:00:01 and then left the Gold Camera upright on it while he deployed the LRRR and took documentation photos. See <a href="#5952" target="new">AS11-40-5952</a>, which shows the ALSCC upright on this boulder. Neil grabbed the ASLCC at the start of his run to Little West Crater and took it with him.
1110001|AS11-45-6713|AS11-45-6713.jpg|111:00:01 Surface of a large piece of basalt. Note the large zap pit above center near the righthand edge. This boulder is probably the one Neil examined just as he was going out of the TV field-of-view to the right. After he finished examining this boulder, Neil left the ALSCC upright on the boulder surface while he deployed the LRRR and took Hasselblad documentation, as can be seen in <a href="#5952" target="new">AS11-40-5952</a>. The boulder is about 3 meters ENE of the LRRR. Red-blue anaglyph created by Erwin D'Hoore.
1110001|AS11-45-6714|AS11-45-6714A.jpg|111:00:01 Surface of a large piece of basalt, probably the one near the LRRR. Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski has identified this boulder in <a href="#5549" target="new">AS11-37-5549</a> and <a href="#5842" target="new">AS11-39-5842</a>, pictures Neil took out is window after the EVA.
1110456|AS11-40-5946|AS11-40-5946HR.jpg|111:04:56 Buzz has placed the seismometer package on the surface and is using a built-in maneuvering handle to adjust the pointing and leveling. Note the dirt that he has pushed out of the way on the south side of the package in his attempt to get it level. Note, also, that the eastern rim of the double crater under Neil's LM window can be seen at the left edge of this photograph. The Gold camera is to the right of Buzz and the LRRR is to the left of him with the TV camera beyond.
1110620|AS11-40-5947|AS11-40-5947HR.jpg|111:06:20 Buzz may still be trying to get the seismometer leveled. As he tells Houston, the west side solar array "deployed automatically". He has not yet deployed the east side solar array. Note the baton-like transmitting antenna and the three-pronged (cricket wicket) gnomon on the top of the main package. There are two release pins on the ground about 1 - 2 meters to the right of Buzz's feet and other pieces of discarded hardware nearby. Note the closed configuration of the SEQ Bay doors on the LM descent stage. The 'Gold' camera is between Buzz and the spacecraft.
1110634|AS11-40-5948|AS11-40-5948HR.jpg|Neil took this picture at about 111:06:34. Buzz has now deployed both the east and west solar panels on the seismometer. He is looking toward the LM, perhaps to get a reference for his alignment. A labelled drawing of the <a href="a11PSEP_NASM.jpg" title="line drawing" target="new">PSEP</a> includes dimenions provided by Allan Needell of the National Air and Space Museum.
1110639|AS11-40-5949|AS11-40-5949HR.jpg|111:06:34 Neil took this picture not long after taking 5948. <a href="a11Photogrammetry.html" target="new">Photogrammetric analysis</a> indicates that he moved about 3.2 meters to his left between frames and this may be the moment when he goes out of the TV field-of-view. This picture gives us a good view of the split boulder that is between the two experiments. In the background, we can see the LM, the U.S. flag, and the TV camera. Note the footprints at the lower right. The astronaut who made them seems to have been moving from right to left. The rightmost footprint made with his left boot has a very deep toe imprint while the rightmost imprint made by his right boot is relatively flat and uniform. While bringing his left foot forward for the next step, he seems to have been dragging his heel, a clear indication that he was walking flat-foot, rather then hopping or running. The next left-boot toe print is deep while above it, we see that he was also scuffing his right heel along the surface. Note that the next prints made by both boots indicate that he turned to his right.
1110644|AS11-40-5950|AS11-40-5950HR.jpg|111:06:34 Similar to 5949 and taken from virtually the same spot. Buzz's shadow is falling on the split boulder.
1110649|AS11-40-5951|AS11-40-5951HR.jpg|111:06:34 Buzz may still be trying to get the seismometer leveled. Harald Kucharek notes that, through the visor, we can see Buzz face and suggests that he is looking over at Neil. See a detail ( <a href="a11face5951.jpg" title="image&quot;" target="new">128k</a> ).
1110740|AS11-40-5952|AS11-40-5952HR.jpg|111:07:40 Post-deployment documentation photo of the LRRR with the stereo camera perched on a flat-topped rock in the background. As of December 2010, the retroreflectors were still being used in conjunction with a <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/mlrs/" target="new">dedicated facility</a> at the MacDondald Observatory in Texas. In a <a href="a11lbl5549_alscc.jpg" target="new">labeled version</a> of AS11-37-5549, Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski has identified the boulder where Neil put the stereo camera while he deployed the LRRR and took documentation photos. After he and Buzz completed their EASEP activities, Neil grabbed the stereo camera and took it with him when he ran out to Little West Crater to take an unscheduled partial pan. Vlad also calls attention to a <a href="a11-LRRR_ClevisFasteners.html" target="new">discarded fitting</a> to the right of the LRRR. During training, this fitting came to be known as the "hockey stick"
1110943|AS11-40-5953|AS11-40-5953HR.jpg|111:09:43 Close-up of the seismometer leveling device. Poor focus.
1111131|AS11-40-5954|AS11-40-5954HR.jpg|111:11:31. Neil has run about 60 meters east of the LM to look at Little West Crater. The crater is about 30 meters in diameter and Neil is taking a partial pan from the WSW rim. This is the first frame of that pan. It shows the north and east wall and a pile of debris in the bottom. The Gold camera, which Neil has brought out with him, is at the left. Markus Mehring notes that the flat dome on the horizon near the left edge may be a rim segment in the distinctive cluster of craters just outside the landing ellipse to the north. See the discussion following 107:05:31.
1111137|AS11-40-5955|AS11-40-5955HR.jpg|111:11:31. Rightward of 5954. Note the fractured, angular blocks in the bottom of the crater.
1111143|AS11-40-5956|AS11-40-5956HR.jpg|111:11:31. Leftward of 5955 and taken from a point farther to Neil's right from the place where he took 5954.
1111149|AS11-40-5957|AS11-40-5957HR.jpg|111:11:31. Leftward of 5956.
1111155|AS11-40-5958|AS11-40-5958HR.jpg|111:11:31. We don't know if Neil purposefully changed position to take a stereopair, but he had stepped to his right after taking 5957.
1111201|AS11-40-5959|AS11-40-5959HR.jpg|111:11:31. Similar to 5958 but taken from half a step left.

1111213|AS11-40-5961|AS11-40-5961HR.jpg|111:11:31. Leftward of 5960. Down-Sun photograph of the LM from the rim of Little West Crater. We can see Neil's shadow and the shadow of the Gold camera. Note that the doors of the SEQ bay are closed. This frame gives us a feeling for elevation of the rim. When he took this picture, Neil was clearly standing above the level of the LM footpads. Note the darkened tracks leading leftward to the EASEP deployment area and rightward to the TV camera. Compare with the LPI traverse map ( <a href="a11_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="map" target="new">1.32Mb</a> ). Buzz is at the MESA on the far, righthand side of the spacecraft.
1111220|AS11-40-5962|AS11-40-5962HR.jpg|Down-Sun photograph of the LM taken by Neil during his return from the rim of Little West Crater. The split boulder noted on the righhand edge of <a href="#5931" target="new">5931</a> is in the foreground in line with the south (minus-Y) footpad. Buzz is still at the MESA.
1111513|AS11-40-5963|AS11-40-5963HR.jpg|111:15:13 Buzz attempting to drive the first of two on a core tubes into the surface. He was only able to get it in about 20 cm (8 inches). The Solar Wind Collector is just beyond the core tube and the TV camera is at the extreme left. Buzz's feedwater controls can be seen on the front, right hand corner of the bottom of his PLSS, as shown in a <a href="a11det5963.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a>. Note the snap hook attached to the neckring tiedown strap hanging at the front of his suit. Note that areas where Neil and Buzz have disturbed and scattered soil are darker than undisturbed areas.
1111518|AS11-40-5964|AS11-40-5964HR.jpg|111:15:13 Buzz has just struck a glancing blow on the top of the extension handle which, in turn, is attached to the top of the core tube. He is using the flat of the hammer.
1112705|AS11-40-5965|AS11-40-5965.jpg|111:27:05 This image is either the first of those film advances or an accicental frame taking while Neil was getting ready to advance the film. It gives a view to the southeast, with some deeply shadowed Mylar - possibly part of the MESA blanket - on the left. On the surface, we see the parallel shadows of the minus-Y (south) strut and probe. Compare with <a href="#5850" target="new">5850</a>.
1112711|AS11-40-5966|AS11-40-5966.jpg|111:27:05 Similar to 5965.

Andrew Vignaux suggests that the fuzzy area at the lower left is part of Neil's suit - probably Neil's left arm - which, because it is so close to the camera, is out of focus.
1112731|AS11-40-5968|AS11-40-5968HR.jpg|111:27:05 Similar to 5967.
1112738|AS11-40-5969|AS11-40-5969HR.jpg|111:27:05 This frame captures more of Neil's suit.
1112745|AS11-40-5970|a11det5970.jpg|111:27:05 Similar to 5969. Sunstruck after the magazine was removed from the camera. The blocky object at the top of the "suit" may be Neil's OPS, as indicated in a <a href="a11det5970.jpg" title="image" target="new">labeled detail</a>.
